                    "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective</SPAN>:<p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</strong></p><p>European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, enabling young people across Europe to set up joint projects, organise exchanges and promote trainings (e.g. for youth leaders) through both physical and online activities. The action will be implemented through two lots supporting transnational partnerships for youth organisations either at grassroots level or in large-scale partnerships, aiming to reinforce the European dimension of their activities, including on how to live better together after the pandemic and helping to design sustainable future ways of living, in line with the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative.</p><p>Important thematic priorities for both sub-actions are working with and promoting the EU Youth Goals and, in general, the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027246. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission’s political guideline. Project proposals may also treat the themes of the ‘Conference for the Future of Europe’.</p><p>Young people and youth organisations are key actors in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness, and how to improve quality of life after the pandemic, which concur with challenges related to digital skills and sustainable green lifestyles.</p><p><strong>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</strong></p><p>The action seeks to specifically support:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the promotion and development of more transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all against a backdrop of the backlashes on socio-economic structures and in line with the EU Youth Strategy, the EU Youth Goals and the Youth Dialogue;</li><li>The implementation of EU Frameworks and initiatives such as country specific recommendations from the European Semester as far as they relate to the youth area;</li><li>Initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcasing commonalities among young Europeans and encouraging discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations, including by providing a meaningful voice to youth in the framework of the Covid-19 recovery process;</li><li>the promotion of participation of under-represented groups of young people in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations by engaging vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth;</li><li>New ways to empower youth organisations in dealing with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, by supporting innovative ways of cooperation and network creation, development and management. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context through non-formal learning methods and organisational models such as alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid.</li><li>The reinforcement of the European dimension of the activities of youth organisations, including activities on how to live better together after the pandemic and helping to design sustainable future ways of living transnationally.</li> </ul>\n"

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p></p><p><span>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones’ mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union Workplan</span><span> for Sport</span><span> (2021-2024)</span><span>. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span></p><p><span> To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. </span><strong>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</strong><span><span> In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its </span><span>participants,</span><span> in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> Furthermore, </span><strong><span>developing digital </span><span>skills and competences</span><span> and skills in forward-looking fields</span></strong><span><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. </span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span> This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. </span></span><strong>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</strong><span><span> for the European Union's future. </span><span>This issue </span><span>can also be targeted</span><span> through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span>In line with the European Union’s priorities in making sustainable its economy, </span><strong><span>projects </span><span>should be designed</span><span> in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</span></strong><span><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them </span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality</span><span> education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span> The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>\n\"}"

These innovative approaches should not only provide today’s and tomorrow’s workers with the appropriate skills for rapidly-changing labour markets, but should also arm today’s and tomorrow’s workforce with creativity and skills to confront the growing complexity of societal challenges that we all face such as climate change, the protection of bio-diversity, clean energy, public health, digitalization and automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis.</p><p>This action will aim to foster <strong>innovation, creativity and participation</strong>, as well as social entrepreneurship in different fields of education and training, within sectors or across sectors and disciplines.</p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Projects </strong>are large-scale projects that aim to <strong>identify, develop, test and/or assess innovative (policy) approaches</strong> that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed, thus improving education and training systems. They will support forward-looking ideas responding to <strong>key European priorities </strong>and that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education, training and youth systems, as well as to bring a substantial innovative effect in terms of methods and practices to all types of learning and active participation settings for Europe's social cohesion.</p><p>The goal is to support transnational cooperation projects implementing a coherent and comprehensive set of <strong>sectoral or cross-sectoral activities</strong> that either:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>foster innovation</strong> in terms of scope, ground-breaking methods and practices, and/or</li><li>ensure <strong>a transfer of innovation</strong> (across countries, policy sectors or target groups), thus ensuring at European level a sustainable exploitation of innovative project results and/or transferability into different contexts and audiences.</li> </ul><p>The partnerships should be composed of a mix of public and private organisations combining researchers, practitioners and partners with the capacity to reach policy-makers.</p><p>Forward-Looking Projects should therefore be implemented by a mixed partnership of organisations:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>based on excellence and state of the art knowledge,</li><li>having the capacity to innovate,</li><li>able to generate systemic impact through their activities and the potential to drive the policy agenda in the fields of education and training.</li> </ul><p>Supported projects will aim at achieving systemic impact at European level by having the capacity to deploy their innovative outcomes on a European scale and/or by being able to transfer them into different thematic or geographical contexts.</p><p><strong>Lot 3: Adult learning</strong></p><p>Projects under Lot 3 address the adult learning policy area.

The diverse landscape of adult training opportunities is difficult to navigate in many Member States, and it is often uncertain for observers whether a specific opportunity is of good quality and will subsequently be of value on the labour market. For adults, this reduces the incentives to search for and take up such opportunities. For potential funding bodies, either public authorities or employers, it reduces the willingness to increase their investment in skills development. National registries of quality-assured and labour market relevant training opportunities have been used as an innovative tool to tackle these challenges in several Member States, often linked to financial support for individuals to take up the opportunities in these registries, sometimes also including information on guidance and validation opportunities. Quality information on the provision of guidance and validation opportunities would also help their potential beneficiaries to engage in their use and make the best choice. Projects will identify methods and mechanisms to help ensure that such registries, once operational, reach a significant number of users because they:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improve the communication between the “world of education and training” and the “world of work” (e.g. involving skills intelligence, social partners, education and training providers and other relevant stakeholders in their governance);</li><li>Strike a good balance between ensuring quality and providing a diverse offer of opportunities that is responsive to labour market needs;</li><li>Combine simplicity from the user perspective with appropriate flexibility at the “back end”/concerning the included opportunities (e.g. possibility of “multiple routes” into the registry, regional differentiation of the included opportunities etc.); and</li><li>Catalyse additional investments for training (e.g. by becoming a trusted reference for public schemes providing financial support for training, or collective or company-level bargaining about training entitlements).</li><li>Are interoperable with other national registries and the Europass Platform thanks to their use of the standards of the European Learning Model (data scheme).</li> </ul><p><strong>Priority 7: Supporting the Pact for Skills</strong></p><p>The Pact for Skills is the first flagship action of the 2020 European Skills Agenda. The Pact is firmly anchored in the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and supports the goals of the Green Deal and the digital transformation, as set out in the Commission communication “A strong Social Europe for Just Transitions”. It also contributes to reaching the EU target of 60% of adults participating in training every year by 2030, as set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan.</p><p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p><p>Forward-Looking Projects intend to provide innovative solutions that can be mainstreamed at regional, national and European level and ideally with the potential to be developed further either by EU funding or else through national and regional support.</p><p>The bottom-up practices should correctly address the fixed priorities set to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity, make a strong impact on education and training reforms and initiate systemic change.</p><p>Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels, also taking national, European Industrial Ecosystems and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, Forward-Looking Projects are expected to make cathartic impact at system level to help education and training systems better meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.</p><p><strong>Award criteria</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance of the project - (maximum 30 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Link to EU policy and initiatives</strong>: the proposal establishes and develops a project that supports a forward-looking idea at EU level, taking into account and fostering existing EU tools and initiatives (if relevant).

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, , including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. In line with the European Union’s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </p>\n\"}"

                    "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Forward-looking Projects</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose of the action</strong></p><p>Following the recent pandemic, <strong>the need for innovation in our education and training systems, as well as youth, has never been so great. </strong>Innovation in teaching and learning is crucial, at individual level as well as at institutional level. These innovative approaches should not only provide today’s and tomorrow’s workers with the appropriate skills for rapidly-changing labour markets, but should also arm today’s and tomorrow’s workforce with creativity and skills to confront the growing complexity of societal challenges that we all face such as climate change, the protection of bio-diversity, clean energy, public health, digitalization and automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis.</p><p>This action will aim to foster <strong>innovation, creativity and participation</strong>, as well as social entrepreneurship in different fields of education and training, within sectors or across sectors and disciplines.</p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Projects </strong>are large-scale projects that aim to <strong>identify, develop, test and/or assess innovative (policy) approaches</strong> that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed, thus improving education and training systems. They will support forward-looking ideas responding to <strong>key European priorities </strong>and that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education, training and youth systems, as well as to bring a substantial innovative effect in terms of methods and practices to all types of learning and active participation settings for Europe's social cohesion.</p><p>The goal is to support transnational cooperation projects implementing a coherent and comprehensive set of <strong>sectoral or cross-sectoral activities</strong> that either:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>foster innovation</strong> in terms of scope, ground-breaking methods and practices, and/or</li><li>ensure <strong>a transfer of innovation</strong> (across countries, policy sectors or target groups), thus ensuring at European level a sustainable exploitation of innovative project results and/or transferability into different contexts and audiences.</li> </ul><p>The partnerships should be composed of a mix of public and private organisations combining researchers, practitioners and partners with the capacity to reach policy-makers.</p><p>Forward-Looking Projects should therefore be implemented by a mixed partnership of organisations:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>based on excellence and state of the art knowledge,</li><li>having the capacity to innovate,</li><li>able to generate systemic impact through their activities and the potential to drive the policy agenda in the fields of education and training.</li> </ul><p>Supported projects will aim at achieving systemic impact at European level by having the capacity to deploy their innovative outcomes on a European scale and/or by being able to transfer them into different thematic or geographical contexts.</p><p><strong>Lot 1: Digital education (cross-sectoral)</strong></p><p>Projects under Lot 1 can address different educational sectors or bridge educational sectors, and must support high quality and inclusive digital education, in line with the Digital Education Action Plan.</p><p>Proposals under this Lot should address one of the following three priorities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Priority 1: Education technology (edTech): scaling up of EU-based solutions through cooperation and quality assurance;</li><li>Priority 2: Effective pedagogical approaches on informatics for primary and secondary level of education;</li><li>Priority 3: Teacher training and curriculum development in tackling disinformation and promoting digital literacy.</li> </ul><p>These priorities are detailed further under the ‘Setting up a project’ section below.</p><p><strong>Objectives of the Action</strong></p><p>The <strong>general objectives </strong>are as follows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovative<strong> </strong>initiatives with a strong impact on education and training reforms in specific<strong> strategic</strong> <strong>policy areas</strong>;</li><li>Contributing to the <strong>strengthening of Europe's innovation capacity</strong> by promoting innovation in education and training;</li><li><strong>Creating systemic change</strong> through fostering innovation at both practice and policy-level;</li><li><strong>Support forward-looking ideas</strong> focusing on key topics and priorities at EU level, with a clear

The COVID-19 pandemic, which has heavily impacted education and training, has accelerated the change and provided multiple new learning experiences and perspectives.</p><p>The Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 sets the EU policy for the digital transformation in education and training over the next programming period. It is a call to action for stronger cooperation at European level to learn from the COVID-19 crisis and to make education and training systems fit for the digital age. The Action Plan foresees 14 actions under two strategic priorities, namely:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Supporting the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem (1)</li><li>Addressing the need to enhance digital competences for the digital transformation (2)</li> </ul><p>Adopted by the Commission as a key enabler of the European Education Area, the Action Plan started its implementation in January 2021. In the past months, taking up the Council’s invitation and following Commission President von der Leyen’s 2021 State of the Union address, the Commission launched a Structured Dialogue with Member States on digital education and skills. The Dialogue aims to support Member States in the digital transformation of their education and training systems in an integrated, coherent and more ambitious approach, bringing together different sectors of government, as well as the private sector (e.g. EdTech companies), social partners and civil society. Through the Structured Dialogue, the Commission and the Member States will put forward a shared diagnosis on the situation and perspectives at national level; identify lessons learned and the necessary next steps for further action on digital education. The Dialogue will reach its completion at the end of 2022 and will feed future actions at EU level on digital education and skills, including two proposals for a Council Recommendation on enabling factors for digital education and on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training.</p><p>In this context, it is necessary to ensure that the adequate methodologies and teacher training opportunities are in place as to assure the effective development of digital skills and competences through education and training. Those can include the provision of informatics as a vehicle to promote the active use of technologies at young age and the development of skills and competences to address pressing societal issues, such as tackling disinformation and promoting digital literacy.</p><p>In addition to the outlined above, the Digital Education Action Plan sets out to support more effective cooperation on digital education and training at EU level through the set-up of a European Digital Education Hub. The Hub will promote cross-sectoral collaboration, identify and share good practices and support Member States and the education and training sector with tools, frameworks, guidance, technical expertise and research in the domain of digital education. The Hub should link national and regional digital education initiatives and actors and support new models for exchange of digital education content, addressing issues such as common standards, interoperability, accessibility and quality-assurance. In alignment with the objectives of the Hub, it is also important to support all actors in the digital education ecosystem to cooperate with each other effectively and in particular to facilitate the collaboration between public authorities/education and training institutions and rapidly developing sectors, such as the European Education Technology (EdTech).</p><p>Forward-Looking Projects will address one of the three following priorities:</p><p><strong>Priority 1: Education technology (EdTech): scaling up of EU-based solutions through cooperation and quality assurance</strong></p><p>The European education technology (EdTech) sector is a key source of innovation in digital education and it is growing fast. However, it remains highly fragmented, often lacking the experience and capacity to effectively cooperate with education and training institutions and public authorities in a sustainable manner.</p><p>Forward-looking projects in this priority area would involve EU-based EdTech organisations by fostering cooperation between the industry and public authorities, contributing to the development of a high-performing European digital education ecosystem.</p><p>Projects under this priority should address both:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>development of an evidence-based quality assurance framework for education technology, in cooperation with Ministries of Education, with reference to the learning outcomes achieved through the integration of education technology solutions in teaching, learning and assessment.</li><li>promoting cross-sectorial cooperation between education technology providers, education and training institutions, and public authorities in addressing efficient and equitable access to high-quality digital education content.</li> </ul><p><strong>Priority 2: Effective pedagogical approaches on informatics for primary and secondary level of education</strong></p><p>Informatics<sup><a target=_self href=#fn10 id=r10>[10]</a></sup> is still a relatively new discipline in school education. While some European countries have a long-standing tradition of teaching it, others, have only recently introduced this subject, especially in primary and lower secondary education. Recent reform processes led to changes in school curricula and to a general trend to enhance informatics at school in the EU. Yet existing evidence shows that while there is experience in teaching informatics in tertiary education and, to a certain extent, in upper secondary, the amount of knowledge and research developed in teaching at lower secondary and primary is much more limited.</p><p>Supporting the development of effective pedagogical approaches on informatics and related assessment can help in better preparing teachers to build and share expertise on how to best integrate the subject across the different levels of school education - thus better promoting young people active and safe use of digital technology.</p><p>Projects under this priority should address both:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>development and testing effective and innovative pedagogical approaches that are appropriate and with a clear progression between the different levels of education and in particular with a focus on primary and secondary level.</li><li>teacher-training initiatives aimed at increasing the availability of (generalist and specialised) teachers with adequate preparation and qualification to teach the discipline. </li> </ul><p><strong>Priority 3: Teacher training and curriculum development in tackling disinformation and promoting digital literacy</strong></p><p>As part of the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Commission has launched common guidelines for teachers and educators to promote digital literacy and tackling disinformation through education and training. Yet, more efforts at systemic level are needed to ensure that education and training systems provide effectively young people with the skills and competences to address these pressing issues and that teachers and educators are supported in their training and continuous professional development in the field.</p><p>To this end, forward looking projects on teacher training and curriculum development in promoting digital literacy and tackling disinformation would contribute to supporting education and training systems and in particular learners and teachers and educators to address new and emerging challenges in the classroom closely linked to the dynamic online environment in an effective and structured manner.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Projects under this priority should address both:Initial teacher training and continuous professional development , in the field of digital literacy and tackling disinformation both in terms of content and methodology, but also in terms of systemic uptake;</li><li>Research and exchange of effective and scalable approaches in curriculum development in the field of digital literacy and tackling disinformation.</li> </ul><p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p><p>Forward-Looking Projects intend to provide innovative solutions that can be mainstreamed at regional, national and European level and ideally with the potential to be developed further either by EU funding or else through national and regional support.</p><p>The bottom-up practices should correctly address the fixed priorities set to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity, make a strong impact on education and training reforms and initiate systemic change.</p><p>Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels, also taking national, European Industrial Ecosystems and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, Forward-Looking Projects are expected to make cathartic impact at system level to help education and training systems better meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.</p><p><strong>Award criteria</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance of the project - (maximum 30 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Link to EU policy and initiatives</strong>: the proposal establishes and develops a project that supports a forward-looking idea at EU level, taking into account and fostering existing EU tools and initiatives (if relevant).

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, , including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. In line with the European Union’s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </p>\n\"}"

The Conclusions stress the benefits of mobility of teachers and the need of embedding mobility as part of teachers’ initial and continuous education. Moreover, the Conclusions invite the Commission to support closer cooperation between teacher education providers within the continuum of teachers’ professional development.</p><p>The 2020 Commission’s Communication on Achieving the European Education Area by 2025<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/education/resources-and-tools/document-library/eea-communication-sept2020_en\"><sup>3</sup></a> recognises the key role of teachers and trainers and sets the vision of having highly competent and motivated educators who can benefit from a range of support and professional development opportunities throughout their varied careers. It proposes a number of actions to address the challenges the teaching professions face today, including the plan to launch Erasmus+ Teacher Academies.</p><p>The Commission’s Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027)<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en\"><sup>4</sup></a> stresses the need to ensure that all teachers and trainers have the confidence and competences to use technology effectively and creatively to engage and motivate their learners as well as to ensure that all learners develop their digital competences for learning, living and working in an ever more digitalised world.</p><p>The Council Resolution on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training towards the European Education Area and beyond (2021-2030) refers to the potential of Erasmus+ Teachers Academies in facilitating networking, knowledge sharing, mobility and providing teachers and trainers with learning opportunities at all phases of teachers’ and trainers’ careers.</p><p>There is a need to improve the <strong>attractiveness</strong> of the profession: in the EU countries participating in OECD’s TALIS survey, on average, less than 20% of lower secondary school teachers felt that their profession is valued by the society.</p><p>The <strong>ageing</strong> of the teaching professionals is a concern as upcoming waves of retirement could result in potential shortages in the teaching workforce in a country.</p><p>The <strong>Education and Training Monitor</strong> indicates also that a number of European countries face <strong>serious shortages</strong> of teachers, either across the board or in some subjects such as science, or in specific profiles such as teaching pupils with special needs.</p><p>Despite wide offer of continuous professional development, <strong>teachers still self-report a lack of professional development opportunities</strong> according to the OECD’s TALIS survey.</p><p>Despite the benefits of <strong>mobility</strong>, it is still not embedded in teacher education effectively, due to many practical obstacles that should be removed by more consistent policies.</p><p>The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will address these issues by promoting close cooperation between organisations active in initial and continuing teacher education and training, complement other work done in achieving the Education Area, and help transfer the results <strong>to national and regional policy making and eventually to teacher education and support for schools</strong>.</p><p>They will build on the innovations and effective practice that exists within national teacher education and European cooperation and develop them further. Specific attention will be paid to dissemination and exploitation of effective practice across countries and teacher education providers, and to ensuring feedback and impact also at policy level.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION </strong></p><p>The overall objective of this action is to create European partnerships of teacher<sup>5</sup> education and training providers to set up Teacher Academies that will develop a European and international outlook in teacher education.</p><p>These Academies will embrace multilingualism, language awareness and cultural diversity, develop teacher education in line with the EU’s priorities in education policy and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European Education Area.</p><p>The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will meet the following objectives:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Contribute to the <strong>improvement of teacher education policies and practices in Europe</strong> by <strong>creating networks and communities of practice on teacher education</strong> that bring together providers of initial teacher education (preservice education for future teachers) and providers of continuing professional development (in-service), other relevant actors such as teacher associations, ministries and stakeholders to develop and test strategies and programmes for professional learning that is effective, accessible and transferable to other contexts.</li><li>Develop and test jointly different models of <strong>mobility (virtual, physical and blended)</strong> in initial teacher education and as part of teachers’ continuous professional development in order to enhance the quality and number of mobility as well as to make mobility an integral part of teacher education provision in Europe.</li><li>Develop <strong>sustainable collaboration</strong> <strong>between teacher education providers</strong> with an impact to the quality of teacher education in Europe and with a view <strong>to inform teacher education policies at European and national levels</strong>.</li><li>Enhance the <strong>European dimension</strong> and internationalisation of teacher education through innovative and practical collaboration with teacher educators and teachers in other European countries and by sharing experiences for the further development of teacher education in Europe.</li> </ul><p>This collaboration will address one or more of the<strong> horizontal priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme</strong>, as theme(s) for the Teacher Academy activities.</p><p>Teacher Academies should identify and work on one priority or more priorities that are particularly relevant for their partnership with a view to enhancing a high-quality education/professional development, and addressing (future) teachers’ pressing needs, notably by offering teachers courses, modules and other learning opportunities on:</p><p><strong>1. Inclusion and diversity, notably:</strong></p><p>To help teachers acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for the educational inclusion of children/students with fewer opportunities, including children/students with disabilities or special needs, with a migrant background, as well as children/students living in rural and remote areas such as outermost regions, children/students facing gender inequalities, socio-economic difficulties or any other potential source of discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. This also means understanding underachievement, disengagement, and addressing well-being, mental health and bullying. Examples include: Developing competences to teach in multilingual and multicultural settings, on gender-sensitive practices, inclusive education for children with special needs, on creating supportive learning environments and strategies addressing learners’ and teachers’ well-being at school, on how to use a variety of learning approaches and blended learning, as well as formative assessment methods and tools.</p><p>To equip teachers to addressing the barriers faced by these groups in accessing education, as well as contributing to creating a positive learning climate and inclusive environments that foster equity and equality, and that are responsive to the needs of the wider community; building relationships of trust with learners, parents, families and carers; using collaborative practices and work in multi-disciplinary teams in schools.</p><p>Further references:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Council Recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education, and the European dimension of teaching<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018H0607(01)&amp;from=EN\"><sup>6</sup></a></li><li>Council Recommendation on Pathways to School Success (replacing the Council Recommendation of 28 June 2011 on policies to reduce early school leaving)<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H1209%2801%29&amp;qid=1671106078506\"><sup>7</sup></a>.</li> </ul><p><strong>2. Environment and fight against climate change, notably:</strong></p><p>To implement and further develop comprehensive and collaborative approaches to teaching and learning for the green transition and sustainable development, recognising that all teachers, whatever their discipline or sector of education, are sustainability educators who need to support their learners in preparing for the green transition.</p><p>To offer (future) teachers professional training/education about climate change and how to best teach it; develop sustainability competences of (future)teachers/educators and education leaders; and exchange and develop the approaches of the participating organisations regarding environmental sustainability.</p><p>To exchange on how to raise awareness about the green transition, environmental and climate-change challenges, to develop competences, green sectorial skills strategies and methodologies, as well as future-oriented curricula that better meet the needs of teachers.</p><p>To support teachers in adopting pedagogies, including testing innovative practices, that enhance teaching and learning for the green transition and sustainable development in interdisciplinary ways, including the socio-emotional aspects of learning, so that all learners can become agents of change and learn to reflect and act, both individually and collectively, locally and globally, for a more sustainable world.</p><p>Further reference: Council Recommendation on learning for environmental sustainability<a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9242-2022-INIT/en/pdf\"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p><p><strong>3. Addressing digital transformation through development of digital readiness, resilience and capacity, notably: </strong></p><p>To support the need to engage (future) teachers in the path to digital transformation, with a view to harness the potential of digital technologies for teaching and learning and to develop digital skills for all, also increasing the capacity and readiness of institutions to manage an effective shift towards digital education.</p><p>To contribute to the first strategic priority of the Digital Education Action Plan, the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem, by building capacity and critical understanding on how to exploit the opportunities offered by digital technologies for teaching and learning at all levels and for all sectors and to develop and implement digital transformation plans of educational institutions.</p><p>To support the purposeful use of digital technologies for teaching, learning, assessment and engagement. This includes the development of digital pedagogy and expertise in the use of digital tools for teachers, including accessible and assistive technologies and the creation and innovative use of digital education content.

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the 2021-2027 period. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding, and the successful transition to the labor market. Building on the success of the programme in the 2014-2020 period, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the number of opportunities offered to even more participants and to a wider range of organizations, focusing on the qualitative impact of the Programme and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener, and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences necessary in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensure swift recovery from crises, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, young people in particular, to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2024, the Programme will also continue the effort to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analysis, is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills, and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills, and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations, and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity, and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters, as well as their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant or face difficulties in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. </p><p>This objective can also be achieved through non-formal learning activities, which aim to enhance the skills and competences of young people and adult learners, as well as their active citizenship. The programme can contribute to enhance the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy, and thus to prevent and counter disinformation and fake news. </p><p>In line with the European Union’s priorities in making its economy sustainable, Erasmus+ projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organizations and participants involved should have an environment-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done to make projects more sustainable on their level, and help them come up with greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organizations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving, and recognizing competences acquired through formal, informal, and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas, the transmission of best practices and expertise, and the development of digital capabilities. This contributes to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories.

These partnerships should act as a first step for HEIs and organisations with a smaller operational capacity located in third countries not associated to the Programme to access and increase means to reach out to people with fewer opportunities. This Strand will finance small-scale projects to reduce the internationalisation gap among HEIs from eligible third countries not associated to the Programme, from the same country or Region. The projects that fall under this Strand will primarily focus on the following areas within third countries not associated with the Programme:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>HEIs from least developed third countries not associated to the Programme;</li><li>HEIs located in remote regions/areas of third countries not associated to the Programme;</li><li>Newcomers or less experienced HEIs and Faculties from third countries not associated to the Programme;</li><li>Students and staff with fewer opportunities.</li> </ul><p><strong><u>Overarching priorities to be covered by projects under Strand 1</u></strong></p><p>Each applicant will need to identify in Part C of the application form <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of the <strong>overarching priorities</strong>, which are defined by the European Commission per Region.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>For <strong>Regions 1 to 3</strong> <strong>sub-priorities</strong> have also been defined (see Part C of the application form). Within the overarching priority identified by the applicant, the project must choose compulsorily <strong><u>only one</u></strong> sub-priority.</li><li>For <strong>Regions 5 to 11 <u>only</u> overarching priorities</strong> exist and <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of them must be chosen by the project.</li> </ul><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions 1-3</strong></p><p><strong>Region 1: Western Balkans</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.</p><p><strong>Region 2: Neighbourhood East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research &amp; innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills &amp; jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness. Linkages with the green transition towards climate neutrality should be stressed. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote areas, including rural areas.</p><p><strong>Region 3: South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain. Particular attention is to be paid to women participation.</p><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions </strong><strong>5-11</strong></p><p><strong>Region 5a: </strong><strong>Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should respond to the growing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation in Asia and provide capacities for climate-resilient studies to provide solutions to environmental challenges in the Region. Projects should also support the green and economic transition in Asia by strengthening links with the private sector and by enhancing the knowledge and skills needed for a modern work force.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Promoting digital technologies and services will foster socio-economic development in Asia. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide in Asia by promoting and developing digital literacy and skills as well as support the digital economy and connectivity through digital education strategies.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Projects should promote mobility and in particular support the recognition of degrees and credentials in Asia, also to support intra-regional connectivity. Projects should support the integration of migrants and displaced persons through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To advance social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity such as for democratic governance, human development, and intercultural dialogue, thereby exposing the Region to European best practices in this regard.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Due to<strong> </strong>Asia’s<strong> </strong>economic dynamism, projects should support the upskilling of the young population in Asia. Projects should also help to identify education gaps that<strong> </strong>can contribute to economic growth and jobs, while exporting the EU’s sustainable growth and governance model.</p><p><strong>Region 6: Central Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The development of skills will be key to Central Asia’s competitiveness and social cohesion. Projects should promote knowledge-based economies and enhance synergies between education systems and the labour market, and should be linked with promoting digital literacy and skills.</p><p><strong>Region 7a: Middle East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should contribute to a green and sustainable economic recovery and transition as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting reforms of education systems and by strengthening links with the private sector, while also exposing higher education institutions in the Region to European practices.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Projects should support the Region’s diversification and sustainable development and address the mismatch between the education system and needs of the labour market, also providing support to team up with the private sector, to foster economies that work for all. Projects could be linked with the <em>Green Deal</em> priority by enhancing educational capacities concerning the Region’s green transition.</p><p><strong>Region 8a: Pacific</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> There is no other Region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector, as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the “blue economy” concept.</p><p><strong>Region 9: Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Contribute to a successful green and sustainable global economic recovery (including climate change, environment and energy), awareness-raising, green jobs.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Performing digital education eco-systems, improving digital skills and competences, connectivity, teacher training.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Recognition of qualifications, legal pathways, integration of migrants and displaced persons, education access, scholarships, language education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Human rights, social and economic rights, democracy, fundamental values, governance, citizenship, health, youth, gender, access and inclusion.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Skills, entrepreneurship, employability, links to the labour market and jobs creation, job opportunities, rural areas, private sector involvement.</p><p><strong>Region 10: Latin America</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Latin American countries are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable, but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons as well, through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> To accompany the Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector.</p><p><strong>Region 11: Caribbean</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.</p><p><strong><u>The indicative 2024 CBHE budget of Strand 1 per Region (in EURO)</u></strong> and the indicative number of projects to be funded are defined below.</p><p>Please note that there is a flexibility of transferring budgets between the Strands.</p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td><strong><em>Regions</em></strong></td>    <td> <p><strong><em>Indicative budget for Strand 1</em></strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong><em>Indicative n° of projects</em></strong></p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 1 Western Balkans</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>4.593.668</p> </td>    <td> <p>11</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 2 Neighbourhood East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>4.926.143</p> </td>    <td> <p>12</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 3 South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>4.104.883</p> </td>    <td> <p>10</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 5a Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>3.749.182</p> </td>    <td> <p>9</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 6 Central Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>1.043.200</p> </td>    <td> <p>2</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 7a Middle East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>720.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>1</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 8a Pacific</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>400.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>1</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 9 Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>8.210.669</p> </td>    <td> <p>20</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 10 Latin America</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>927.780</p> </td>    <td> <p>2</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 11Caribbean</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>720.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>1</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Total 2024 CBHE indicative budget of Strand 1 and indicative number of projects to be funded</strong></p> <p><strong>(national / regional)</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>29.395.525</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>69</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table>\n"

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the 2021-2027 period. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding, and the successful transition to the labor market. Building on the success of the programme in the 2014-2020 period, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the number of opportunities offered to even more participants and to a wider range of organizations, focusing on the qualitative impact of the Programme and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener, and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences necessary in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensure swift recovery from crises, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, young people in particular, to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2024, the Programme will also continue the effort to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analysis, is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills, and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills, and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations, and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity, and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters, as well as their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant or face difficulties in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. </p><p>This objective can also be achieved through non-formal learning activities, which aim to enhance the skills and competences of young people and adult learners, as well as their active citizenship. The programme can contribute to enhance the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy, and thus to prevent and counter disinformation and fake news. </p><p>In line with the European Union’s priorities in making its economy sustainable, Erasmus+ projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organizations and participants involved should have an environment-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done to make projects more sustainable on their level, and help them come up with greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organizations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving, and recognizing competences acquired through formal, informal, and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas, the transmission of best practices and expertise, and the development of digital capabilities. This contributes to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 35 years of European programmes in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, covering both the intra-European and the international partnerships dimension. </p>\n\"}"

It is expected that the proposed projects address mismatches between the requirements of employers and the offer of higher education institutions and propose integral solutions to enhance better employability of students. This can be done by implementing comprehensive interventions that include:</li><li>the design of innovative curricula and introducing innovative elements in the existing curricula;</li><li>the implementation of innovative learning and teaching methods (i.e. learner-centred and real problem-based teaching and learning);</li><li>the active engagement with the business world and with research, the organisation of continuing educational programmes and activities with and within enterprises;</li><li>the strengthening of the capacities of HEIs to network effectively in research, scientific and technological innovation.</li> </ul><p><strong>Promoting reform in HEIs</strong> to become catalysts of economic and social development. Projects should support HEIs to develop and implement the institutional reforms that will make them more democratic, inclusive, equitable, accountable and fully-fledged constituents of civil society. Institutional reforms include new governance and management systems and structures, readiness in terms of digital skills, modern university services, quality assurance processes, tools and methods for professionalisation and professional development of leadership, academic, technical and administrative staff. The development of an entrepreneurial mind-set and improved competencies and skills within the institutions are key aspects for the success of this Strand. Transversal skills learning, entrepreneurship education and the practical application of entrepreneurial skills will enable HEIs to put their knowledge and resources at the service of their local/national/regional communities.</p><p><strong><u>Overarching priorities to be covered by projects under Strand 2</u></strong></p><p>Each applicant will need to identify in Part C of the application form <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of the <strong>overarching priorities</strong>, which are defined by the European Commission per Region.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>For <strong>Regions 1 to 3</strong> <strong>sub-priorities</strong> have also been defined (see Part C of the application form). Within the overarching priority identified by the applicant, the project must choose compulsorily <strong><u>only one</u></strong> sub-priority.</li><li>For <strong>Regions 5 to 11 <u>only</u> overarching priorities</strong> exist and <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of them must be chosen by the project.</li> </ul><p><strong>Please note</strong>: The overarching priorities for Region 7 (Middle East) and Region 8 (Pacific) are applicable only for multi-national projects involving more than one Regions.</p><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions 1-3</strong></p><p><strong>Region 1: Western Balkans</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.</p><p><strong>Region 2: Neighbourhood East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research &amp; innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills &amp; jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness. Linkages with the green transition towards climate neutrality should be stressed. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote areas, including rural areas.</p><p><strong>Region 3: South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain. Particular attention is to be paid to women participation.</p><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions 5-11</strong></p><p><strong>Region 5a: </strong><strong>Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should respond to the growing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation in Asia and provide capacities for climate-resilient studies to provide solutions to environmental challenges in the Region. Projects should also support the green and economic transition in Asia by strengthening links with the private sector and by enhancing the knowledge and skills needed for a modern work force.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Promoting digital technologies and services will foster socio-economic development in Asia. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide in Asia by promoting and developing digital literacy and skills as well as support the digital economy and connectivity through digital education strategies.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Projects should promote mobility and in particular support the recognition of degrees and credentials in Asia, also to support intra-regional connectivity. Projects should support the integration of migrants and displaced persons through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To advance social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity such as for democratic governance, human development, and intercultural dialogue, thereby exposing the Region to European best practices in this regard.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Due to Asia’s<strong> </strong>economic dynamism, projects should support the upskilling of the young population in Asia. Projects should also help to identify education gaps that<strong> </strong>can contribute to economic growth and jobs, while exporting the EU’s sustainable growth and governance model.</p><p><strong>Region 6: Central Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The development of skills will be key to Central Asia’s competitiveness and social cohesion. Projects should promote knowledge-based economies and enhance synergies between education systems and the labour market, and should be linked with promoting digital literacy and skills.</p><p><strong>Region 7a: Middle East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should contribute to a green and sustainable economic recovery and transition as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting reforms of education systems and by strengthening links with the private sector, while also exposing higher education institutions in the Region to European practices.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Projects should support the Region’s diversification and sustainable development and address the mismatch between the education system and needs of the labour market, also providing support to team up with the private sector, to foster economies that work for all. Projects could be linked with the <em>Green Deal</em> priority by enhancing educational capacities concerning the Region’s green transition.</p><p><strong>Region 8a: Pacific</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> There is no other Region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector, as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the “blue economy” concept.</p><p><strong>Region 9: Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Contribute to a successful green and sustainable global economic recovery (including climate change, environment and energy), awareness-raising, green jobs.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Performing digital education eco-systems, improving digital skills and competences, connectivity, teacher training.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Recognition of qualifications, legal pathways, integration of migrants and displaced persons, education access, scholarships, language education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Human rights, social and economic rights, democracy, fundamental values, governance, citizenship, health, youth, gender, access and inclusion.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Skills, entrepreneurship, employability, links to the labour market and jobs creation, job opportunities, rural areas, private sector involvement.</p><p><strong>Region 10: Latin America</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Latin American countries are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable, but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons as well, through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> To accompany the Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector.</p><p><strong>Region 11: Caribbean</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.</p><p><strong><u>The indicative 2024 CBHE budget of Strand 2 per Region (in EURO)</u></strong> and the indicative number of projects to be funded are defined below.</p><p>In the Regions where the indicative budget is indicated as zero, normally projects in these Regions cannot be funded.</p><p>Please note that there is a flexibility of transferring budgets between the Strands.</p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong><em>Regions</em></strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong><em>Indicative budget for Strand 2</em></strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong><em>Indicative n° of projects</em></strong></p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 1 Western Balkans</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>4.320.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>5</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 2 Neighbourhood East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>5.040.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>6</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 3 South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>2.880.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>3</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 5a Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>12.240.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>15</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 6 Central Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>2.880.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>3</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 7a Middle East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 8a Pacific</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 9 Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>10.080.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>12</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 10 Latin America</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>5.940.000</p> </td>    <td> <p>7</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 11Caribbean</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>    <td> <p>0</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Total 2024 CBHE indicative budget of Strand 2 and indicative number of projects to be funded</strong></p> <p><strong>(national / regional)</strong></p> <p><strong>(national / regional)</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>43.380.000</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>51</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table>\n"

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the 2021-2027 period. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding, and the successful transition to the labor market. Building on the success of the programme in the 2014-2020 period, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the number of opportunities offered to even more participants and to a wider range of organizations, focusing on the qualitative impact of the Programme and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener, and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences necessary in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensure swift recovery from crises, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, young people in particular, to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2024, the Programme will also continue the effort to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analysis, is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills, and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills, and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations, and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity, and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters, as well as their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant or face difficulties in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. </p><p>This objective can also be achieved through non-formal learning activities, which aim to enhance the skills and competences of young people and adult learners, as well as their active citizenship. The programme can contribute to enhance the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy, and thus to prevent and counter disinformation and fake news. </p><p>In line with the European Union’s priorities in making its economy sustainable, Erasmus+ projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organizations and participants involved should have an environment-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done to make projects more sustainable on their level, and help them come up with greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organizations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving, and recognizing competences acquired through formal, informal, and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas, the transmission of best practices and expertise, and the development of digital capabilities. This contributes to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 35 years of European programmes in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, covering both the intra-European and the international partnerships dimension. </p>\n\"}"

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the 2021-2027 period. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding, and the successful transition to the labor market. Building on the success of the programme in the 2014-2020 period, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the number of opportunities offered to even more participants and to a wider range of organizations, focusing on the qualitative impact of the Programme and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener, and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences necessary in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one’s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensure swift recovery from crises, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, young people in particular, to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2024, the Programme will also continue the effort to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe’s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analysis, is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills, and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills, and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations, and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity, and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters, as well as their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant or face difficulties in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. </p><p>This objective can also be achieved through non-formal learning activities, which aim to enhance the skills and competences of young people and adult learners, as well as their active citizenship. The programme can contribute to enhance the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy, and thus to prevent and counter disinformation and fake news. </p><p>In line with the European Union’s priorities in making its economy sustainable, Erasmus+ projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organizations and participants involved should have an environment-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done to make projects more sustainable on their level, and help them come up with greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organizations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving, and recognizing competences acquired through formal, informal, and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas, the transmission of best practices and expertise, and the development of digital capabilities. This contributes to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 35 years of European programmes in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, covering both the intra-European and the international partnerships dimension. </p>\n\"}"

                    "{\"staticAdditionalInfo\":\"<p></p><p><span>Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027. Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> <span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones’ mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union </span><span>Workplan</span><span> for Sport</span><span> (2021-2024)</span><span>. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. </span><strong>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</strong><span><span> In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its </span><span>participants,</span><span> in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> Furthermore, </span><strong><span>developing digital </span><span>skills and competences</span><span> and skills in forward-looking fields</span></strong><span><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. </span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span> This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> <span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span><span> </span></span><strong>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</strong><span><span> for the European Union's future. </span><span>This issue </span><span>can also be targeted</span><span> through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> In line with the European Union’s priorities in making sustainable its economy, </span><strong><span>projects </span><span>should be designed</span><span> in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</span></strong><span><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them </span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> <span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a </span><span>high quality</span><span> education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span> The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union’s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>\n\"}"
