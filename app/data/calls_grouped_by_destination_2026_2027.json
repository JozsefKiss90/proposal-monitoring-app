      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- EU and national policymakers and relevant stakeholders get an enhanced understanding of the drivers of violence against women and LGBTIQ people who are politically active or political aspirants.\n- Enhanced prevention and early intervention through better understanding of the drivers and impacts of violence (short- and long-term) on women and LGBTIQ people engaged, or aspiring to engage, in online and offline political activities and how their participation evolves after experiencing violence and harassment.\n- Uptake of evidence-based policy recommendations by policymakers and relevant stakeholders on tackling gender-based violence alongside violence against politically active women and LGBTIQ people, promoting equal political participation and addressing harmful narratives.\n- Broader adherence to media guidelines on responsible, ethical, and safe portrayals of and reporting on gender-based violence in a political context, embedding gender-sensitive and intersectional reporting and incorporating successful practices with demonstrable, positive outcomes.\n- Promotion of an inclusive environment that encourages political participation of women, and LGBTIQ people, notably from underrepresented groups, through collaboration across key public, political and civil society actors.",
      "scope": "The increased participation and visibility of women and LGBTIQ people in public life [1] coincides with a rise in two severe forms of violence: politically motivated violence targeting public figures and gender-based violence (GBV). [2] When these two forms of violence intersect, they obstruct progress toward equality, reinforce traditional gender norms and stereotypes, power imbalances, and pose significant threats to democratic societies.\nThe EU Directive on combating violence against women acknowledges the impact of violence on women active in public life, particularly its silencing effect. The European Commission’s 2024-2029 political guidelines place the fight against GBV at the heart of the post-2025 Equality Strategy, notably to empower women in politics [3] . The Roadmap for Women’s Rights [4] recalls that women “face higher risks of threats and violence limiting their participation in public life”, while the Equality Commissioner’s Mission Letter identifies hate-motivated harassment and (online) violence as a key focus for the EU LGBTIQ equality strategy for 2026-2030. The mission letter to the Commissioner for Democracy, Justice and the Rule of Law emphasises strengthening the protection of political candidates and elected representatives facing growing threats and undue pressure.\nThis violence occurs in various forms, including sexual and physical threats and assaults, harassment, character assassinations, hate speech, disinformation campaigns exploiting misogynistic or anti-LGBTIQ narratives and deceptive image manipulation. With technological advancements, the methods of violence and harassment have moved online and become increasingly sophisticated and viral, exemplified by phenomena like cyber pile-on harassment and deepfakes. Their consequences, however, extend to the physical world, causing physical and psychological harm, as well as impacting professional and personal reputations, quality of life, and family. Proposals should, therefore, explore the wide range of impacts, including the chilling effect on victims, such as their withdrawal from social media public debates or public offices, including political ones. As situations of social, economic or political instability can exacerbate GBV and LGBTIQ-phobic violence, proposals are encouraged to explore how crises affect the nature, prevalence, and prevention of these types of violence, as well as victims’ access to support and justice.\nBoth political and media spheres, including radio, television, print, and online platforms, play a key role in shaping societal norms. Yet, coverage of GBV and cases of LGBTIQ-phobic violence are often sensationalised and biased, particularly when it involves public figures. For instance, little is known on how fictional and non-fictional narratives influence public awareness and perceptions of violence against politically active women and LGBTIQ people. Such gaps can lead to inadequate responses and support systems, while reinforcing gender stereotypes and contributing to victim blaming. Proposals should gather data on this impact and counteract sensationalism and misogyny to position media as driver of positive change. Proposals should also include analysis of the impact and potential gaps of existing EU legislation such as the Digital Services Act, and provide recommendations to policymakers.\nProposals are encouraged to explore cultural beliefs and practices, considering fields such as cinema and literature alongside social media platforms to explore how cultural representations and national context influence perceptions and responses to intersecting violence.\nIn addition, given that politically motivated violence, GBV and LGBTIQ-phobic violence intersect with various forms of discrimination, including racism [5] , proposals must consider at least three intersecting factors, such as disability, racial or ethnic background, age, religion or belief or other relevant intersecting dimensions. An intersectional lens is key to understand how the perpetration and experience of violence, including to report and access support, vary according to social, economic and identity-related characteristics of victims and perpetrators.\nA multi-country approach using quantitative and qualitative data is key. Proposals should draw on a range of relevant disciplines (including SSH), and engage stakeholders, civil society organisations and individuals directly affected by the issues in the design and implementation of research activities. Engaging men and boys in preventing violence and challenging norms should be an integral part of the research. This could include exploring how arts and humanities approaches can foster critical reflection on gender norms, violence and discrimination.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\n[1] Entails, but not limited to, public representatives, journalists, investigative reporters, human rights defenders, activists, civil society actors, political figures, and anonymous individuals engaging in the public sphere.\n[2] In this topic, political activities and being “politically active” should be understood as going beyond formal institutional structures to include a wide range of public engagement activities, such as activism, community organising, and civic participation. Moreover, the topic calls for research that goes beyond those already active in public life, by examining how violence and harassment affect the aspirations, motivations, and trajectories of girls, women, and LGBTIQ people who seek to engage in public and political spheres.\n[3] Political Guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029, https://europa.eu/!wywg4P , page 20.\n[4] COM(2025)97 - Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

      "scope": "Democratic backsliding and human rights rollbacks are increasing globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries, driven by internal instability and external interference promoting non-democratic models. These trends also represent a risk to the security of European citizens and businesses, and a destabilisation factor in the countries and regions with which the EU maintains diplomatic and economic relations. To tackle this, the EU has developed and started to implement several strategies to promote and defend democracy and human rights in third countries [3] .\nDeveloping countries with strong local democratic practices, such as elections and representative democracy at levels below the national government, tend to be more resilient against democratic backsliding. Proposals should therefore gather evidence on how actors in economic, political, and social ecosystems at the local level could foster democratic practices, increase citizens' trust in governance and democratic institutions, improve transparency of decision making, and promote respect for human rights. Proposals are also encouraged to gather evidence on different forms of democratic participation and governance at local level, paying particular attention to the inclusion of women and marginalised and underrepresented groups.\nIn countries where central governments face significant territorial challenges and lack effective control over certain areas, the EU and Member States are left to cooperate with administrations at sub-national levels. In these cases, the objectives of the research projects may be achieved through the consultation and engagement of local administrations and civil society partners. Proposals are encouraged to investigate how EU and national public authorities can operate in these fragile contexts, where central governments do not have sound control of areas of the country.\nIn addition, proposals are encouraged to investigate the link between efficient public service delivery and pro-democratic sentiment, experiences, and outcomes (measured, for example, by civic participation or trust in institutions), deliver a critical analysis of the evidence collected and identify good practices, conditions and methods for their transferability to other contexts.\nResearch activities should meaningfully involve a wide range of stakeholders and societal actors at local level (public authorities, economic and institutional actors, trade unions, traditional and faith leaders, indigenous people, women’s and LGBTIQ groups, and others), including non-scientific and non-academic actors. Proposals are encouraged to involve entities in low- and middle-income countries, to rely on their first-hand competences to steer the methodological approach and perform the data collection and analysis. Proposals are also encouraged to make use of participatory research approaches to enhance inclusivity and stakeholder engagement and experimental methods. They should adopt a multidisciplinary approach, integrating SSH fields such as political science, public administration, economics, cultural studies, sociology, gender studies, geography.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nGiven the geographical scope of this research, international cooperation is strongly encouraged. Proposals are encouraged to foster collaboration with entities in alignment with the New EU Agenda for EU-Latin America and the Caribbean, New EU Agenda for EU-Latin America and the Caribbean, EU–Central Asia Strategy, and AU–EU Innovation Agenda.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] In the context of this call “low-income and low-middle income countries” are understood as the low to middle income non-associated third countries in the list of participating countries according to the Horizon Europe rules for participation and proposal procedure.

Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\n[2] Fragile contexts refer to low- and middle-income countries or situations characterized by weak or failing institutions, limited governance, conflict or violence, economic instability, and humanitarian crises, which hinder the achievement of development goals and undermine the well-being of citizens. These contexts are often marked by a lack of transparency, accountability, and participation in decision-making processes, and may be identified through various indicators.\n[3] Such as the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020 – 2027, which is linked to the Global Gateway initiative and EU cooperation instruments linked to the Global Gateway initiative and EU cooperation instruments: https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/2024/Action-Plan-EN_2020-2027.pdf , https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/2024/Action-Plan-EN_2020-2027.pdf .

      "scope": "In an era characterized by numerous concurrent crises, accelerated technological development, and waning public trust in government, the pivotal objective of this topic is to furnish a precise depiction of the current condition of public service in MS/AC, highlight the substantial challenges governments are endeavouring to manage at the same time, the general state of the civil service and the evolution of related public employment management, including HR policy, the organizational framework conditions conducive to innovation and agile operations, and organizational development efforts. Enhancing government capacities to define strategies and develop complex public policies in a swiftly evolving context is imperative. Traditional methods are increasingly ineffective, necessitating a reinvention of government operations.\nThis investigation intends to shed light on the disruptions currently reshaping the work of governments, the complex tasks they are grappling with, their internal innovation efforts and change processes little known by the public, and to showcase the immense investment and good practices governments developed and are developing to deal with their core business in radically new ways. Governments take various paths that best suit their ambition, vision, leveraging power and the characteristics of their national context.\nProposals are expected to cover all three focus areas detailed below:\n- New governance paradigm: Focus on new governance approaches and reforms in response to declining public trust, from preparation for crisis to anticipatory governance, agile leadership, using an innovation portfolio approach to strategic planning, working with the innovation ecosystem in strategic decision-making, the impacts of digital technology (especially the role of AI, automation, the redefinition of tasks, related opportunities and threats,), open government approaches, democratic participation and central communication strategies, information flows (including social media), and related civil service development governments undertake to stand the ground today and to prepare for tomorrow.\n- Innovative approaches to public service and policy development: Solving complex issues needs multidisciplinary (including from SSH disciplines) and innovative approaches to high-quality public service and effective administrative delivery, policy- and decision making, such as citizen participation, stakeholder engagement, systems thinking, role of technology/AI and interconnected data systems and experimentation (i.e. evidence-informed policymaking).\n- New public employment management and civil service empowerment : Enabling governments to explore possibilities and transforming the civil service through innovation and public intrapreneurship, HR policy, including a public administration health-check, and capacity building (e.g. upskilling, reskilling, future literacy), the organizational framework conditions (also sensitive to the needs of the next generation of civil servants) conducive to innovation and building resilience, and cooperation with other EU governments (data exchange, mutual support) while building a modern, future-ready civil service.\nWhile national governments in the EU and Associated Countries are the primary focus for this investigation, regional and local governments as well as documented, highly inspirational good practice cases from the global context are of interest to learn from.\nThis should give voice to the civil service, examining how civil service officials (in various roles, functions and level of decision making, and in their diversity, including gender, age, socio-economic background, experience level, and other relevant personal characteristics) see the changing role of the state, their own role, organizational framework conditions (i.e. people, knowledge, ways of working, and rules and processes), how they cope under the current pressures, and what their visions, hopes and needs are for the future.\nThe research should build on existing work (data, reports, case studies, networks) by EU institutions, international organizations (World Economic Forum, OECD, United Nations, Chandler Institute of Governance, etc.), schools of governance, national governments and innovation agencies in EU Member States and Associated Countries, complemented by primary data to be collected through large-scale surveying, in-depth interviews, strategic reflection workshops covering key issues in the public governance domain (e.g. the core tasks of government, internal innovation strategies, regaining citizens’ trust, etc.), and key stakeholder engagement. The proposals should elaborate on the planned collection and analysis of the primary data (beyond desk research), and on the proposed engagement with senior officials in national government, at European level and international organizations (as relevant), demonstrating deep reach into the national civil services as key factors for the successful delivery of the work.\nProposals are encouraged to take stock of the uptake of provisions of Commission Communication COM(2023) 667 [1] , and seek complementarity with relevant EU-funded projects, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the relevant work of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52023DC0667",

      "scope": "Democracies are at risk when reliable and independent journalism is at risk. Yet, in order to be truly independent, media need sustainable financing models. At present, journalistic newsrooms are under severe economic pressure. Social media forces them to compete for citizens’ attention with other forms of infotainment, which sometimes entail unverified opinions and low-quality or malicious sources. To promote a well-informed democratic debate, citizens must be able to distinguish quality journalism abiding by professional standards, from opinion pieces and other forms of content, as free speech can thrive in ecosystems that enhance access to verified information and empower citizens to recognise it. Such ecosystems need to help distinguish sources that apply journalistic principles, including methods to ensure accuracy, independence, objectivity, impartiality, inclusivity and plural viewpoints.\nTo compete in the digital age, European media need to embrace innovation. The Commission’s 2023 European Media industry outlook [1] signalled that “an early adoption and usage of new technologies is key to adapt and open new markets”. Thus, applicants are invited to work together with news media organisations from the start to enhance innovation across the news media sectors, including by designing industrial and user-driven applications, on areas and aspects such as:\na) development and take up of methods to recognise content produced with journalistic standards (e.g. through trust indicators, browser plugins, etc.), to categorise such content (e.g. through industry-led crawlers, common taxonomies, metadata standards, etc.) and to promote such content (e.g. through inclusive and transparent news-oriented algorithms, recommender systems that show multiple views and prioritise quality information);\nb) identification of AI models that can help media build attractive services (e.g. chat bots, search tools, aggregators) and other relevant models which can generate revenues (e.g. dynamic paywalls, advertising, copyright revenues, etc.);\nc) innovative methods to ensure user-centric design and user engagement strategies, in compliance with journalistic standards;\nd) roll-out of these models and methods towards the development of truly pan-European innovative platforms and/or interoperable standards within the project lifetime;\ne) initiatives to federate media industries along a joint innovation agenda.\nInnovation projects should focus on concrete ways to help journalistic content serve democracy by addressing aspects such as:\n- ensuring that journalistic content remains economically viable in AI-intermediated information spaces;\n- ensuring that journalistic content retains relevance and prominence in AI-driven search tools and future information ecosystems in Europe;\n- ensuring that algorithms based on journalistic standards (such as accuracy and inclusion) are developed enhancing professional journalism and preserving a trustworthy information ecosystem;\n- making sure that citizens are presented with multiple views online to make well-informed decisions;\n- development and integration of journalistic trust indicators in recommender systems, browsers and/or European news aggregators;\n- take-up of recommender systems that prioritise trusted sources and professional journalism;\n- development of better digital advertising business models for news producers, through proprietary systems that offer more brand safety and sufficiently detailed feedback to advertisers through joint metadata and audience measurement tools;\n- development of EU-level business case studies, explaining their impact on creation of advertising revenues, subscription revenues, etc.;\n- development and adoption of prototypes for recommender systems, proprietary crawlers, proprietary metadata generators, paywalls, advertising systems or other revenue-generating systems that can strengthen the economic viability of journalism.\nProposals are encouraged to investigate the behavioural dimensions of news consumption, focusing on how reader habits, trust, and perceptions influence engagement with journalism. This may include examining the role of behavioural science in designing interventions (such as nudges, gamification, or educational tools) to counter misinformation and strengthen critical thinking among audiences. Proposals are also encouraged to explore the evolving trust dynamics between human-curated journalism and AI-driven news delivery, addressing how public perceptions of reliability, bias, and transparency differ across these sources.\nWhere relevant, proposals are encouraged to investigate the need for transparency and accountability mechanisms for influencers and content creators who rely on media content in their work. This may entail advocating for clear disclosure of sources, partnerships, and potential biases, as well as fostering collaboration between content creators and media actors, to amplify the visibility and credibility of reliable information sources, ensuring audiences are informed by fact-based, ethically produced content.\nProjects are encouraged to involve the relevant parts of the news media ecosystems to ensure take-up of the proposed models. All news media segments are eligible under this action (public, private media, sectoral media, etc) and collaboration across segments and across borders is encouraged. The participation in the consortia of research and academic actors from relevant disciplines, such as information science and media studies, as well as tech companies (e.g. ad-tech or other) to build workable prototypes, and SSH, is strongly encouraged. Where applicable, applicants should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.\nClustering and cooperation among the selected projects under this topic are strongly encouraged.\n[1] The European Media Industry Outlook | Shaping Europe’s digital future",

      "scope": "This call topic aims to establish a Research and Innovation Network for a Union of Equality. The proposed network should bring together academic institutions, public bodies and civil society organisations to collaborate and promote the advancement of inclusive, equal, and resilient democratic societies.\nThe proposed network should contribute to the development of a comprehensive approach to democracy, fostering a culture of participation and inclusivity, and promoting the EU values of equality, justice, and human rights. It should also address how equality and intersectionality are defined across the EU’s diverse socio-political landscapes to ensure inclusive policies that account for varying cultural and social contexts. It could also reflect on how to foster the implementation of EU strategies under the Union of Equality. [1]\nThe network should support the implementation of gender-inclusive and intersectional strategies to counter disinformation, reduce societal polarisation, and re-engage citizens in democratic practices. These efforts could also aim at promoting critical thinking, media literacy, and active civic participation across diverse groups including youth and underrepresented groups. The network could also leverage foresight to anticipate emerging challenges to democracy and inform effective policy responses. Its work should be informed by close contact with elected representatives at local, regional, national and EU levels.\nAs soon as possible in the network’s lifecycle, a dedicated online platform should be established to share evidence-based recommendations and innovative solutions to strengthen democratic practices based on Horizon Europe projects’ results and other relevant sources. This platform should be backed by a comprehensive repository that gathers information on existing tools, trainings, data, including disaggregated data, and methodologies for gender mainstreaming and addressing intersectional inequalities. It could also include a collaborative webpage for stakeholders to share information on events, calls for papers, and funding opportunities related to inclusive democracy, gender equality, and intersectionality.\nThe network should ensure and support the translation of research findings (including from SSH disciplines) into actionable, evidence-based proposals, and to enable the development of practical and effective recommendations that drive positive change at different level of actions (local, national, supranational). Living labs and innovation hubs could be used to provide a collaborative environment for stakeholders to co-create and test solutions.\nTo foster collaboration and drive progress, the network should host an annual thematic forum, providing a platform for stakeholders and policymakers to meet in person and share innovative ideas, receive feedback, and learn from one another.\nAs a research and innovation area where freedom of science is enshrined and protected, the European Union offers an ideal environment to advance a career. Therefore, the network should also explore how to ensure a safe and enabling research environment, protecting researchers from backlash, hate speech and harassment, and promoting academic freedom and integrity when researching on democracy, inclusive societies, and intersectionality.\nThe network’s actions should contribute to ensuring that the results and innovations generated by Horizon Europe projects related to inclusiveness in the public space, democracy, and governance are taken up and made available to relevant stakeholders. It could particularly build on past and on-going EU-funded projects, such as those under the topics HORIZON-CL2-2021-DEMOCRACY-01-03, HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-05; HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-05. Proposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nThe action to be funded should have a minimum duration of 4 years.\n[1] In 2020 and 2021, the Commission adopted five strategies to create the conditions for everyone to live, thrive and lead regardless of differences based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation: the LGBTIQ equality strategy 2020-2025, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025, the strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities 2021-2030, the EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025, the EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion, and participation 2020-2030.

      "scope": "Global commons—resources shared by all humanity—are increasingly threatened by overuse and degradation by state and non-state actors. Spaces beyond national jurisdiction, in particular, require collective management to ensure sustainability for future generations. Not doing so will deepen the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and possibly lead to cascading and compounding effects and crossing irreversible tipping points and planetary boundaries. Evolving geopolitical tensions, weakened multilateral cooperation, technological advances, and rising commercial interests from non-state actors, have intensified pressures on global commons. Declining trust in science further complicates efforts to agree on their fair and sustainable governance, risking instability and conflict.\nAgainst the current geopolitical background, there is a need to review the effectiveness of existing legal instruments and to accompany with research the implementation of new instruments. In addition, there is a need to further enhance the impact of existing and evolving science-policy fora [1] and their links to relevant conventions and agreements. To this end, proposals should perform a comprehensive mapping of actors’ motivations and values on societal, corporate and state level that covers different regions and coalitions of countries around the world [2] .\nResearch is also needed into how the current governance of global commons affects intergenerational justice and human rights, including gender equality and the impact on different social groups, and how civil society can be enabled to access information, provide knowledge (including Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities knowledge), and participate in the governance of global commons. This may include conducting research aimed at enhancing citizen engagement and trust in governance processes and efforts, exploring motivations and drivers underlying stakeholder positions in multilateral fora. Proposals are also encouraged to study the rights of appeal and redress in policies related to the global commons, including but not limited to the “rights of nature”.\nThe underlying question is how a sustainable governance of global commons can look like in a multipolar world with competing hegemonic powers that do not necessarily share a common understanding of the merits of cooperation, multilateralism, or even international law. Hence, the overall aim of this call is to develop multi- and interdisciplinary concepts and solutions for governing the global commons sustainably, including through the use of science diplomacy as a soft power and by learning from best practices in the different types of commons, such as the Ocean, Antarctica and Outer Space.\nProposals are encouraged to explore how imbalances in the governance of global commons may contribute to geopolitical tensions, including the outbreak of direct conflicts or proxy wars, as well as the erosion or violation of human rights. They are also encouraged to consider the wider implications of such governance gaps for international stability and the rules-based global order.\nProposals are expected to address one of the following thematic areas:\nArea A: Climate governance . Projects should consider past and current global climate governance efforts, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and develop insights for strengthening climate governance, considering the current geopolitical context. Specific attention should be given to analysing the drivers underlying the reproduction of diverging positions towards climate change among stakeholders and possible solutions as well as reinforcing the role of science-policy interfaces such as the IPCC and other relevant science-based mechanisms, e.g., through enhanced citizen engagement to increase trust. Proposals should inform and develop recommendations for EU and global science diplomacy action.\nArea B: Biodiversity governance . Projects should consider past and current global biodiversity governance efforts, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, related Conferences of the Parties and their subsidiary bodies, and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Projects are encouraged to examine in particular the integration of rights of appeal and redress in environmental decision-making processes, including legal mechanisms to address grievances and ensure accountability, particularly in the context of the “rights of nature” and other innovative approaches to environmental justice. Taking into account the current geopolitical environment, projects should develop options for reinforcing the role of science-policy interfaces such as the IPBES, IPR and other relevant science-based mechanisms, including the Global Knowledge Support Service for Biodiversity and the Subregional Technical and Scientific Cooperation Support Centres, with the aim of informing and developing recommendations for EU and global science diplomacy action. This should include a focus on enhancing access to environmental information for citizens and civil society organisations to empower biodiversity action, as well as mainstreaming gender equality and human rights considerations into biodiversity policy frameworks, in alignment with the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UN HCHR) on the development of human rights norms for biodiversity protection.\nArea C: Governance of spaces beyond national jurisdiction . Projects should provide a cross-cutting assessment of how different types of spaces beyond national jurisdiction have been governed so far, notably the ocean, polar regions, outer space including the Moon, Low Earth Orbit, the use of the radio spectrum, and dark and quiet skies. This may include a comparative review of the legal frameworks (e.g., Antarctic Treaty, UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, High Seas Treaty, Outer Space Treaty, etc.). Projects should study in a holistic, multidisciplinary manner current and emerging pressures on these spaces, with specific emphasis on the role of non-state actors and develop approaches to governing these spaces sustainably despite geopolitical fragmentation, thereby informing EU science diplomacy action. Examples of application include, and are not limited to, the protection of deep-sea ecosystems, the management of space debris, or the preservation of a dark and quiet sky.\nResearch activities should meaningfully involve experts with practical experience in the relevant processes and bodies, including policymakers, diplomats, the business sector, academia, and civil society, including indigenous rights holders. Engagement with international partners is strongly encouraged. Involvement of the EU’s outermost regions is particularly welcome for area C. Research should have a multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary systemic perspective, bringing together expertise across natural sciences and engineering as well as social sciences and humanities (including history, law, ethics, and other disciplines). The selected projects should cooperate with each other to foster synergies and links between the different governance frameworks. Proposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\n[1] Such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution (ISP-CWP), the International Resource Panel (IRP), and the International Platform for Ocean Sustainability (IPOS)\n[2] Such as the G7, G20, G77, BRICS, Small Island Developing States, etc.",

      "scope": "The aftermath of conflict poses significant challenges for rebuilding democratic institutions, promoting social dialogue, and achieving sustainable peace. In conflict and post-conflict areas, the destruction of infrastructure, institutions, and social fabric can lead to prolonged instability, increased inequalities, human suffering, and a decline in democratic governance.\nThis research aims to investigate the complex relationships between post-conflict reconstruction, democracy, inequality, and international cooperation, with the ultimate goal of promoting reconciliation, accountability, and social dialogue in conflict and post-conflict areas. By analysing the causes and consequences of conflicts, examining the role of historical narratives and cultural sensibilities, and gathering evidence on key factors such as ethnic violence, inequalities, and conflict legacies, this research seeks to inform the development of effective prevention, resolution, and reconciliation strategies. Proposals are encouraged to examine the prevention of fractured transitions in post-conflict situations, assessing past, present, and future divisions, and incorporating intergenerational and transgenerational perspectives to address potential challenges and promote a more sustainable transition.\nResearch should have an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from SSH disciplines such as contemporary historiography, sociology, psychology, legal, political science and cultural studies, to examine the complex economic, social, psychological and institutional factors that influence post-conflict rebuilding efforts.\nProposals should adopt a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, bringing together a diverse range of stakeholders, including research institutions, specialized service providers, local authorities, civil society organizations, local actors, media and information providers, schools, educational organizations, cultural institutions and heritage institutes. In addition, particular could be brought to the role of women as peacebuilders [1] .This integrative approach should combine expertise and experience in areas such as conflict resolution, democratic governance, state rebuilding and social cohesion to explore new approaches to post-conflict reconstruction.\nProposals may incorporate participatory research approaches to enhance inclusivity and stakeholder engagement, and should also examine innovative methods, such as participatory governance, inclusive economic development, and community-led reconstruction, to identify effective strategies applicable in diverse conflict and post-conflict areas.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects related to EU democracy support, civil society engagement, and international cooperation on sustainable peace and democratic governance, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.

      "scope": "The integrity of electoral processes in Europe is facing challenges in the digital age. The digital transformation of democratic processes has created new avenues for citizen engagement, but it also poses significant risks from disinformation to the integrity of electoral and other democratic processes. Concerns about foreign interference, exemplified by Russia's activities, but also other third countries, have underscored the need for robust measures to safeguard the electoral processes, including enhancing cybersecurity and voter verification to prevent perceived electoral manipulation. Social media platforms, in particular, have become increasingly critical battlegrounds in the fight for public opinion, with AI-powered tools being used to artificially amplify and spread disinformation, manipulate public discourse, and influence voter behaviour.\nTo address these challenges, it is essential to examine the effects of digital technologies on public opinion and governance, and investigate the development of ethical AI, transparent political advertising, and tools to counter misinformation, disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI). This includes exploring the potential of digital technologies to transform and improve democratic processes, investigating multi-stakeholder approaches, with particular attention in fostering dialogue with online platforms, media and political parties and movements, as well as strengthening the traditional and new media and securing alternative platforms to enhance electoral resilience.\nProposals should also investigate the risks new technologies pose to democratic integrity, particularly through the manipulation of public opinion and electoral processes, while also exploring ways to leverage these new technologies to better understand and mitigate these threats. Proposals are also encouraged to examine how AI-generated content across media, including entertainment media, influence public opinion, social narratives, gender stereotypes and norms, and civic engagement. Moreover, proposals may consider strategies for the implementation of appropriate cryptographic measures, including the investigation of approaches based on post-quantum cryptography.\nThe EU institutions have been actively engaged in addressing the key challenges for election integrity, including the artificial amplification of disinformation, online platform accountability, and the protection of democratic processes. Proposals should take into account ongoing political and strategic initiatives, notably the Political Advertising Regulation, the AI Act, the Digital Services Act (DSA) election guidelines [1] and the Commission’s 2023 Recommendation on inclusive and resilient elections, and Code of Conduct on Disinformation [2] .\nThe ultimate goal is to understand how to create robust and resilient electoral systems that can meet the challenges of the digital age, ensure the safety and integrity of electoral processes, and promote free, fair, inclusive, accessible and transparent elections. This requires investigating the risks of cyberattacks and foreign interference on electoral processes, developing strategies to enhance voting system security and promote election transparency, developing early warning systems, effective debunking strategies, and accountability measures for platforms.\nResearch should have an interdisciplinary approach (including SSH disciplines), bringing together a diverse range of stakeholders, including – but not limited to - electoral authorities and other national authorities with responsibilities in electoral matters – notably those represented in the European Cooperation Network on elections – civil society organisations, new and traditional media and digital platforms.\nProjects may also focus on how FIMI can influence political discourse via digital platforms, particularly during electoral periods, including in ways that undermine the rights of women, LGBTIQ people, persons with disabilities and other underrepresented groups. This also involves examining the safety of electoral processes, protecting the integrity of elections, and maintaining public trust in the democratic process, with a particular focus on ensuring the safety and security of political candidates, especially women and LGBTIQ people and other members of minority groups, from violence, intimidation, and harassment. Addressing these concerns requires a comprehensive understanding of how AI shapes political campaigns, media narratives, public engagement, and the spread of (gendered) disinformation.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other EU-funded projects related to electoral integrity under the Horizon Europe programme (including but not limited to those in the fields of cybersecurity and research and development of AI), and complementary funding schemes, such as the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme and the Digital Europe Programme, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nApplicants may consider the participation of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to leverage its broad range of scientific and technical capabilities, including its expertise in digital technologies, data science, and cybersecurity, to support the projects’ objectives and enhance their overall impact.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1707\n[2] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/code-conduct-disinformation",

      "scope": "A healthy democracy relies on citizens being able to make informed democratic choices, in free and fair elections. Meaningful and inclusive citizens’ participation and engagement can further complement and reinforce representative democracies and foster trust in public institutions. Education plays a major role in supporting active interest in democratic participation and citizen engagement. Accessible education in matters of democracy and participation in public-policy making is a lifelong process that concerns all age groups in society regardless of their educational and socio-economic backgrounds.\nLifelong learning about democratic processes, civic rights and obligations is crucial. It is a long process that concerns not only young people but also older ones. A healthy democracy relies on meaningful, inclusive engagement from citizens across all ages and demographic groups on a continuous basis. It is important to sustain lifelong civic participation, as technological, geopolitical and economic changes pose new challenges to social cohesion and the equal participation of all citizens in democratic processes.\nThe focus of this topic is on how citizenship education as part of lifelong learning can boost citizens’ democratic involvement and civic engagement. Research should look at how vocational education and training (VET) (e.g. at secondary and post-secondary levels), including apprenticeships, or adult education programmes, can raise civic knowledge, political awareness, and attachment to democratic values, such as respect for human dignity, freedom, equality and the rule of law. Projects should examine either VET or adult education programmes. Research should further investigate how involvement in these programmes is linked to increased civic participation actions like voting or standing as a candidate in elections, engaging in public policy-making processes, or broader democratic participation such as volunteering or engaging with civil society organisations.\nResearch could also explore how VET or adult learning programmes could support citizens including persons with disabilities, in enhancing their digital and media literacy skills, and navigating and understanding the rapidly changing democratic information ecosystem, for example by being able to recognise disinformation and make use of digital tools for democratic engagement.\nResearch should test and pilot innovative methods and curricula to develop citizenship awareness for VET or adult education teachers and students.\nA gender and intersectional perspective should be systematically integrated throughout the research, as well as the perspective of other groups that are marginalised, underrepresented in political decision-making, face barriers due to accessibility issues, or are at risk of disengagement.\nResearch may also examine digital and media literacy to foster critical thinking, to shape and develop citizens’ media and other competencies of citizens, and make recommendations for best practices in this area. Proposals may also examine democratic participation among ageing populations for whom digital tools are a barrier and propose recommendations for solutions to improve their participation. While digital tools can support engagement, research may also examine non-digital, person-to-person approaches that support participation, including in an inter-generational setting.\nProposals should seek collaboration with the European Partnership on Social Transformations and Resilience.\n[1] The Action plan on basic skills (March 2025) explicitly recognises citizenship as a basic skill, and it defines it as: “The ability to act responsibly and participate fully in civic life, grounded in an understanding of social, economic, legal and political structures. This involves understanding and evaluation of civic and democratic concepts, institutions and processes, including democracy, media literacy, crisis preparedness and respect for others and freedom of speech.”",

      "scope": "As recalled by the “Safer together” report [1] , “over the past years, the Commission has already taken steps to counter hybrid threats (including foreign information manipulation and interference/FIMI) and enhance democratic resilience across the EU. It adopted, among other initiatives, the European Democracy Action Plan [2] to build more resilient democracies across the EU by promoting free and fair elections, strengthening media freedom, countering disinformation and FIMI and promoting information integrity. With the adoption of the Digital Services Act [3] (DSA) and its binding obligations for online platforms to combat the spread of disinformation, the Commission also strengthened the Code of Practice on Disinformation, which became a Code of Conduct within the framework of the DSA. Moreover, the launch of the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) and its hubs increased the capacity to detect, analyse and expose disinformation campaigns.” [4]\nThe Preparedness Union Strategy [5] underlines how preparedness is a collective responsibility. It also points at the need to make our democracies more resilient, in particular in view of strengthening trust in institutions, which can be crucial in crisis situations as seen for instance during the COVID pandemic. Groups in a vulnerable situation in particular, such as children, senior citizens and persons with disabilities, ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTIQ people, those suffering poverty and/or social exclusion, are disproportionately affected by crises, often exacerbating pre-existing disadvantages, barriers and inequalities.\nDisinformation is particularly harmful as it undermines public confidence and can exacerbate the impact of crises. Engaged, informed and empowered citizens are the best guarantee for the resilience of our democracies. Public authorities, schools, universities and training institutions, youth initiatives, civil society organisations and associations, social partners, businesses, local networks and communities, and citizens from an early age, all play a vital role in such collective endeavour, and the proposed research should take a multi-actor approach.\nAgainst this background, the proposed research should explore the complex and dynamic patterns of user behaviours in the digital age, investigating how individuals seek, evaluate, and engage with information online, and offline. Such an exploration will benefit from including an analysis of the emotional dynamics in the dissemination of disinformation and polarization on digital platforms. This is especially relevant in crisis contexts in which foreign information manipulation and disinformation can be leveraged to increase panic and confusion. Proposals should investigate how algorithms amplify emotive content, fostering polarization and undermining trust in democratic institutions, as well as crisis response and develop digital and media literacy strategies to counter emotionally manipulative narratives, such as populist and post-truth discourses.\nThe research should also examine the factors that influence digital literacy, information-seeking habits, and online engagement, with a focus on improving citizen’s’ participation and engagement through digital means (including through civic tech) and informed decision-making. At a time when disinformation is used to sow discord by exploiting the fears of citizens, it is crucial to ensure that democratic decisions are informed by the most reliable and widely accepted facts and sources of information available. Research should explore the critical role digital and media literacy can play in fostering societal resilience and information integrity, by allowing citizens to navigate and resist misinformation and disinformation.\nProposals should plan a critical assessment of media and digital literacy initiatives [6] to assess whether existing efforts are enhancing citizens’ resilience, or whether new approaches are needed to more effectively equip citizens against evolving manipulation tactics.\nResearch should identify strategies to improve media literacy and digital and media literacy, in order to enhance critical thinking, promote evidence-based decision-making, and counter the negative impacts of disinformation on democratic societies. To facilitate the generation of practical solutions for educators and policymakers, the research could utilise computational tools, such as Social Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing, to map and mitigate the dissemination of disinformation across multiple platforms. This includes identifying Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour and analysing both textual and visual content to inform media literacy initiatives.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects related to media and digital literacy, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nThe projects selected for funding are encouraged to collaborate with the JRC to seek synergies with its work on innovation for democracy and public governance.\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/topics/defence/safer-together-path-towards-fully-prepared-union_en\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250\n[3] https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en\n[4] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-digital-media-observatory\n[5] Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the European Preparedness Union Strategy\n[6] For instance, “Guidelines for teachers and educators on tackling disinformation and promoting digital literacy through education and training”, Publications Office of the European Union, 2022, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2766/28248 ; or the UNESCO’s “Global Standards for Media and Information Literacy Curricula Development Guidelines”",

Guidance, toolkits, and actionable methodologies are developed to promote these collaborations, providing policymakers, professionals, and training organisations with clarity on intervention scope, applicability across various fields, and evaluation methods, metrics, or tools.\n- New and existing national, European or international networks for art-science-technology collaborations are established or strengthened, expanding opportunities for artists to engage with science and technology.\nFocus 1\nApproaches, methodologies and model interventions for integrating arts and creative practices to enhance soft skills across public and private sectors are developed, tested and disseminated.\nFocus 2\nThe effectiveness of critical artists’ engagement in interdisciplinary teams is demonstrated alongside the assessment of the viability of research-intensive emerging technologies through at least three low technology readiness level (TRL) pilot demonstrators.",
      "scope": "Artistic research fosters inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary thinking, inspiring innovative problem-solving and offering new avenues for innovation across policy areas, akin to scientific research. EU initiatives such as SciArt and S+T+ARTS [1] show that art-science-technology collaborations enhance scientific and technological progress. Art acts as a catalyst for innovation, developing creative solutions to complex challenges and brings fresh perspectives to the scientific community. Artistic research is increasingly fostering mutual fertilization between the arts and academia. Collaboration with artists leads academics to adopt experimental practices, while artists increasingly engage with theoretical aspects of their practice. Closer collaboration between artists and companies in emerging technologies ensures that technological developments are guided by diverse, human-centred perspectives. Artistic research offers cross-disciplinary insights that challenge conventional thinking, spark innovation beyond technical efficiency, and address societal challenges holistically. Furthermore, artistic intelligence [2] makes complex concepts accessible and engages audiences emotionally and culturally. Artistic expression facilitates the adoption of innovative concepts and practices and catalyses social innovation, supporting sustainable and inclusive societal transformations and the cultural uptake of socio-scientific issues. Now is the time to consolidate understanding of the transformative potential of art-science-technology collaborations, distil it for application across policy areas and levels, and develop methods to evaluate their impact both quantitatively and qualitatively. Projects are expected to:\n- Gather evidence on art-science-technology collaborations for addressing societal challenges and spurring innovation in science and technology.\n- Collect case studies, produce and disseminate guidance, toolkits, and methodologies supporting policymakers in promoting these collaborations and strategies for cross-disciplinary innovation. Mechanisms, span of possible interventions, applicability to diverse fields and contexts will be clarified and exemplified.\n- Develop concrete use cases, such as (but not limited to): artists supporting ethical, inclusive, human-centred AI; addressing societal challenges and complex transformations through art-science-technology collaboration, advancing emotional storytelling, experiential art and public engagement through AI and real-time data; public sector roles in the art-science-technology uptake; role of artists in catalysing innovation in policymaking; participatory art-science-technology initiatives and citizen science.\n- Develop and test qualitative and quantitative methodologies and key performance indicators for evaluating such interventions, assessing their impacts, measuring their medium to long-term benefits and identifying what constitutes success.\n- Increase opportunities for artists to engage in art-science-technology collaborations, through network establishment or consolidation, interdisciplinary initiatives or other methods.\nProject consortia should include artists and creatives/representatives of creative industries. Through leveraging creativity, projects should boost EU productivity and competitiveness while improving artists and creative professionals' employment conditions and preserving the autonomy and freedom essential to artistic practice and democratic society.\nFinancial support to third parties of up to EUR 60.000 in the form of grants may be considered, with the aim of actively engaging artists and creative professionals, for example through residencies, to facilitate development of solutions and innovative experimentations.\nIn addition to the main focus area, proposals should choose between the following two focuses:\nFocus 1. Enhancing soft skills through creativity and the arts\nPolicies and strategies for introducing creative thinking and cross- and transdisciplinary methods in education, research and the broader public and private sectors are needed. In the workforce, engaging with creative practices and the arts enhances soft skills -such as creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, emotional intelligence - crucial for productivity and competitiveness in an increasingly automated world [3] and to meet the demands of a changing market. Supporting research and innovation in this area will help individuals and institutions develop the skills and mindsets needed to thrive and increase creativity, productivity and well-being, including mental health, in a complex, interconnected society. Projects are expected to develop, experiment, and disseminate frameworks for using the arts and creative practices to strengthen soft skills in various public and private sectors, including education and lifelong learning, public administration and corporate environments, and showcase best practices. Proposals may choose their own areas of application.\nFocus 2. Pilots on emerging technologies\nProposals should develop at least 3 small scale pilots on emerging technologies in interdisciplinary settings involving artists, to assess, demonstrate and streamline research-intensive technologies. Candidate technologies could include, among others, immersive arts, grid sensing networks, multisensuality, ubiquitous XR, spatial computing, VLM/LLM and historical data, crowd digitization or virtual reality. Pilots should demonstrate the effectiveness of artists’ engagement.\nProposals should clearly indicate the focus they have selected.\nProposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) based on its experience, in particular with the SciArt programme, and with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and policymaking.\n[1] For information on these initiatives, see https://science-art-society.ec.europa.eu/front and https://starts.eu/\n[2] In the context of this topic, artistic intelligence can be understood as the collaborative capacity of artistic research and practice to generate and drive innovation, impact, and value by integrating creativity with scientific, technological, and cultural knowledge, particularly through cross-disciplinary collaboration, as demonstrated in initiatives such as STARTS and SciArt. Proposals can critically explore and develop the definition.\n[3] M. Draghi (2024), The future of European competitiveness. Part B: In-depth analysis and recommendations, p. 258, 272.",

      "scope": "The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) count a high rate of startups. Data indicate that CCIs are among the early adopters of new technologies, especially in the digital realm. For instance, the European Monitor of Industrial Ecosystems (2024) [4] notes that artificial intelligence-based technology startups were most common among the CCIs and in the health sector. Furthermore, creative startups drive innovation through crossovers with other sectors. They can be a motor of growth in local economies, unlocking opportunities, investment, jobs and higher productivity. That is why a host of initiatives like creative clusters, innovation hubs, smart specialisation strategies, innovation ecosystems, etc. foster the emergence of creative startups. Also at EU level, there are a number of initiatives to support startups and/or cultural and creative industries [5] , and there is a clearly stated ambition to make EU the preferred choice for startups and scaleups, as expressed in the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy [6] .\nHowever, in order to better support European creative startups to grow into scaleups and to multiply their potential as high-impact disruptive innovators, in line with the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy, additional measures are needed.\nThe challenge is to deepen the knowledge of the most important factors that favour the scaling up of creative startups in Europe and unleashing their potential for disruptive innovation, with a particular focus on those factors that distinguish them from startups in other sectors.\nProposals are expected to focus either on:\nOption a : Boosting the growth of creative startups into scaleups.\nOption b : Boosting creative startups or scaleups with a potential for disruptive innovation.\nProposals should clearly indicate the option they have selected.\nApproaches should be devised that boost the growth of creative startups in Europe and/or encourage engaging in disruptive innovation. Approaches developed may build on existing methods, such as shared technological resources/platforms to lower investments needs, credible assessments of technologies, IPR or of creative companies to increase investor readiness, matchmaking platforms, etc. However, the approaches to be developed under this action should be innovative and go beyond the existing ones. They should be effective and feasible across Europe under the current legal framework.\nIn order to validate and refine the proposed approaches, projects should carry out at least 3 pilot trials in different settings under real-world like conditions. These should involve piloting the scaling-up of a creative startup or positioning a creative startup/scaleup for bringing disruptive innovation to the market, according to the option chosen (a or b above). Financial support to third parties may be considered, with the aim of engaging diverse innovative creative startups, facilitating the uptake of solutions devised by the projects, experimenting with innovative approaches, or engaging other funders in co-financing.\nTo the extent appropriate, projects should build on and take advantage of previous research, networks, policy initiatives and infrastructure at European and national levels. This may include building on results of or structures developed by relevant R&I projects funded under Horizon Europe or other EU funding programmes that focus on boosting the innovation potential of CCIs, the EIT Knowledge and Innovation Community ‘EIT Culture and Creativity’ [7] , or other relevant projects and networks. Such existing networks and infrastructures may also include business incubators or accelerators, venture capital networks [8] , etc.\nTo the extent appropriate, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish coordination mechanisms in order to achieve the strongest possible common impact. One such area of cooperation could be communication and dissemination efforts.\nThe Commission estimates that a project duration of at least 4 years is appropriate, in order to be able to achieve the expected outcomes.\n[1] In the context of this topic, a ‘creative startup’ should be understood as a private company that falls under the definition of cultural and creative industries as defined in the European Parliament Resolution ‘A coherent EU policy for cultural and creative industries’ ( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016IP0486&from=EN ), is younger than ten years and has an innovative product and/or service and/or business model that it aims to scale up.\n[2] In the context of this topic, ‘disruptive innovation’ should be understood in the sense used by the European Innovation Council, but with no requirement to be based on deep tech; as an innovation which radically changes the way of operation (‘of doing things’), and therefore creates new market(s) or has a significant impact on current markets, on economic activity of firms and/or on the public sector or society at large.\n[3] The definition of scaleups by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) requires that a company grows at an annual rate of 20% or more over three consecutive years in terms of number of employees or turnover. In the context of this call topic, such growth rate in one year / 2 consecutive years is sufficient.\n[4] SWD(2024) 77 final https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52024SC0077\n[5] E.g. the EIT Culture & Creativity KIC , Cultural and Creative Regional Ecosystems , Digital Innovation Hubs in the cultural and creative sectors , Creative Innovation Labs\n[6] See further COM(2025) 270 https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/2f76a0df-b09b-47c2-949c-800c30e4c530_en\n[7] https://eit-culture-creativity.eu/\n[8] Such as for instance https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-fund/trusted-investors-network_en",

      "scope": "AI technologies are transformative, providing unprecedented opportunities for human creativity, experimentations and co-creations. AI profoundly impacts cultural and creative sectors and industries, changing practices, facilitating new ways of working and making innovative services and products possible. Artists, industry players, and cultural organisations increasingly use AI, for assistance in content creation, production, and management, to predict trends, personalise market content, engage audiences, enhance cultural heritage preservation and accessibility, and many more purposes.\nCultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI) [1] need to fully harness AI's potential to maintain relevance, expand their impact and value, increase competitiveness, and keep their vibrant, inclusive nature. Embracing and co-creating ethical AI solutions tailored to CCSI needs will, among other benefits, enable the automation of low-creativity tasks, allowing to increase focus on high-value activities that enhance creativity and productivity, thus unlocking unprecedented possibilities. Production times and costs can be reduced, market reach expanded, preservation, interpretation and inclusive access to cultural heritage enhanced, and new job categories could emerge.\nAlthough several initiatives are on the ground, a comprehensive understanding of enabling frameworks and factors and of what is still lacking in terms of data, standards, infrastructures, computing power, tools, knowledge and capacity for the CCSI to fully embrace the opportunities opened by AI is essential for effectively integrating AI technologies into CCSI practices and workflows. Proposals should assess the current level of AI readiness in the CCSI, investigate the specific barriers to AI adoption in the sectors, and highlight areas where AI can offer the most benefits. In continuous engagement with the sectors, based on the analysis of current practices and through concrete use cases, proposals should produce strategic guidance to extensively and seamlessly integrate AI into CCSI operations, enhancing efficiencies, averting risks, and facilitating cross-sector collaboration. Based on this analysis, they should develop a set of tailored tools designed to address the specific gaps and leverage the opportunities uncovered during the assessment. These tools should be strategically aligned with the sector's needs, ensuring they provide targeted solutions to enhance AI adoption and maximize its potential benefits. They should be scalable, affordable for smaller, less-resourced CCSI actors and accompanied by related documentation and training materials and documentation.\nProposals should address one of the following two options, and are allowed to address both:\n- Develop scalable pilots for innovative AI-enabled products and services across diverse segments of sectoral value chains, in cooperation with CCSI. These pilots are expected to address identified gaps in CCSI operations and prioritise solutions that catalyse innovation in sectors whose business models are not yet taking full advantage of AI. Applicants should have flexibility to select their preferred application areas.\n- Design and pilot innovative, inclusive, ethically driven, transparent AI solutions to foster cultural and linguistic diversity, and enhance accessibility, with a focus on engaging individuals in vulnerable situations, particularly youth, older people, persons with disabilities and individuals with special needs. Applicants should have the flexibility to select their preferred application areas.\nPilots should aim at leveraging AI for facilitating new revenue streams for the CCSI, as well as sustainable business models, and will highlight marketable solutions.\nFinancial support to third parties may be foreseen, with the aim of engaging entities external to the consortium in the development of pilots.\nConsortia should include representatives of the cultural and creative sectors and industries and technology developers.\nProposals should consider relevant policy initiatives, such as the AI Continent Action Plan [2] , and build upon existing research and innovation outcomes, particularly insights and resources from Horizon Europe-funded projects focused on digital transformation, innovation, or competitiveness in the CCSI, and science-technology-art collaboration, and should liaise with the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity. Whenever relevant, they might make use of existing facilities and platforms such as the European High-Performance-Computing network, the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, ALT EDIC and other data spaces, European Digital Innovation Hubs, AI Factories, and relevant research infrastructures.\n[1] “CCSI relate to all sectors and industries whose activities are based on cultural values, cultural diversity and individual and/or collective artistic and other creative expressions, whether those activities are market or non-market oriented, whatever the type of structure that carries them out, and irrespective of how that structure is financed. Those activities include the development of skills and talent with the potential to generate innovation, the creation of wealth and jobs through the production of social and economic value, including from intellectual property management. Those activities relate also to the development, the production, the creation, the dissemination and the preservation of goods and services which embody cultural, artistic or other creative expressions, as well as related function s such as education and management.

Particular attention should be paid to rights and remuneration of creators, diversity of cultural expression, audience perception, consumption patterns, market dynamics, value chains, royalty allocation and the effectiveness of copyright infrastructure.\n- Scenarios, value chains, standards and robust, agile solutions to ensure transparency and trust in the generative AI supply chain are developed, aiming for a fair and transparent market for cultural and creative content. This includes: systems for content provenance detection of AI-generated and manipulated creative content; tools and infrastructure that reinforce rights management, creators’ consent, control, and fair compensation for the use of their works in AI training and generation; measures supporting the findability and discoverability of trustworthy cultural and creative content; mechanisms for the long-term preservation and stewardship of AI-generated creative works.\n- Adaptive policy frameworks, recommendations, and solutions that embed cultural and ethical considerations in AI development for/with CCSI. These should ensure a fair and ethical market for cultural and creative content, products and services. Concrete solutions to address identified challenges and ensure equitable and sustainable creative economies, including agile mechanisms to ensure equitable value distribution, are proposed.\n- A systemic innovation framework for sustainable CCSI is developed and validated. It enables agile experimentation, design, and testing of future-proof business models, that support compliance with ethical standards, legal requirements, and resource-efficient practices adaptable to market and technological changes.",
      "scope": "The impact of generative AI on the CCSI and society is complex and multifaceted [1] . While it offers new possibilities, it also raises concerns, particularly regarding copyright, revenue models, employment patterns, and audience engagement. Understanding these socio-economic impacts, including how AI shifts the way the arts and culture are understood, created, practiced, and learnt, is crucial.\nGenerative AI can produce outputs potentially competing with human-created content. AI can also facilitate the manipulation of creative works, potentially infringing copyright or misleading users. Increasing transparency of AI generated or manipulated content may help to distinguish between human-created and machine-generated content and inform new practices for content dissemination and consumption.\nChallenges related to the availability of quality data for AI applications and to the accuracy and reliability of cultural content should be investigated and addressed. In particular, the development of Generative AI technologies requires access to vast amounts of content that is often still protected by copyright. One of the challenges in this context is linked to the difficulty to identify copyrighted works, rightsholders and information on how their works may be used. The purpose of the insights gained is to inform novel practices for managing AI-generated content in cultural and creative fields, including the preservation of valuable outputs, such as artworks created by using AI, and to inform the establishment of adequate policy and legal frameworks and infrastructures.\nProposals should primarily address the following dimensions:\n- Investigate and identify emerging trends, including through scenario analysis, and estimate the economic and social implications and impact of AI-generated outputs on the creative content market and related services, and on different actors and sectors, with a special focus on creators’ rights, earnings, allocation of royalties, as well as on diversity, inclusion, consumption and user perception of cultural products and services.\n- Examine and propose policy and legal frameworks to ensure a sustainable and innovative creative sector in the age of AI.\n- Propose standards and robust solutions to map the generative-AI supply chain, identify, trace and find trusted content, and ensure authenticity; tools for strengthening consent, control, rights management and compensation for the use of artistic and creative data in AI; suggest other measures to ensure a fair and transparent market for cultural and creative content, including solutions to increase the discoverability of trustworthy cultural and creative content, including copyright protected content that could be used for the AI training.\n- Investigate new, efficient ways to redefine value creation and transformed business models. This includes looking at uncovering opportunities that support human creation, and increase profitability, while providing frameworks for the distribution of AI-generated and/or assisted creative content, and measures for long term preservation of valuable works created with the use of AI.\n- Systemic and agile innovation: propose a validated framework to experiment, design, prototype and test new business models that can adapt to a rapidly evolving market, are resource efficient, and comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks.\nBy integrating these findings and insights, risks associated with generative AI can be mitigated and new positive prospects developed. Insights gained are expected to contribute to the EU’s global leadership in creativity and innovation.\nProposals should consider relevant policy initiatives, such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the envisaged AI dedicated strategy for the cultural and creative sectors [2] , and build upon existing research and innovation outcomes. Proposals selected under this call should collaborate and, if relevant, build upon the research developed by projects retained under call HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-04.\n[1] See, among others, JRC’s Generative AI Outlook Report - Exploring the Intersection of Technology, Society and Policy ,2025.\n[2] Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions” AI Continent Action Plan” COM (2025) 165 final https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ai-continent-action-plan .

      "scope": "This topic explores how international partnerships can strengthen cultural policies and creative industries innovation, promote cross-cultural collaboration, and support sustainable development and global relations. Proposals should examine innovative approaches that benefit partners worldwide while enhancing Europe's global standing through cultural cooperation. The topic has two distinct but interconnected focuses; proposals should select one but may also consider complementarities and synergies with the other.\nFocus 1: Cultural and creative industries’ innovation beyond borders\nCreative industries are gaining global attention for their multifaceted impact on economies and societies, driving economic growth, job creation, opportunities for youth, women, and persons with disabilities, while generating value and fostering wellbeing across regions. By investing in digital and green transitions, adopting ethical and open AI, and leveraging cultural heritage, the EU offers a compelling paradigm for creative industries worldwide. This approach strengthens creativity within Europe and can inspire other regions developing their own cultural and creative economies, contributing to a flourishing global creative ecosystem. Creative industries support resilient, inclusive, balanced and mutually respectful partnerships that create new markets and drive innovation, advancing a global Europe. There is a growing need to explore diverse approaches to promoting cultural and creative industries, fostering knowledge exchange and mutual learning to amplify positive impacts worldwide, with Africa, the Far East, South-East Asia, Latin America being particularly promising regions for cooperation. Proposals should establish pilot projects to demonstrate the potential of cross-regional cooperation in creative industries, addressing specific regional challenges and opportunities. They may leverage the EU Global Gateway strategy to foster resilient, inclusive, and innovative global partnerships.\nFocus 2: International cultural relations for global resilience\nWhile often used interchangeably, cultural diplomacy, international cultural relations, and soft power each reflect different layers of collaboration and competition: cultural diplomacy often advance national interests through cultural exchange, international cultural relations emphasise mutual and reciprocal engagement, and soft power highlights the subtle influence of culture and creativity in shaping global perceptions.\nAs traditional diplomatic channels face pressures, these approaches have become vital for enhancing mutual understanding, building trust, and fostering dialogue and cooperation across borders—even amid political disagreements. They promote societal resilience and peaceful coexistence by highlighting common values, easing tensions, and bridging divides. International cultural relations also offer opportunities to strengthen existing partnerships or forge new ones—important also for Europe’s own strategic autonomy—by leveraging shared values, cooperation mechanisms, existing networks (including the EU Global Gateway), and diverse cultural diplomacy strategies in today’s geopolitical landscape.\nProposals under this focus should establish pilot projects to test innovative forms of international cultural relations, such as initiatives fostering intercultural dialogue among communities experiencing tension or affected by conflict; collaborative artistic projects promoting mutual understanding and countering nationalism, xenophobia or conflict; cultural partnerships that avoid asymmetric power dynamics; or joint activities demonstrating how culture can strengthen societal resilience through inclusion, diversity, openness and how arts, design and cultural practices contribute to social cohesion. Africa, the Far East, South-East Asia, Latin America are regions of particular interest for this focus area as well. Proposals should clearly indicate the focus they have selected.\nProjects should establish mechanisms for ongoing collaboration that leverage each region's cultural assets and industry innovations to address global and local challenges\nProposals addressing either focus may also explore ways to address unequal access to global markets and imbalances in partnerships within the creative economy, with attention to gender and other intersectional aspects shaping opportunities and participation. Research organisations, policy think-tanks, creative industries representatives, artist organisations/artists, tech communities, and cultural organisations from Europe and partner world regions are encouraged to participate.\nProposals should involve CCSI representatives from the outset to ensure their central role. Proposals need not cover all CCSI but may focus on a specific area for in-depth analysis to develop a strong knowledge base and highlight strategic directions and routes to improvement. Proposals should explore synergies with other EU programmes supporting international cultural and creative partnerships, including the European Spaces of Culture, [1] and may seek complementarities with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-07. In order to achieve the topic’s expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] Among others: Cultural Relations Platform , connecting cultural practitioners worldwide; S+T+Arts4Africa digital innovation in African sub-Saharan culture and digital innovation hubs; Africa-Europe Partnerships for Culture , focusing on artistic co-creation and cooperation; European Spaces of Culture: innovative collaboration models in cultural relations between EU and extra-EU local partner organisations; Creative Africa: Audiovisual for cross-border cooperation in the audio-visual sector across the entire value chain; Strengthening African-European Museum Partnerships: an African-European museums platform to develop a new multilateral framework based on co-creation; CreatiFI: Financial instrument to support creative industries; ACP-EU Culture: assist the socio-economic development of the ACP countries by supporting their cultural and creative sectors; ProCultura: contribute to the increase of employment and income-generating activities in the cultural and creative sector of the Portuguese-speaking African countries and East Timor; EU-UNESCO Facility : technical assistance to support cultural policy strengthening and the implementation of the UNESCO 2030 Culture Indicators, the framework to measure and assess culture’s contribution to sustainable development; Transcultura: deepen integration within the Caribbean region and strengthening people-to-people cooperation with the European Union.",

Non-linguistic benefits of language maintenance and revitalisation are well documented, communicated and understood by different stakeholders.\n- Citizens are empowered and engaged in the sustainable management of their own linguistic heritage and resources, with a focus on intergenerational dialogue and education activities, with particular attention to communities where oral transmission is the primary mode of language preservation.\n- Maps and visual presentations showing the linguistic diversity in Europe are available, including a variety of existing languages (regional and minority languages, indigenous languages, low resources languages etc.) and offering suited terminology and explanations.",
      "scope": "Linguistic diversity is a fundamental part of Europe’s cultural heritage. When languages disappear, a whole knowledge system disappears, and cultural diversity is impoverished. Linguistic diversity plays a key role in safeguarding cultural diversity. Languages are the expression of the identity, culture and the way peoples perceive their world. Knowledge and culture are lost when languages are lost.\nThe EU has 24 official languages and some estimated 60 other languages spoken in particular regions or by specific groups. They are an essential part of the rich fabric of European culture. The proposals would document and map the situation of linguistic diversity in Europe, taking into consideration existing frameworks, initiatives and working terminology established by the Council of Europe and UNESCO.\nThe proposals should identify examples of good practice that have resulted in richer use of languages in society, thus promoting multilingualism, and would support sharing of knowledge and good practices.\nMoreover, in recent decades, multilingual regions have been affected by a confluence of demographic, socio-economic, and sociocultural challenges. An aging population coupled with lower birthrates has strained these communities, leading to a decrease in the number of native speakers who can transmit their linguistic heritage to younger generations. The housing crisis affecting several of these regions, also driven by tourism, exacerbates this dilemma, as economic pressures force long-time residents to leave their ancestral homes. Migration, while enriching in diversity, often further dilutes the linguistic fabric as newcomers bring different linguistic traditions and younger generations gravitate toward globally dominant languages. The sociocultural landscape is equally challenging, with the loss of monolingual minority speakers and community life and the media environments that increasingly prioritize universal appeal and dominant languages over local authenticity. This is particularly acute for itinerant or dispersed communities, e.g. Roma communities, whose linguistic heritage is often overlooked in mainstream narratives.\nThe proposals should explore how these elements have changed the language situation in those areas and how the different regions have adapted to the new linguistic environment, and what are the effects on the local economy. Particular attention should be given to languages with limited institutional support to explore how better visibility and accurate representation could be achieved.\nAnother element changing the game for language learning and safeguarding heritage are digital technologies. The projects should address the online presence of different languages and explore how language technologies could overcome the deepening linguistic divide in the digital domain [1] , while also documenting the availability of language data. Proposals should also look at the presence of different languages in different forms of media, arts and wider forms of cultural expressions. Projects could also explore how digital platforms and AI tools can aid in language preservation, especially for endangered regional languages.\nThe projects should explore the non-linguistic benefits of language maintenance, regeneration and learning. They could also look at how multilingualism and maintaining and learning heritage languages affects people’s wellbeing, self-respect and health due to the comfort, lower stress and sense of security at being able to speak their first language and not have their identity challenged. The actions should propose ways to encourage and support multilingual education and intergenerational transmission, including formal and non-formal learning settings. Particular consideration should be given to communities where formal education in the heritage language has historically been absent or discouraged.\nThe proposals should comprise transdisciplinary collaborations (including SSH disciplines) in resolving this issue involving, for instance and not exhaustive, linguistics, heritage and museum studies, media studies, theatre studies, literary studies, socio-economic, socio-cultural and migration studies etc. Available results of existing research on safeguarding linguistic diversity and multilingualism should be taken into consideration, while identification of needs for further research in the field should be promoted. Research could explore, among others, the role of oral transmission and its gendered component, in safeguarding languages at risk and methods to ensure its conservation. This is particularly relevant for languages where oral storytelling, music, and intergenerational dialogue play a central role in cultural transmission.\nThe projects should have a dedicated place for linguistic cartography (meaningful representations of linguistic diversity) and explore what are the challenges of assigning language to space; current language mapping projects, and what are the opportunities for improving language mapping with current technology.\nThe projects could explore how language maps could serve as educational or research tools, to provide illustrations of linguistic and cultural diversity. Pursuing cultural awareness and cultural diversity understanding makes language mapping a significant research objective.\nProposals should develop recommendations for promoting multilingualism in our societies and safeguarding of linguistic diversity, empowering citizens to take ownership for safeguarding their linguistic heritage. These recommendations should also aim at combating marginalisation of disadvantaged linguistic communities, including itinerant and stateless groups.\nProposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, networks and platforms, notably the ones funded by the EU. For example, they could include past initiatives such as the 1996 Euromosaic study. The study documented the linguistic diversity of the 12 original EC countries and later of newer members which joined the EU. The Mercator European Research Centre on Multilingualism also carried out many regional EU-funded dossiers, which would benefit from updating.\nSynergies could also be created with the European Data Space for Languages and the ALT-EDIC initiative. [2]\nFurthermore, links should be established and synergies sought with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, proposals should establish links to, and where appropriate build on findings from, projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-01: Safeguarding endangered languages in Europe and ‘HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-05: Strategies to strengthen the European linguistic capital in a globalised world.\nProposals should engage local communities, citizens and civil society organisations, in the development of their actions, using participatory approaches.\n[1] Building i.a. on the European Language Equality (ELE) project reports analysing the linguistic landscape of Europe, providing insights into the availability and quality of digital tools and resources for various European languages.\n[2] ALT-EDIC - European Commission",

      "scope": "Trafficking in cultural goods is a serious crime that poses significant threats to cultural heritage, particularly in conflict and crisis areas. This illicit trade involves the illegal import, export, and transfer of ownership of valuable cultural items, including theft from institutions and private collections, looting of archaeological sites, assets laundering and forgery of cultural goods. At the EU level, combatting cultural goods’ trafficking is supported by the EU Security Union Strategy 2020-2025 [1] , the EU Strategy to Tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025 [2] , the EU action plan against trafficking in cultural goods [3] and the related Council Conclusions [4] , [5] , [6] , the EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (EU-SOCTA) [7] . Cultural goods’ trafficking is a highly specialised criminal market. The criminals range from specialised criminal networks to corrupt dealers or expert dark web traders. Criminal networks and actors active in the area of cultural goods trafficking are characterised by a high degree of expertise and specialised knowledge [8] . To overtake the challenges there is the necessity to use advanced analytics, including machine learning and AI technologies, in order to curate, process and share large volumes of dynamic interoperable and high-quality data and transforming it into meaningful intelligence. By facilitating data exchange across borders and between stakeholders, it would ensure real-time access to relevant information, enhancing collaboration and coordination.\nProposals should strongly build on existing expertise and developments, focusing on (1) developing a cohesive ecosystem to be promoted among LEAs, with integrations and operational interfaces between existing tools, systems (including LEA systems) and the solutions developed to trace, protect, safeguard and repatriate goods, including methodologies for combating crimes through data and network analysis; (2) fostering the utilisation of the aforementioned systems by LEA and push them forward to market readiness level to ensure their effective impact on combating illicit trafficking cases; (3) strengthening the collaboration between the different stakeholders providing effective tools and actionable and standardized training materials for boosting capacity in cataloguing and provenance information analysis; (4) improving data quality, robust data governance and data interoperability across stakeholders and cross borders, improving LEA access to critical databases; (5) provide support to evidence collection thanks to the analysis and interpolation of different sources of information and open source and geospatial intelligence.\nProposals should design and consolidate the solution space, tools and the training ecosystem to demonstrate real uptake and adoption and ensure they reflect the priorities of diverse personas, including law enforcement authorities, customs officials, police authorities, cultural heritage professionals, policymakers and citizens. The training ecosystem should build on the results and findings of relevant national and EU-funded projects, such as for example OPFA-CULT [9] , in order to leverage existing knowledge and avoid duplication of effort. The development of these materials should be integrated with existing EU and international legal frameworks and measures on the trafficking of cultural goods, including those applicable beyond EU borders [1] [2] [3] . For police authorities’ training-related aspects, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding.\nThe proposals should build on the achievements and findings of related previous national and EU-funded projects as well as create complementarities or synergies with projects and European research infrastructures in the field, such as, for example the ones funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, ERC, the Internal Security Fund (ISF), Creative Europe, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), the European research infrastructure for heritage science (E-RIHS). Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) 18activities and/or other international events.\nProposals are encouraged to seek synergies, and collaboration, with relevant initiatives already developed from international stakeholders working in the field of cultural heritage as well as in the security sector. The creation of new tools and the duplication of existing ones should be avoided; instead, priority should be given to leveraging opportunities for consolidation and maximizing impact. of existing tools and resources.\nScientists and practitioners doing research in the field of Cultural Heritage (such as archaeologists, museologists, art historians or related fields) must have an essential role in the production of the outputs assuring that they efficiently take into account the real needs and problems of the field, as well as in ensuring scientific quality of information and data.\nProposals are encouraged to actively collaborate, create synergies and developments with the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) [13] and the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Proposals should ensure alignment on the formats and standards used to exchange interoperable high-quality data with the Cultural Heritage Cloud.\nBeneficiaries may plan their activities opting to provide Financial Support to Third Parties in order to support practitioners (such as Police Authorities, Non-Governmental Organisations/Civil Society Organisations, cultural and creative industries [CCIs], research groups and communities of practitioners in the field of Cultural Heritage) for expanding the proposed work in terms of, for instance, additional user groups and needs, complementary assessments, technology- or methodology-testing activities.\nProposals funded under this topic are expected to actively develop, configure and implement a long-term sustainable governance and cooperation framework which will ensure long term engagement beyond the duration of the funding. Particular emphasis should be placed on the co-creation of a detailed, realistic, and jointly agreed roadmap and validated business model to ensure functionality after the project ends. The model needs to be already validated and operational before the end of the funded project. The scope of the research should include under-studied regions, zones in conflict areas and under environmental disasters, considering existing initiatives, for example the Recommendation on Safeguarding Cultural Heritage in Ukraine [14] .\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020DC0605\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0170\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022DC0800\n[4] Council Conclusions on the fight against trafficking in cultural goods ‒ Council conclusions (8 June 2023) (10249/23)\n[5] Concept on Cultural heritage in conflicts and crises.

Both the economy and the European social model have to adapt to the great drivers of change, including demography, technology, global trade patterns, climate, and geopolitical shifts.\nFrom its side, the European social model is the basis of the still high level of productivity and competitiveness in the EU, and without continuously upgrading it and sustaining it, there is a risk of a series of negative consequences, ranging from an increase in poverty, to a deterioration of human capital and a decline in well-being.\nResearch (including by SSH disciplines) carried out should lead to recommendations to help Europe remain a world power through a high level of welfare, competitiveness and productivity, while analysing the tensions and opportunities created by the strengthening of the European social model and sustainable competitiveness through productivity. Proposals should look into possible opportunities and tensions between driving competitiveness, maintaining Europe’s social model and high environmental and biodiversity standards.\nClustering and cooperation among selected projects under this call topic and collaboration with the Social Transformations and Resilience partnership are strongly encouraged.\n[1] Nature is an essential part of competitiveness. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has demonstrated that around 55% of the global GDP is generated by sectors moderately to highly dependent on nature. Around 72% of euro area companies are critically dependent on ecosystem services.\n[2] https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en",

      "scope": "The increasing prevalence of digital devices in young people’s life has raised concerns about the potential impacts of the use of digital tools for leisure and communication on primary-, secondary- and higher education students’ well-being and educational outcomes [1] . “Digital distraction” is emerging inter alia as a potential threat to academic performance and several countries have started to regulate the use of smartphones at school.\nThere is still limited evidence on the interrelation between the use of digital tools for leisure in-school or out-of-school and educational performance, in both primary and secondary education, because most of the existing literature is purely correlational, or only focuses on effects on well-being. Moreover, most existing research is from extra-EU contexts, which may limit the transferability of findings to EU education and training systems.\nSeveral interrelated research questions remain to be addressed, such as:\n- Which types of digital device use do pupils perform during school and do their digital activities differ depending on different contexts (i.e., during class, during breaks or between classes)?\n- How do different activities (e.g. playing games vs. chatting with a parent), on different devices, with different time durations of use, relate to students’ attention span and concentration as well as general school motivation?\n- How does frequent smartphone, social media use and other online leisure activities (such as video games) impact students’ attention span, concentration, memory and relational capacities?\n- \n- How can schools, educators and parents balance the use of those tools to enhance, rather than hinder, educational performance and students’ well-being?\n- What is the potential for addiction when using digital tools and what are the decisive factors for this on the part of the design of tools on the one hand and on the part of the users on the other?\n- How can digital leisure activities contribute to skills development, such as problem-solving and digital literacy and what is the transferability of these skills into education? How do these benefits compare with potential harm?\n- What is the role of parents and educators in guiding digital leisure activities? Explore parental digital literacy and its impact on the use of digital devices by the youth.\nProposals should explore the complex, context-dependent ways in which different forms of digital leisure affect attention, motivation, creativity, learning habits, critical thinking, and socio-emotional skills. They should consider variations across age groups, socio-economic backgrounds, cultural contexts, and types of digital engagement and include students with disabilities.\nProposals should apply rigorous experimental and/or quasi-experimental methods for their analysis and could complement them with experience sampling research, survey research methods and qualitative research methods. Close cooperation with educational authorities, educational institutions and educators in analysing existing policies and practices is essential. Proposals should also include the opinions of young people and other relevant stakeholders, such as media literacy organisations, for example, in the form surveys, interviews, consultations, as part of the data collection. Proposals could apply interdisciplinary approaches (including from SSH disciplines), combining insights from economics, sociology, neurosciences, communication science (media psychology) and pedagogy.

Strong basic skill levels among young people and adults are key to sustaining EU productivity, innovation, competitiveness and growth, as also explained in the 2024 Draghi Report [1] . Other key EU initiatives support lifelong learning as a driver for productivity, innovation, and economic growth, for instance the 2022 Council Recommendation encouraging the implementation of Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs) in Member States.\nEvidence of causal relationship between basic skills on the one hand and productivity, innovation, competitiveness and economic growth, on the other is still limited in Europe, both at microeconomic and macroeconomic levels, mostly due to scarce use of longitudinal data. This also applies to the interplay between the basic skills and other skills (such as socio-emotional skills) in promoting productivity, innovation, competitiveness and growth.\nThere is also a need for better evidence (including from SSH disciplines) on which education and training policies and practices at all levels (school education, vocational education and training, higher education, adult education) can be effective in reducing gender, disability and socioeconomic disparities in basic skill acquisition and in subsequent labour market outcomes. The research should also better explore the competences that learners need to learn effectively with AI-based tools. Additional evidence is required on how to increase female participation in STEM and how to address teacher shortages, as well as on how to address barriers faced by persons with disabilities.\nProposals should address those research gaps by applying rigorous quantitative methods with a longitudinal perspective for their analysis and could complement them with qualitative research methods. Proposals should also evaluate the inclusion aspect, and the costs associated with the policies or practices analysed. Cooperation with education and training stakeholders is encouraged.

There is still limited research on what specific factors and their variability across Member States and Associated Countries (e.g. academic quality, career opportunities, cultural appeal, political context or funding availability) most influence the decision-making process for international students when choosing destinations. The same applies to the factors that can make a destination desirable for researchers and other high-skilled workers (e.g. quality of life, wages, professional opportunities, integration and family reunification measures, support to innovation ecosystem). More evidence is also needed about:\n- How policies and programmes can be successful in retaining students, researchers and high-skilled workers from abroad into the EU (and into Horizon Europe Associated Countries) in the medium-to-long term. Projects should assess the functioning of Talent Partnerships.\n- How to mobilise the professional potential of humanitarian migrants already in the EU in the context of global competition for talent.\nProposals should apply rigorous quantitative methods for their analysis of the abovementioned factors, policies and programmes and could complement them with qualitative research methods and relevant research from SSH disciplines. Proposals should also address the gender and disability dimensions of attracting and retaining talent. As the pull factors may differ among categories of migrants, proposals can choose which group to focus on: students, researchers and/or high-skilled workers.\nCooperation with higher education institutions, research institutions, non-academic organisations and notably industry, and social partners, as well as clustering and cooperation among selected projects under this call and other relevant projects, are strongly encouraged.",

      "scope": "Environmental challenges have been one of the key drivers of labour demand and skills supply across all sectors for the past years. More data and analysis from research on competences that young people and workers need for the green transition are warranted to properly implement the Union of Skills and support people in upskilling and reskilling. The availability of robust quantitative data is still limited, both at national and international levels. Moreover, most available research on the green transition focuses on macro-level policies, overlooking how workers and communities can drive change.\nFostering competences for the green transition also requires a better understanding of young people’s and workers’ attitudes, concerns and behaviours about climate change and climate action, biodiversity loss, pollution, circular economy and sustainable economic growth, as well as of new ways of developing capabilities and skills [1] . The transferability of skills across occupations and the need for upskilling and reskilling the current workforce are also key to advancing the green transition. These issues are interconnected with the ongoing digital transition.\nThe ‘green transition’ embraces a wide and diverse set of sectors and activities without one specific set of generic competences (in other words skills vary strongly depending on the sector). For example, according to Cedefop [2] , among high climate impact sectors the demand for skills for the green transition is the highest in energy. Therefore, proposals should focus on one of the following sectors, which are particularly affected by an increasing demand for green expertise: 1) sustainable agriculture and food production, 2) automotive industry, 3) energy and 4) construction, 5) nature and climate adaptation.\nProposals should use quantitative and qualitative methods (including from SSH disciplines) and apply a lifelong perspective to address several research questions, such as:\n- What are the most relevant competences required to actively contribute to the green transition in these industries?\n- Which assessment methods and frameworks are most effective in measuring readiness for green jobs and sustainable innovation?\n- What roles do digital skills and technological literacy play in equipping young people and workers for the green transition and how can education and training systems exploit the synergies between the competences for the green and digital transitions?\n- How can policymakers, education and training institutions and employers collaborate to identify and address skills shortages that may hinder the green transition?\n- How can vocational education and training systems become more accessible and flexible to respond effectively to evolving labour market needs for the green transition?\n- How to ensure that women and persons with disabilities benefit equally from the opportunities of the green transition?\n- How does an effective lifelong acquisition of competences for the green transition occur?\n- How can we design and implement inclusive systems that improve career advice, and support the best decisions by all learners regarding t their career choices and pathways?\n- What works to get disadvantaged children onto the pathways that are proven to lead to upwards mobility (including helping those who are not in education, employment or training) and raising ambition where needed? At what age are interventions most effective?\n- How can policymakers best create collaborations with industry to increase training opportunities, to ensure learners are as prepared as much as possible for work, and to reduce barriers to those from disadvantaged backgrounds?\nProposals should also consider the gender and disability dimensions in their analysis (ensuring that women, as well as persons with disability, benefit equally from employment and earning opportunities linked to the green transition). Clustering and cooperation among selected projects under this call topic and other relevant projects, for example from the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal Call and their results, are strongly encouraged.\nProposals should also explore synergies with the New European Bauhaus (NEB) Facility, including notably the NEB Academy on skills for sustainable construction, and the European Partnership on Social Transformations and Resilience.\n[1] GreenComp , the European competence framework on sustainability, provides a conceptual model on the knowledge, skills and attitudes which support sustainability in a lifelong learning context.\n[2] https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/files/9197_en.pdf",

      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to either the first and second (combined), or the third and fourth (combined) of the following expected outcomes:\n- Improved implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum through evidence-based insights in asylum and migration management, age assessment of minors, and resettlement frameworks, ensuring fair and efficient migration governance.\n- Insight into legal pathways addressing both EU Member States’ needs and potential offers of circular and permanent migration schemes in selected partner countries.\n- Enhanced health equity for migrants, including refugees by integrating robust health data into national systems, addressing governance barriers, and tackling intersectional inequities in healthcare access, identifying data/indicators on basic needs in health and sanitation, including as compared to adequate treatment.\n- Comprehensive evaluation of long-term social inclusion and integration strategies, providing evidence-based policy recommendations for labour market access, housing, education, health (including mental health), recognition of qualifications and validation of skills, youth participation, and social, political, and cultural inclusion.\nProposals should state clearly which expected outcomes their proposed research will contribute to.",
      "scope": "The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum [1] has introduced several key mechanisms requiring robust evidence to support their effective implementation. Proposals should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Pact’s components, including, for instance, the solidarity mechanism, the age assessment framework for minors, crisis and force majeure migration management, the EU externalisation policies on global migration patterns and the Union Resettlement and Humanitarian Admission Framework. This analysis should account for diverse national institutional landscapes and propose tailored policy recommendations that uphold human rights and enhance practical implementation.\nThe landscape of health data concerning migrants, including refugees is fragmented, incomplete, and often of low quality. This situation is compound by political, governance, legal and structural aspects that challenge the effective integration and utilisation of available data.\nProposals should map the existing landscape of health data integration for migrants, including refugees across national health information systems, evaluating existing data collection frameworks, methodologies, and technologies used to gather and integrate health information on migrant populations, highlighting potential systemic and organisational barriers. They should identify challenges and best practices that have successfully facilitated data integration while maintain high standard of data privacy and security and provide policy recommendations.\nMoreover, there is a lack of research exploring how intersecting factors such as age, gender, disability and legal status influence health outcomes among migrant and refugee populations, including older migrants. Addressing these gaps (including through a contribution of SSH disciplines) is essential for the development of informed policies that ensure equitable health care access and improve overall health outcomes with special consideration to persons in a vulnerable situation. Proposals should incorporate analysis of the impact of intersectional factors in access to health for migrant and refugees' populations.\nBeyond health, understanding the long-term impact of social inclusion and integration [2] strategies, is critical. Proposals should develop comprehensive and comparative evaluation frameworks to measure the effectiveness of existing strategies at the EU, national and local levels, identifying best practices at all levels (EU, national, local) and particularly the role of small and medium-sized towns; municipalities and recommending innovative policy adjustments. Areas of focus should include labour market access, mobility options of asylum seekers within the Dublin framework, housing, youth and women participation, the contribution of private sector and non-state actors and the broader social, political, and cultural inclusion of migrants, including refugee communities, including the role of education, as well as linguistic competence in the language of the receiving country. Proposals are encouraged to explore the biographical dimensions of integration, acknowledging the personal trajectories of migrants, including refugees. Research should also explore the relationship between migratory movements and social identity formation, ensuring that integration policies are adaptable to evolving societal dynamics and sustainable over time. Proposals should incorporate quantitative data and sound methodologies to identify effective practices, target groups, and enabling conditions to assess integration policies and in particular labour market integration outcomes. Wherever relevant proposals are encouraged to include migrants and/or refugees as participants in their research assessing first-hand their experiences, needs, attitudes and opinions.\nProposals may envisage JRC participation, drawing on its cross-cutting expertise in migration governance, social inclusion, and integration including from a health aspect. The JRC could, for example, contribute to comparative policy analysis, harmonised data collection across Member States, and evidence-based support to EU-level decision-making, utilising its experience in modelling policy mechanisms, analysing data and developing indicators, analysing inequalities, and providing forecasting and foresight on migration trends.\nWhere relevant, proposals may consider citizen engagement and dialogue beyond migrants, including refugees, with a view to collecting broader input.\n[1] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/pact-migration-and-asylum_en\n[2] Integration should be understood as a two-way process.",

      "scope": "In the EU, the number of people with long-term care needs is projected to increase in the future. In 2070, this number is expected to be 21% higher than in 2020.This increase is largely due to the acceleration of population ageing and also relates to higher needs for palliative care. At the same time, many Member States already struggle to meet all the long-term care needs now due to workforce shortages, which are likely to aggravate in future as the long-term care workforce is itself ageing and the sector is not attractive due to difficult working conditions, limited career development pathways and low professional standards.\nScientific evidence from research and innovation (including from SSH disciplines) is needed to help address the increasing demand for long-term care in the EU in the context of shrinking labour resources and increasing pressures on public and private budgets.\nIn line with the European Care Strategy and complementing the activities of the European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems [1] , proposals should:\n- evaluate the effectiveness of existing national/regional long-term care policies in terms of meeting the current long-term care needs through sufficient and adequately skilled long-term care workers, making formal long-term care affordable, accessible and of high quality; in that respect, evaluate the role of integrated care and the interplay of long-term care and other social services;\n- develop robust methodologies to model projections until 2070, for long-term care needs and supply including in terms of workforce and types of services, and corresponding public funding needs for at least 15 EU Member States; quantify the cost of non-action in terms of impact on unmet LTC needs, health and well-being outcomes, and missed opportunities for economic returns;\n- identify and analyse innovative policy mixes, including based on social innovation, to address long-term care needs and long-term care supply challenges, with available and/or new public/private resources, including by tapping into the potential of digitalisation and new technologies. Aspects for consideration may include addressing workforce and skills shortages by increasing the attractiveness of the long-term care sector through improved working conditions and social protection of the long-term care workforce; the deployment of digital solutions including AI-based; investigating the cost-effectiveness in the use of public budgets for health and social care and the role of private funding in the sector.\nApplicants are encouraged to consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences domain, [2] as well as the body of LTC policy analysis developed by the European Commission [3] . Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nApplicants aiming to address the implications of demographic changes on health and care systems should check in advance which areas are covered by the Transforming Health and Care Systems partnership and what research the partnership is performing to avoid a duplication of efforts or potential double funding.\nProposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) [4] based on its experience and with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and policymaking.\nProposals should integrate a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach to address the diverse long-term care policy needs of care-recipients and caregivers.\nTo maximise impact and avoid unnecessary duplication, proposals should envisage, as appropriate, cooperation with Horizon Europe projects such as the ones funded by the call topic HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-10, “Socio-economic effects of ageing societies” [5] and the HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08 call topic entitled “Integrated care solutions leading to better quality, person-centred long-term [6] .\n[1] See https://www.thcspartnership.eu/ or https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095654\n[2] https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ri-portfolio/table/\n[3] https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/social-protection-social-inclusion/social-protection/long-term-care_en\n[4] DG JRC research activity on long-term care and demography aims to analyse the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (such as dementia) and implication on LTC demand and analysis of household composition (family structure changes) and implications on LTC provision.\n[5] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2022-transformations-01-10\n[6] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2023-transformations-01-08",

      "scope": "As mentioned in the Report ‘Align, Act, Accelerate: Research, Technology and Innovation to boost European Competitiveness’ [2] , European RD&I can provide a new understanding of and solutions to tackle societal challenges. Social sciences and humanities (SSH) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) improve the research activities, outcomes and impacts of Horizon Europe, because they enable a greater understanding of societal and competitiveness benefits. The cooperation of SSH and STEM in through trans- and interdisciplinary science is part of a science that is excellent, as it not only delivers excellence in the technical aspects, but also in taking account different societal needs. Thus, there is need for a leading role at European level for this cooperation.\nProposals are expected to create an SSH-STEM Action, that focusses on SSH-STEM monitoring, SSH-STEM facilitation and SSH-STEM promotion, at European level, which should also include all the following aspects:\n1. Monitoring :\nMonitoring is a major aspect of the essential activities [3] .\nThe action should create a new strategy in the first year of the project with the aim to develop and to monitor the SSH-STEM research cooperation (e.g. A.I. search tools). This monitoring strategy should meet the following requirements:\n- Applicants should provide a clear justification of what significant steps forward they propose regarding methodology compared to previous reporting on SSH-STEM collaboration (see relevant reports), data management, analytical methods, data collection. Robust open data driven approaches are strongly encouraged.\n- Applicants should describe what steps they will undertake to ensure the delivery of reporting on a yearly basis, which should include the data collection, data analysis, and interpretation of SSH-STEM related cooperation data (in EU-funded projects in Horizon Europe where there is SSH-STEM cooperation).\n2. Facilitation and promotion :\nApplicants should develop guidelines for SSH-STEM cooperation and support stakeholders in their projects when SSH-STEM cooperation is possible within the project, with a focus on increasing the quality and depth of cooperation and applying cooperation where most relevant. Applicants are encouraged to propose approaches, such as training to researchers on how to best integrate either STEM or SSH into their research. In addition, applicants should take into account the collaboration within SSH sciences on their own, as well as attention for not only quantitative SSH disciplines, but also qualitative SSH.\nThe action should organize an annual event showcasing SSH and STEM cooperation; with exchanges with / for policy makers, best practice examples and showcasing funded projects/ programs at EU, national and other levels.\nThe action is also expected to provide a quantitative and qualitative R&D evidence base on how to ensure that policies (including funding) aimed at stimulating research & innovation are appropriate for the sectors which have the greatest potential to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness. Applicants should propose evaluation metrics for SSH-STEM cooperation within research projects.\n3. SSH/ STEM Science for Policy :\nAn important part of promotion is that the action acts as an SSH/ Science for policy exchange as well, providing the European Commission with feedback and advice on SSH-STEM cooperation, and informing the European Commission of the latest developments in SSH-STEM cooperation (which is why the inclusion of SSH experts is of the upmost importance).\nThe action is expected to be a forum that promotes dialogue and cooperation among research funders and policy makers in the EU (linked to the European Research Area) and beyond to further the integration of SSH and STEM in EU-funded R&I initiatives.\nThe action should provide monitoring guidance in SSH and STEM cooperation in R&I programmes at national/regional and European level.\nThe consortium should contribute to the priorities of the European Research Area, the EU Competitiveness Compass to strengthen the EU competitiveness and resilience. The consortium is expected to liaise with the two Cluster 2 co-funded European Partnerships and look into successful SSH integration projects and initiatives funded at EU level.\nThe action should recognize the diversity within SSH disciplines and their differing levels of integration with STEM. It should include targeted strategies to increase humanities’ participation alongside qualitative and quantitative social sciences to ensure balanced SSH representation. STEM domain prioritization should be driven by thematic relevance and feasibility for SSH cooperation.\nProjects should adopt a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach when integrating SSH and STEM. This means considering a variety of societal needs and perspectives to ensure inclusivity and equality in research and innovation in EU and national R&I policies.\n[1] SSH integration involves actively supporting interdisciplinary research and innovation that combines SSH with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) to better address complex challenges such as climate change, public health issues, and technological innovation.\n[2] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2f9fc221-86bb-11ef-a67d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[3] e.g. see the report ‘Integration of social sciences and humanities in Horizon 2020’ (https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/16b7df93-82b3-11ee-99ba-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) and the ‘Horizon Europe Integration’-report for 2021-2023 (https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/6cf8db13-62bb-11f0-bf4e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en).",

      "scope": "Europe is undergoing critical social transformations driven by macro drivers of change, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, digitalisation and demographic change, which have been accelerated by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. These transformations bring challenges and opportunities such as changing skills demands and labour shortages, new digital and intergenerational divides, increasing inequalities and threats to social cohesion, and rising costs of social protection, among others. The magnitude of these social transformations as well as the heterogeneity in welfare systems and labour markets call for combined inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge and resource sharing, and long-term concerted actions, on the basis of a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA).\nProposals for the co-funded Social Transformations and Resilience (STR) partnership should aim at creating a 7-year research and innovation programme [1] which will make use of the potential of SSH to build resilience, ensure fairness and inclusiveness and foster social cohesion in the light of changes in climate, the environment, technology, demography and unexpected shocks. To this end, proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes, with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.\nInnovations and scientific results achieved are expected to contribute to reaching EU priorities in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Green Deal, to strengthening the European Research Area (ERA) and the European Education Area (EEA) and to contribute to designing better national, regional and local policies, in line with their respective strategies.\nAn additional objective is to contribute to the implementation of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reducing Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 13 (Climate Action), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).\nTo achieve these objectives, the partnership is expected to launch annual transnational calls for proposals and additional activities in four interconnected impact areas:\n- Supporting the modernisation of social protection systems and essential services\n- Shaping the future of work\n- Fostering education and skills development\n- Contributing to a fair transition to climate neutrality\nThe STR partnership is expected to organise activities along the following six operational objectives:\n- Collect data and evidence to measure social transformations, drawing from a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods in the social sciences and humanities, and use these to inform the development of evidence-based public policies and strategies.\n- Promote comparative studies to identify and share best practices and failures at regional, national and EU level.\n- Construct new, innovative ways to connect researchers with policymakers, stakeholders, citizens and social innovators in working together, communicating needs and results.\n- Develop social and individual experimentations at all levels (subnational, national, European) to better understand the impact of social transformations and public policies.\n- Encourage the development of new analytical, methodological and epistemological tools to better understand social transformations and resilience.\n- Build capacity among the R&I community and policymakers to adjust and strengthen social infrastructures and services in light of unexpected shocks.\nProposals should build on the work of ERA-NETs CHANSE, as well as other relevant networks and initiatives, such as HERA and NORFACE, the Trans-Atlantic Platform for Social Sciences and Humanities (T-AP) and the Joint Programming Initiative More Years, Better Lives (JPI MYBL). By bringing together different stakeholders in academia, policymakers, social partners and trade associations, civil society and international organisations, the partnership should create a critical mass of knowledge and resources to implement a long-term SRIA.\nThe partnership should engage with the following stakeholders: (i) National research funding agencies and ministries in research and higher education; (ii) ministries responsible for labour, social affairs, employment, climate and environment, where possible, as well as other relevant public authorities in the four impact areas; (iii) researchers from the social sciences and humanities and transdisciplinary fields; (iv) social partners, citizens’ organisations and NGOs at local, national and EU level, such as trade unions, employer associations, practitioners and non-profit organisations advocating for the rights of disadvantaged groups; (v) private sector, which may include employment agencies, providers of essential services, social entrepreneurs, and private education institutions.\nAs the partnership touches upon fundamental aspects of peoples’ lives (work, social protection, education, and a fair green transition), it is instrumental to involve relevant actors, interest groups and potential end-users of the research results in the partnership’s activities. Gender and intersectional aspects should be considered throughout all activities and joint calls.\nEU agencies (e.g. Eurofound, ELA, CEDEFOP [2] ) which deal with issues related to the four impact areas, such as working conditions, vocational education and training, and labour law, as well as international organisations such as the ILO and the OECD, need to be considered as stakeholders, as they can provide important inputs and resources to the partnership. Collaboration with existing research infrastructures (e.g. European Social Survey, SHARE, CLARIN, CESSDA, Eurostat) is encouraged. This should aim at facilitating access to data (e.g. on social security) and making use of relevant datasets in the projects that will be funded under this partnership.\nThe partnership is open to all EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. Partners are expected to contribute financially and/or through eligible activities [3] , depending on the level of ambition of the proposed activities. The partnership should be open to new partners throughout its lifetime. Importantly, the EU contribution will not be increased.\nTo ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and joint activities, the partnership is expected to establish synergies with relevant Horizon Europe projects under relevant Clusters of Pillar II, partnerships - such as the Driving Urban Transitions (DUT) partnership or the Clean Energy Transition (CET) partnership, the Biodiversa+ partnership, the Missions - such as the Mission on climate-neutral and smart cities or the Mission on Climate Adaptation - and the New European Bauhaus Facility, among others.\n[1] With an additional three years to wind down, i.e. administer and report on FSTP projects launched with the last calls.\n[2] In line with rules for Horizon Europe on working with EU’s Decentralised Agencies.\n[3] Any eligible activity that is distinct from and complements the financial support to third parties/joint transnational calls and contributes to the objectives of the partnership.",

      "scope": "The European Union has been actively working to combat racism, xenophobia, hate speech, hate crimes, and extremism in recent years, developing and implementing various strategies to address these issues [1] . Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe have also played a crucial role in funding projects that aim to develop research and collect evidence on how to counter and prevent radicalisation, polarisation, hate speech and extremism. These phenomena pose significant risks, as they can undermine trust in democratic institutions, weaken the social contract, and contribute to rising inequalities and instability.\nEuropean research (including research by SSH disciplines) should combine a clear understanding of the mechanisms that play a fundamental role in the circulation of online hate speech, radicalisation, extremism, and polarisation with the development of strategies to prevent and counter these phenomena. At the same time, it should promote the Union values enshrined in the Treaty on European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and the protection of democratic institutions, as a condition for everyone's talents to flourish and for fostering a cohesive society and a culture of tolerance and pluralism. This will contribute to enhance the prevention of violent extremism, hate speech and hate crime and the promotion of a more inclusive and resilient society.\nThe spread of hate speech and extremist ideologies online has become a major concern, and the need for effective solutions to address these issues is pressing. Hate speech and extremism can be criminal offences, but also more broadly contribute to polarisation and have a chilling effect on freedom of expression, also limiting the engagement of individuals in public life (e.g. elected officials stepping down from elections because of hate attacks). Moreover, the polarisation of society and the erosion of trust in institutions pose a threat to social cohesion and democratic values.\nTo address these challenges, it is essential also to foster the understanding on the root causes of radicalisation, extremism, hate and polarisation, including as concerns the impact of socio-economic factors. This requires also collaboration with end-users, such as civil society organisations and practitioners [2] , who can provide valuable insights and help develop solutions that are tailored to their specific needs and contexts.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other EU-funded projects related to preventing radicalisation, extremism, hate speech, and polarisation, financed by the Horizon programmes (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and complementary funding schemes (such as the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme, the Internal Security Fund, or others) and to explore potential opportunities for collaboration with them. Proposals should integrate a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach to illustrate how radicalisation, extremism, hate speech and polarisation disproportionately affect different groups and groups of different ages.\nInitiatives of research such as the ones in the EU Knowledge Hub on Prevention of Radicalisation [3] (previously Radicalisation Awareness Network) or the forthcoming online knowledge hub under the Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online should be considered when developing initiatives to upscale and exploit solutions to combat extremism, hate speech and radicalisation. Research activities should meaningfully involve a wide range of stakeholders and societal actors, particularly civil society organisations, including non-academic and non-scientific actors. Projects should link appropriately with the envisaged European Centre for Democratic Resilience and seek to make best use of its stakeholder platform.\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/combating-hate-speech-and-hate-crime_en\n[2] See, for example: https://edmo.eu/\n[3] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/eu-knowledge-hub-prevention-radicalisation_en",

      "scope": "Autocratic regimes, armed conflicts, and global geopolitical shifts pose significant threats to fundamental rights. These challenges manifest in the rollback of legal protections, increased political violence, shrinking civic space, and targeted discrimination, both offline and online. In this context, a deeper understanding of the disproportionate impact of these crises on different groups is key to developing more targeted and effective policies.\nThe proposed research should examine the intersection of age, gender, sex, sexual orientation, minority status, or migratory background, in contexts of democratic erosion, authoritarian governance, and geopolitical crises. It can focus on one or multiple groups in a vulnerable situation, such as women, LGBTIQ people, ethnic and/or religious minorities, people with disabilities, children or the elderly. Case studies could be selected to reflect a wide range of geopolitical contexts, including regions undergoing democratic erosion, post-conflict reconstruction, or consolidation of authoritarian rule.\nThe proposed research should analyse how legal and institutional frameworks are weaponised and leveraged by authoritarian actors to restrict rights, the role of civil society in resisting repression, and the impact of digital surveillance, algorithmic discrimination and online disinformation in targeting specific groups in a vulnerable situation.\nParticular attention should be given to the restricted access to sexual and reproductive health rights during crises, armed conflicts, and geopolitical shifts, as well as the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV). In such contexts, GBV can be frequently used as a coercive tactic, reinforcing discrimination and reversing progress on gender equality. Hate-motivated violence can become even more complex when directed at women and groups in a vulnerable situation, further limiting their access to humanitarian assistance and undermining their fundamental rights. Therefore, the proposed research should develop prevention and response strategies for public administration, law enforcement, and military bodies to combat GBV effectively in crisis situations.\nProposals should take an interdisciplinary approach, combining SSH disciplines with insights from computer science and data analytics. They should integrate a strong data-driven approach and could explore aspects such as:\n- Mapping and measuring the compounded effects of conflict, forced displacement, and democratic backsliding on access to rights, services, and political participation.\n- Developing new methodologies and indicators to assess the impact of shrinking civic space and legal rollbacks on gender and minority rights.\n- Creating data-driven tools or policy dashboards to monitor the evolving risks faced by women, LGBTIQ people, and/or various minority groups in authoritarian and post-conflict settings.\nProposals should adopt a multi-scalar approach that connects grassroots-level experiences of discrimination and exclusion with macro-level geopolitical, legal and policy frameworks. Proposals could assess how international and European actors can effectively counter these trends through diplomatic efforts, development cooperation, and targeted support for civil society. Engaging with policymakers, human rights organisations, and affected communities is essential.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects, notably in cluster 2 and 3, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them. In order to achieve the topic’s expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).",

      "scope": "Research should examine schools as a locus for practicing participation and developing innovative participatory practices.\nResearch should examine student and family engagement to foster a democratic culture via school activities. It should consider schools as social places for intergenerational dialogue.\nResearch should examine the role of socio-emotional learning in tackling sensitive topics in the classroom and in fostering civic agency development among learners. Research could explore the emotions that drive civic engagement and investigate strategies to help students emotionally cope with frustrations when their civic engagement efforts do not unfold as expected. Research should integrate an intersectional approach that is sensitive to gender and ability, by studying how students contribute to and respond to civic engagement efforts differently according to their identity and backgrounds.\nResearch should examine the active role of families in building children and young people's civic identity. Parents/caregivers and the wider family are key in children and young people’s informal learning, shaping their interests, values, and world-views; family involvement in school citizenship education might vary in more diverse communities, depending on the family’s cultural, migrant or socio-economic backgrounds; some families may not appreciate the importance of teaching about social issues, democracy, or civic participation or may feel excluded or disconnected from schools’ efforts to provide citizenship education. Research should examine how citizenship education is reinforced or challenged outside the classroom, especially with growing polarization and diversity of our societies. The research should provide recommendations of how to effectively engage families from diverse backgrounds in their children's citizenship education. The main focus should be on parents and caregivers (legal guardians); exploring other wider family influences is also possible.\nResearch should examine families’ and students' views on the content of citizenship education and examine the role of curriculum design in promoting inclusive civic engagement among students from diverse backgrounds. Arts and humanities can be part of the disciplines examined where relevant. Research should aim to identify the types of collaboration that not only bolster students' civic competence but also ensure inclusivity in their engagement.\nThe research should investigate the effectiveness of student councils and other participatory mechanisms in providing meaningful opportunities for student influence. Research should investigate the incentives and motives behind participation and uncover possible restrictions and motives for non-participation. It should exploit the tools that have been already developed in previous research projects in the area of civic participation.\nResearch should address the lack of formal monitoring and evaluation of these participatory mechanisms. It should develop frameworks, guidance, and tools for evaluation of socio-emotional learning, including values and attitudes as part of citizenship education.\nResearch can explore whether and how engaging families in citizenship education and fostering of a democratic culture at school influences both the civic participation of children and young people, and that of their families. Emphasis could be placed on schools in marginalised areas or with high migrant populations, to uncover structural barriers to civic engagement in those settings.\nResearch should include pilots or living labs, developing innovative participation practices in schools, where students learn to recognise and exercise their citizenship rights and obligations, strengthen the value of democracy, and build their identity as active citizens. Projects should collaborate with schools and education authorities in the development and running of these pilots and living labs.\nProjects may freely choose the age group they will examine, as long as it remains within primary and/or secondary education levels.\n[1] The Action plan on basic skills (March 2025) explicitly recognises citizenship as a basic skill, and it defines it as: “The ability to act responsibly and participate fully in civic life, grounded in an understanding of social, economic, legal and political structures. This involves understanding and evaluation of civic and democratic concepts, institutions and processes, including democracy, media literacy, crisis preparedness and respect for others and freedom of speech.”",

      "scope": "The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies, along with their malicious use such as the creation of artificially generated and manipulated content,, profoundly impacts democracy, equality, social inclusion, and knowledge production, and contributes to the rise of cyberviolence. Although AI can offer many opportunities, its misuse can facilitate/amplify inequalities and power imbalances, spread misinformation and cyberviolence against women, children and minorities, concentrate data control, and undermine democratic processes. Hence, this topic addresses both the malicious use of AI (e.g. AI-generated disinformation, deepfakes, cyberviolence) and its unintentional societal consequences (e.g. algorithmic opacity, amplification of bias).\nAI’s role in media influence and public trust demands urgent attention, as the rise of AI-generated or manipulated content, including deepfakes, threatens democratic processes and epistemic rights. A key area of concern is how AI and artificially generated content is impacting cyberviolence, and the effect it has on individuals or groups who distrust democracy, particularly where this distrust intersects with far-left and far-right populism and foreign interference.\nProposals should explore how AI-driven technologies and their use may either exacerbate or mitigate [2] inequalities and discriminations based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic background, religion or belief, age, and disability, particularly in access to information, decision-making, and representation. A critical analysis is needed of how data - often reflecting existing social biases - can reinforce or challenge dominant social structures and safety, and how such technologies shape public perceptions and knowledge production.\nThe research should also explore the risks these technologies pose to democratic integrity, particularly through the manipulation of public opinion, electoral processes, and governance systems. Deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation and disinformation can distort facts, spread false narratives, and undermine public trust. Addressing these concerns requires a comprehensive understanding of how AI may be (mis)used to shape political campaigns, media narratives, public engagement, and the spread and dissemination of (gendered) disinformation. Proposals are encouraged to examine how AI-generated content across media, including entertainment media, influence public opinion, social narratives, gender stereotypes and norms, and civic engagement.\nFurthermore, proposals should look into how cyberviolence, including online harassment, cyberbullying, threats, and gender-based violence, is exacerbated by sharing manipulated content like deepfakes, deep nudes and AI-driven sextortion on online platforms through manipulated content like deepfakes, deep nudes and AI-driven sextortion. Research should identify how AI may be used to amplify and upscale harm, what the nature of the AI-powered output is, and which groups are disproportionately affected by it, looking particularly at women and minorities, and explore interventions to prevent and mitigate these risks. This includes analysing not only the unintended reproduction of cyberviolence through biased outputs, but also the ways in which AI-powered platforms may be misused by users to generate and/or spread harmful, discriminatory or violent content. A comprehensive assessment of unregulated AI-induced risks of sexual exploitation, violence, and gender-based harm is largely missing for effective regulation, oversight, and prosecution. A multidisciplinary review is needed to evaluate AI-driven risks exposing children, young people, women, older persons and LGBTIQ people to such violence online and offline.\nProposals should research on policy and concrete practices that can effectively address the challenges posed by AI technologies, taking into consideration the EU Regulation on artificial intelligence and subsequent guidance being developed to support its implementation. Proposals should identify best practices and regulatory measures to ensure the ethical deployment of AI and AI literacy while safeguarding equality and democratic integrity. A key aspect of this research is recognising AI’s growing role in shaping policy and judicial decisions. While its integration can improve efficiencies, concerns about bias and fairness persist. Proposals are encouraged to explore AI’s influence on legal and policy outcomes, including unintended consequences.\nAdditionally, proposals should consider AI’s use and impact on young people. Although AI is not specifically designed for minors, youth are among its most active users. Biases within AI-generated or manipulated content, particularly related to sex gender, sexual orientation, ethnic and racial background, can shape young users’ perceptions, perpetuate stereotypes, affect engagement and mental and physical well-being. Research should investigate how AI systems influence these aspects, and the opportunities and risks associated, including the potential psychological effects of exposure to biased or harmful content.\nA key focus should be interdisciplinary research on AI’s role in societal resilience, countering misinformation and disinformation, enhancing civic engagement, and supporting marginalised communities. Proposals should explore inclusive and innovative tools and methodologies for detecting and mitigating deepfakes, disinformation, and cyberviolence facilitated through AI, designed for broad adoption by policymakers, technology developers, media organisations, and the general public.\nEffectively addressing these multifaceted challenges demands to combine data-driven analysis, drawing on expertise from a wide range of fields, including both academic disciplines (e.g., computer science, and SSH disciplines such as communication and media sciences, ethics, law, political science, sociology, psychology, and gender studies) and the applied perspectives of those involved in shaping and steering AI technologies in practice.\nThis research should contribute to the EU’s broader AI strategy, supporting the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Act and aligning with the EU’s Political Guidelines for 2024-2029. This research should also contribute to the implementation of other EU legislative frameworks, such as the Directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence, that criminalises various cyberviolence offences, including malicious deepfakes, and the Digital Services Act, which addresses illegal content online, including false or manipulated information inciting hate or discrimination. It should also inform global discussions on ethical AI governance and responsible innovation.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nThe projects selected for funding are encouraged to collaborate with the JRC to seek synergies with its work on innovations in public governance [3] .\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act).\n[2] Including how trustworthy and human-centric AI can be leveraged to support content moderation, fact-checking, and online monitoring.\n[3] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/innovations-public-governance_en",

      "scope": "The European Union's development aid efforts face significant challenges in promoting democracy and stability in third countries, despite substantial investments in development assistance. Many countries continue to face challenges related to democratic governance, and the relationship between aid and its impact on inequality reduction, poverty alleviation, sustainable peace and security, as well as the strengthening of democratic institutions and processes, remains unclear. The resurgence of authoritarianism and the erosion of democratic values globally pose considerable challenges to EU foreign policy, underscoring the need for more effective diplomatic, security and development cooperation frameworks and strategies.\nThere is a pressing need for research (including by SSH disciplines) to elucidate the complex relationships between development aid, democratic governance, equality, security, and global challenges. This includes examining the effects of development aid on democratic institutions and processes, identifying gaps in funding for democratic governance, and exploring innovative approaches to supporting democratic governance and reducing inequality. In this context, the role of other non-EU aid donors, including public, private, and philanthropic actors, must be understood. This includes examining the influence of the EU's economic and geopolitical competitors, to see why their support may be more attractive to developing countries, and how they are filling vacuums left by cuts from traditional donors, creating new socio-economic dependencies and power relations.\nThe scope of this research topic is broad, encompassing the interplay between development aid, security, and democratic governance, with a focus on reducing socio-economic and gender inequalities, fostering democratic resilience, and promoting inclusive governance. By investigating these dynamics, researchers can uncover new insights and strategies to align development assistance with democratic strengthening, ultimately contributing to more effective and sustainable development outcomes.\nKey areas of investigation include the impact of development aid on democratic institutions, the reduction of socio-economic and gender inequalities, and the identification of funding gaps for democratic governance initiatives, as well as the consequences of declining democratic trends on the effectiveness of global development strategies and the achievement of sustainable development goals.\nProposals should also seek to identify new opportunities to enhance the EU´s soft power and geopolitical influence across the Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus, including through the development of dedicated diplomacies (e.g., climate diplomacy, water diplomacy, science diplomacy, etc.). The actions should strive to include development aid civil society organisations in the activities.\nProposals should use a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach in their research.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects related to EU democracy support, civil society engagement, and international cooperation on sustainable peace and democratic governance, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nProposals may also incorporate participatory research approaches to enhance inclusivity and stakeholder engagement.\nThe geographical scope of this research includes the EU Enlargement, Neighbourhood [1] and low- and lower middle-income countries [2] , with a focus on the relationship of these with the EU. Therefore, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.\n[1] In the context of this call, the “EU Neighbourhood” is understood as the group of countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which includes countries to the East (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine) and to the South (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia).

      "scope": "Free and independent news media are key tenets of our democracies as they keep citizens informed, facilitate civic engagement across all democratic processes, and keep under scrutiny those in power. At present, journalistic newsrooms are under severe economic pressure and they face increasing forms of political influence and threats against media pluralism and independence. Social media forces them to compete for citizens’ attention with other forms of infotainment, which sometimes entail unverified opinions and low-quality or malicious sources. This is particularly affecting forms of journalism relying on original content, which takes more time and resources to produce (e.g. local media, investigative journalism, public interest news, journalistic magazines, etc.). There is evidence of market failures affecting these sectors, with phenomena such as emerging news deserts, limited coverage of certain regions and/or societal groups and newsrooms closing. As a result, certain societal groups are underserved in the media landscape, so the proposed research will benefit from adopting an intersectional approach.\nThere are still important quantitative and qualitative data gaps at European level that can help the news media sectors address these concerns, including accurate diagnoses of the challenges and opportunities for the news sectors. The Commission’s 2023 European Media Industry Outlook [1] signalled that “the future competitiveness of this sector will depend on its capacity to invest and innovate, as well as to manage and monetise content and data”. Applicants are invited to contribute to enhancing innovation across the news media sectors, in particular by addressing data gaps, researching inspirational examples of scalable models and testing industrial models that can advance financial independence as well as editorial independence. This should include areas and aspects such as:\na) providing comparable European consumer data, market data and models to analyse audience behaviour (including audience measurement tools) across societal groups and across Europe, so as to help news media improve their relevance, editorial quality, distribution channels and business models (including emerging formats, mediums, and technologies such as AI and XR);\nb) identification of market failures in news sectors of specific relevance to democracy, such as local media and investigative journalism, mapping of priority regions and/or themes, identification and analysis of business models that can address them;\nc) development, prototyping and testing of small-scale innovative user-centric business models that foster the involvement of citizens in high quality information production, monetisation, distribution and consumption (including community-based, local and accessible solutions, either physical or online);\nd) mapping and development of audience measurement systems, concrete suggestions to increase interoperability of tools and systems around common standards, and proposals for metadata taxonomies, to federate the news sectors and improve their negotiation power vis-à-vis tech and advertising companies.\ne) sharing of conclusions and concrete, hands-on action plans and practices for the industry and policy makers, through regular consultation, interactive sessions, active communication, etc.\nConsortia should:\n- bring together academia (including from SSH disciplines), civil society organisations and multiple news sectors representatives (including influencers and other content creators);\n- where applicable, leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces;\n- ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable);\n- seek collaboration whenever possible with relevant projects selected under previous EU-funded calls, such as the Horizon 2020 call topic TRANSFORMATIONS-10-2020 – “Evolving European media landscapes and Europeanisation” or the Horizon Europe one HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-06 – “Media for democracy – democratic media”.\nClustering and cooperation among the selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\n[1] The European Media Industry Outlook | Shaping Europe’s digital future",

      "scope": "The relationship between private companies [1] and democratic governance is becoming increasingly complex and contentious. As corporate interests continue to grow in influence, this raises concerns about the potential risks and benefits of private sector involvement, particularly in policymaking on contentious topics such as climate change adaptation, environmental protection, data protection, privacy, civil rights, and the rights of minorities. Thus, there is a pressing need to investigate the impact of private sector involvement on democratic processes and outcomes, as well as its long-term effects on political inequalities and shifts in power dynamics.\nLarge corporations and lobbying groups can inform policymaking with valuable evidence and expertise, but also potentially exert undue influence that may compromise the public interest. The implications of corporate power for democratic values, human rights, and the public good are far-reaching and require careful examination.\nMoreover, external private actors, such as foreign investors and multinational companies, together with influence activities within the EU internal market through service providers (for instance lobbying or political advertising) can shape democratic processes and outcomes, and, if not conducted responsibly, risk undermining the integrity of democratic debate.\nTo address these challenges, research is needed (including by SSH disciplines) to explore the complex relationships between private companies, lobbying groups and democratic processes, to develop tools to assess democratic impact of corporate practices, and to identify strategies to promote responsible corporate behaviour, to uphold transparency and democratic accountability of business practices and to ensure that private companies serve the needs of democracy and the public good.\nProposals should investigate the influence of large corporations, business lobbying groups, and external actors on democratic processes, exploring the implications of corporate power on democratic values, diversity, equality (including age equality), inclusion, human rights, and the public interest. This examination should also extend to the impact of private companies on multilateral decision-making, including at the EU level, and analyse how corporate interests shape decision-making processes at the transnational level.\nParticular attention should be given to the role of corporate lobbying, public-private partnerships, the role of corruption, perceived corruption, and undue influence originating from the private sector in undermining democratic governance and the public interest. This includes examining the potential for corrupt practices to emerge, such as bribery, revolving doors, and other forms of undue influence, which can erode trust in institutions and perpetuate inequalities. Furthermore, it is essential to investigate direct interferences by corporations that go beyond legitimate ways of involvement in public sector decision-making. These interferences can take many forms, including artificially spreading or amplifying disinformation in order to, influence public opinions, and steering behaviours, contributing to the normalization of extremist or polarizing actors and discourses, which can have far-reaching consequences.\nProposals are encouraged to critically examine the structural power of capital in shaping policy agendas and public discourse, and to consider how this power contrasts with that of labour and civil society. Proposals could encourage structured and sustained dialogue among business actors, citizens, regulators, and watchdog organizations, with the aim of developing inclusive and accountable governance frameworks that reflect diverse interests and promote transparency.\nProposals are encouraged to investigate the influence of private companies on democratic governance, such as – but not limited to – the potential risks and benefits of private sector involvement in sortition-based citizens' panels and other forms of participatory and deliberative democracy processes.\nProposals should use a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach in their research to analyse how the actions of private companies in a democracy impact individuals’ rights differently based on their identities.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects exploring the role of private companies in democracy and consider exploring potential collaboration opportunities with them [2] .\n[1] In this context, when referring to private companies, we specifically mean large undertakings, namely multinational and global corporations, including industry and tech platforms, as opposed to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n[2] For instance, but not limited to: HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-03: New approaches for combatting corruption and other undue influences on political decision-making.",

      "scope": "The promotion of human rights and gender and age equality is a pressing concern for the European Union in today's multipolar world, where vulnerable groups in a vulnerable situation and excluded or marginalized individuals, including ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, as well as women, and LGBTIQ people, face persecution, discrimination, and violence. The EU's response to these issues is influenced also by the complexities of global governance, trade, human rights and rule of law, and geopolitical interests.\nThe EU's values and human rights are being tested in a global context, where trade policies, supply chains, and labour rights are increasingly intertwined. The impact of sanctions and trade, conditionality, and other measures on human rights is unclear, and the role of national and international courts and international organisations in promoting accountability is uncertain and increasingly contested.\nMoreover, the EU's external actions and Member States’ foreign policies have internal consequences, for instance undermining their democratic reputation and values if they are perceived as inconsistent or hypocritical, or producing negative impacts on European enterprises in terms of access to markets or to critical raw materials. For groups, such as refugees, women, LGBTIQ people, elderly persons, and indigenous peoples, who are already subject to various types of exclusion and discrimination and who might be further disenfranchised by the EU's foreign policy, this is particularly problematic.\nThere is a need for research (including by SSH disciplines) to better understand these complex relationships and to identify innovative approaches to promoting and protecting human rights and gender equality. This includes examining the impact of trade policies and investments policies on human rights (including Global Gateway infrastructure investment strategy), and on the perception of the EU as a values-based actor, developing effective diplomatic strategies and cooperation frameworks, and investigating the role of national courts and international organisations in promoting accountability.\nProposals may also incorporate participatory research approaches to enhance inclusivity and stakeholder engagement.\nProposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU-funded projects related to EU democracy support, civil society engagement, and international cooperation on sustainable peace and democratic governance, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.\nThe geographical scope of this research should include the EU Neighbourhood [2] and low- and lower middle-income countries [3] , with a focus on the Western Balkan and the accession countries.

These results are followed up with appropriate assessments and Key Performance Indicators.\n- Innovation driven by the cultural and creative industries continues to be boosted beyond project funding through a long-term economically sustainable ecosystem.\n- A vision of European CCIs as an essential engine of sustainable innovation and competitiveness is broadly established, making CCIs a natural part of European, national, regional and local innovation efforts.",
      "scope": "The transition towards a consolidated culture- and creativity-driven European innovation ecosystem represents a strategic imperative for Europe's future competitiveness and societal resilience. In an era where technological advancements alone no longer guarantee competitiveness, the CCIs emerge as essential drivers of transformative change and prosperity. It is necessary to unlock the innovative power of Europe’s cultural and creative industries both in themselves and as drivers of innovation in other economic sectors. CCIs shape new technologies and can contribute to user-driven innovation, open innovation, cross-sectoral innovation [2] and to creative entrepreneurial ecosystems for regional development. CCIs are often the first to find productive uses for new technologies and establish meaningful connections between different technologies, thus paving the way for wider uptake that improves productivity and competitiveness in the wider economy. Europe’s CCIs can thus act as a crucial technology incubator, in addition to their wider societal contributions such as to cultural wealth, social cohesion and resilience.\nSignificant research and innovation efforts have been made to boost CCIs and strengthen them as engines of innovation. Notably, Horizon Europe’s Cluster 2 has launched more than 30 R&I projects with the collective objective to boost a culture and creativity driven European innovation ecosystem, establishing a collaborative platform for this purpose [3] . Furthermore, the European Institute for Innovation and Technology has established a Knowledge and Innovation Community for the Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries [4] , and a Large-Scale Partnership for the Cultural and Creative Industries Ecosystem has been set up under the EU Pact for Skills [5] .\nThe challenge is to build on, consolidate and complement, as appropriate, the key results such as technologies, solutions, methods, networks and platforms developed by these R&I projects and initiatives as well as by other relevant actions, with the objective to achieve long-term impact in terms of thriving CCIs that proactively engage in innovation and achieve significant economic growth.\nThe project funded under this topic should build on and improve existing innovation ecosystems to make them effective for the CCIs. Difficulties to properly boost CCI-driven innovation need to be overcome, such as those linked to CCIs consisting mainly of small and micro enterprises with difficulties to fit into commonly applied innovation support models based on fast-growth startups, challenges in properly valuing the IPR of CCIs, inconsistencies between cultural and innovation policies, or issues linked to the particularities of CCI entrepreneurs. Solutions should go beyond common practice in innovation support and deploy for example portfolio approaches that make clusters of organisations investable entities. The project does not need to seek standardised approaches that work across the full diversity of the CCIs and of EU Member States and Associated Countries but should allow for taking local contexts into account. Nevertheless, the project should seek to establish common principles and active knowledge exchange across Europe.\nTo properly follow up the results of its work, the project should develop suitable Key Performance Indicators and assessment frameworks, including with a base line for the initial situation.\nIn order to achieve an enduring impact, the project should ensure long-term economically sustainable ecosystems. To be effective, it is important that the project, as appropriate, builds on previous work as well as complements and links to ongoing related initiatives. The long-term sustainable ecosystems should therefore, as appropriate, build on existing networks and/or platforms, and should involve the key stakeholders, covering most EU Member States and Associated Countries as well as a wide range of CCIs. Proposals should include an outline of the sustainable and adaptable economic model envisaged, but do not need to describe it in full detail.\nIn order to engage entities which are not part of the project consortium, such as important innovation support actors or CCIs, projects may award financial support to third parties. Such support can only be given in the form of grants.\nThe Commission estimates that a project duration of at least 5 years is appropriate, in order to be able to achieve the expected long-term impacts.\n[1] CCIs as defined in the European Parliament Resolution ‘A coherent EU policy for cultural and creative industries’: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016IP0486&from=EN\n[2] See for instance Open Method of Coordination report ‘ The role of public policies in developing entrepreneurial and innovation potential of the cultural and creative sectors ’\n[3] Including projects funded under the call topics HORIZON-CL2-2021-HERITAGE-01-03, HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-04, HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-05, HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-06, HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-09, HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-02-01, HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-02, HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-06, HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-02, HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-03, HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-04, HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-05, HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-06.\n[4] https://www.eit.europa.eu/eit-community/eit-culture-creativity\n[5] https://pact-for-skills.ec.europa.eu/about/industrial-ecosystems-and-partnerships/creative-and-cultural-industries_en",

This hub will facilitate collaboration among a strong and open network of CCSI networks, professionals, researchers, AI tech companies, creative startups, ethical AI experts, rights management infrastructures, other industries with a shared interest in the field of AI for culture and creativity and a focus on research and innovation.\n- The AI4Creatives Support Platform provides easy access to shared services, expertise, capacity building, training, and tools needed to design, develop and adopt AI solutions tailored to cultural and creative processes and needs, enhancing innovation and competitiveness.\n- Filling a gap, the platform enables the development and sharing of AI applications that adhere to EU values, principles and regulations, implementing transparency, ethical standards, promoting cultural diversity, addressing biases, and ensuring equitable access to culture and creativity.",
      "scope": "This topic addresses the pressing need to coordinate, support, disseminate and capitalise on relevant outcomes from Horizon Europe Cluster 2-funded projects aimed to equip CCSI to leverage the digital transformation, from other relevant Horizon Europe projects, and from initiatives exploring AI in relation to CCSI under other EU programmes, such as the AI Continent Action Plan, (including AI Factories, GenAI4EU, Apply AI and the envisaged AI strategy for cultural and creative sectors and industries), AI Innovation package, and others. The aim is maximising their impact and driving innovation and competitiveness.\nAI offers significant opportunities for CCSI, but challenges persist, including skill gaps, limited interaction with technology partners, structural weaknesses of CCSI, mostly small and micro enterprises with weak bargaining power against big tech providers, and limited resources to train dedicated AI models. Other challenges relate to AI ethics, transparency and intellectual property rights, including copyright. By transcending siloed approaches and establishing synergies, CCSI can take advantage of economies of scale, harness AI's potential and drive innovation. The goal is establishing a permanent, networked reference point for CCSI through a virtual support platform that builds capacity and facilitates networking and collaboration among CCSI, stakeholders, researchers, technology developers, AI ethicists, and other industries and startups, with the overall aim to enable artists, cultural professionals, creative companies and cultural organisations to engage with AI, including dealing with biases and risks. The Support Platform is expected to enable the CCSI to access and utilize available custom-made tools, quality data, resources, knowledge, training, and AI applications aligned with their specific needs and with EU principles and regulations, thus easing the adoption of appropriate innovative ethical solutions and approaches tailored to the CCSI. Among the possible functions of the Support Platform should be:\n- Disseminate or develop frameworks, standards, best practices, and toolkits serving as strategic guidance for integrating ethical AI into CCSI value chains.\n- Facilitate cross-sector collaboration, synergies, and partnerships between CCSI professionals, AI tech companies, and startups, liaising with initiatives like the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), AI Factories, research infrastructures on cultural heritage and digital humanities, European Digital Innovation Hubs, ALT EDIC and LLMs4EU, Common European Data Space for Cultural heritage and other data spaces, and other EU initiatives in this area.\n- Build and develop a solid copyright infrastructure to support the use and licensing of copyright-protected content in the context of AI.\n- Suggest education and training frameworks and provide training to foster effective AI use in CCSI. Encourage CCSI and SMEs to engage with available federated data sources, digital infrastructures, computational resources, other available platforms to develop their own AI-powered products and services.\n- Develop a roadmap for emerging challenges in AI and other emerging technologies related to culture and creativity.\n- Engage in policy dialogues with policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders to emphasize culture's contribution to quality, ethical, and fair AI developments.\nThe platform is expected to develop and operate based on a robust sustainability and business model, ensuring long-term viability beyond the initial project phase. The business model should align with the platform’s objectives, ensuring it remains accessible to diverse organisations in terms of size and resources and that funding is not dominated by special interest groups.\nThe project should liaise with the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity to establish synergies, exchange information, and enhance mutual outcomes and impact. It should build on Horizon Europe funded projects in the area of AI and CCSI, particularly those funded under topics HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-04: Leveraging artificial intelligence for creativity-driven innovation, HORIZON-CL2-2026-01-HERITAGE-03: AI integration in CCSI work practice: catalysing innovation and competitiveness, HORIZON-CL2-2026-01-HERITAGE-04: Towards a fair and transparent market for cultural and creative content in the era of generative AI, and establish synergies with relevant projects, and initiatives supported by other relevant EU programmes, such as Digital Europe, Creative Europe and their successors. The project should conduct a pilot of the virtual platform to ensure alignment with CCSI needs, assessing technical and operational feasibility to ensure sustainability over time. The virtual Support Platform should be fully operational by the project's conclusion.",

      "scope": "The transition from a linear to a circular economy [2] is crucial for Europe’s prosperity, long term competitiveness and strategic autonomy. This shift can reduce dependence on raw materials, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and waste, limit biodiversity loss, create jobs, and support environmental sustainability. The New European Innovation Agenda [3] recognises circularity as a key challenge to accelerate innovation across the EU. Securing essential resources is a high priority, but the transition to circularity requires more than new materials and products: it demands a paradigm shift and a systemic approach that combines different sectors, technological progress, actors, and disciplines with deeper industrial, economic, and societal changes. In advancing a circular economy and society, cultural dimensions are paramount; and cultural barriers can be as significant as economic or technical ones and should be addressed.\nCCSIs can act as catalysts for change. Through storytelling and community engagement, they can reshape cognitive frameworks, influence consumer attitudes, and promote societal shifts towards circular principles. They can encourage other industries, such as manufacturing (including textile and fashion), tourism, or construction (including housing and urban development) to adopt circular approaches, promoting resource efficiency and designing for longevity and adaptability. Despite their potential, cultural aspects remain underexplored in circular economy strategies. This topic aims to investigate effective strategies and synergies between culture, creativity, and the circular economy, to inform policy, enhance education and lifelong learning, and inspire innovation. The goal is to develop robust frameworks supporting economic, environmental, and social sustainability across Europe, fostering an environment where culture, creativity, and economy combine to form resilient circular systems and societies. Where relevant, synergies with the New European Bauhaus may also be considered.\nProposals may address one or more of the following four focuses and may combine them with others as appropriate to their objectives.\nFocus 1. Crafts-led innovation for circular economy\nCrafts naturally align with circular economy principles through their use of natural, renewable materials, small scale tools and production, and the creation of durable products with cultural significance. Integrating circular economy concepts with craftsmanship helps address sustainability challenges, preserve cultural heritage and foster local economic development. Craft practices exemplify frugal innovation by efficiently using local resources and minimising waste, offering valuable insights for other sectors seeking to improve sustainability and resource efficiency. Key aspects of the relationship between crafts and the circular economy include traditional knowledge systems rooted in generations of sustainable, place-based practices; local resource utilisation promoting efficiency; and upcycling and waste reduction through creative reuse of materials.\nFurthermore, craftmanship is key part of the value chain in high-end industries such as fashion and textiles, with potential synergies to enhance sustainability and the use of recycled, reused and renewable materials and to foster circular and just fashion and textiles value-chains, supporting innovative approaches.\nBy leveraging circular economy and frugal innovation principles, craft practices offer affordable, accessible, inclusive and equitable solutions to sustainability challenges, emphasizing local resources and community-based production.\nCollaborative, open innovation approaches can unlock creative solutions that promote a more sustainable, inclusive, and resource-efficient future.\nProposals should develop a framework integrating circular economy and frugal innovation principles derived from craft practices, applicable and adaptable across various industries and sectors. This includes models for cross-sector collaboration and knowledge transfer among craft practitioners, designers, researchers, and industry professionals to drive circular innovation, foster capacity building, and ensure equitable access to sustainable solutions.\nProposals may consider UNESCO Creative Cities, in particular the City of Crafts and Folk Arts.\nFocus 2 Evaluating adaptive reuse of built cultural heritage\nCultural heritage buildings are vital for their historical and cultural significance, embodying the identity of local communities. At the same time, the built environment is a major driver of material demand, with significant economic, environmental and wellbeing impacts. [4] The Built4People SRIA [5] highlights the need for R&I in retrofitting and repair, including heritage buildings, using vernacular, bio-based, locally sourced materials, or innovative materials compatible with vernacular ones. The EU Circular Cities and Regions Initiative identifies adaptive reuse of cultural heritage as key to urban sustainability and resilience. [6] There is a need for systematic urban planning transforming building lifecycles from linear to circular models, leveraging cultural heritage to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and generate cultural, economic, social and environmental benefits. Participatory planning is crucial for achieving circularity, as are indicators for measuring impact. Adaptive reuse also delivers economic value as heritage sites attract visitors, support local businesses, and foster vibrant cultural economies, making cultural participation central to sustainable urban regeneration and the circular economy. Integrating service design approaches can further connect adaptive reuse of heritage buildings with stakeholders and enhance cultural services and community activities.\nProposals should develop methodologies to evaluate the economic, social and environmental benefits of maintaining and reusing built heritage. They should establish criteria and indicators for assessing cultural heritage’s contribution to circular city objectives, including energy and resource efficiency, waste reduction, social cohesion and economic sustainability, and explore evaluation tools for innovative circular financing, business and governance models for adaptive reuse of cultural heritage.\nFocus 3. Food heritage and gastronomic innovation for circular futures\nFood is deeply connected to cultural and creative sectors through gastronomic heritage, food-related crafts, and intangible traditions that shape cultural identities. Addressing food’s cultural dimensions offers unique opportunities to advance circular economy principles. Food heritage promotes local sourcing, biodiversity, and waste reduction, while culinary tourism and creative food initiatives drive sustainable growth and cross-sectoral innovation. Proposals should develop a framework to integrate circular economy principles into gastronomy and food heritage and devise transferable methodologies linking food-related creativity with sustainable practices. Proposals might consider UNESCO Creative Cities, in particular the City of Gastronomy.\nFocus 4. Designing circularity: creative pathways and open innovation\nDesign is pivotal in the transition to a circular economy, underpinning three principles: eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials, and regenerating nature. By applying these principles, designers create durable, repairable, and recyclable products and services, aligned with circular economy goals. The fashion industry pioneered upcycling and make-to-order models, producing items only on demand to reduce overproduction and waste. Such models, alongside product-as-a-service, sharing economy initiatives, or closed-loop production systems, offer adaptable strategies for other sectors to enhance circularity. The dynamic creative sector catalyses innovation, serving as a platform to experiment with circular design approaches across creative and non-creative sectors, including open innovation practices.\nProposals should develop a comprehensive framework for integrating circular economy principles into design processes across cultural and creative industries, guiding designers to minimise waste and maximise resource efficiency. A collaborative environment should facilitate sharing circular design practices and transferring innovative solutions across industries.\n[1] “The frugal innovation process is a problem-oriented, creative approach to problem solving which starts from user needs and works from the bottom up to develop contextually appropriate solutions. It tends to be frugal both in ends and means,” Study on frugal innovation and reengineering of traditional techniques,2017 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/20d6095a-2a44-11e7-ab65-01aa75ed71a1 , see also https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/639c142b-f260-11ef-981b-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[2] “The circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is extended. In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum.”\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20151201STO05603/circular-economy-definition-importance-and-benefits\n[3] The New European Innovation Agenda - European Commission\n[4] http://unep.org/resources/Global-Resource-Outlook-2024\n[5] https://www.kowi.de/Portaldata/2/Resources/heu/coop/he-built4people-sria-2022-27.pdf\n[6] https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/support-materials/papers-and-reports .

      "scope": "It is widely recognised that cultural experiences, such as those offered by cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) or cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI), can be beneficial for health and well-being. Research done, though scattered and not always systematic, supports this conclusion, with for instance the World Health Organisation arguing that cultural experiences contribute to health in four areas: prevention of ill-health, promotion of healthy behaviour, as well as management and treatment of disease [2] .\nHowever, there is still a lack of systematic research into the key characteristics and circumstances of cultural experiences to best support health and well-being. The challenge is to remedy this situation by developing evidence-based and validated practices that can be understood and used by CHIs and CCSI as well as other key stakeholders to develop cultural experiences that effectively support health and well-being.\nThere are many possible ways to approach this challenge. Proposals are free to choose the focus considered to have the best potential to achieve a strong impact and should make sure to delimit the focus in a way that allows for sufficiently thorough work. Activities may thus concentrate on different kinds of arts and culture – interventions and/or experiences – online and/or in person – and/or on cross-sectoral issues. Proposals should, however, credibly explain why the chosen focus and approach are likely to achieve a strong impact.\nOne possible focus could be on arts and culture-based experiences as a societal support kit, in situations of crises or other circumstances where health or well-being is under threat. Decision-makers could thus benefit from a set of validated practices that help support well-being among the population in such situations. Such research might be based on good examples provided by Member States/Associated Countries or other stakeholders, with a view to consolidate and build on existing knowledge and practices.\nAnother possible focus could be on mobilising a particular cultural and creative industry to contribute to health and well-being, such as for instance the video games industry. Ever more people spend ever more time on games, making this an important and growing source of cultural experiences, with a strong interactive component. Besides being a source of entertainment, video game communities give opportunities for isolated, underprivileged or discriminated people to find a sense of belonging, and to contribute to societal goals. At the same time, however, a context of competitivity and anonymity may invite harassment and discrimination in online multi-player video games.\nA third possible focus could be an implementation research approach, exploring the obstacles to adoption of already validated arts and culture –based intervention(s) that support health and well-being, and developing effective way(s) to achieve broad uptake.\nIn order to achieve evidence-based and validated practices that can be understood and used by CHIs and/or CCSI as well as by other targeted key actors and stakeholders, projects should involve stakeholders from such sectors. To validate practices, projects may launch small scale pilot trials but may also choose other validation methods appropriate to the focus chosen. As appropriate for the focus chosen, projects should properly take the gender dimension into account, such as for instance gender differences in cultural participation and its consequences. Projects may award financial support to third parties in order to involve entities such as CCSI, CHIs or other important stakeholders which are not part of the project consortium. Such support can only be given in the form of grants.\nTo the extent appropriate, projects should build on previous research and innovation and established methods. In particular, as appropriate, projects may establish links to the project funded under call topic ‘HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-09 Impacts of Culture and the Arts on Health and Well-being’.\nProposals may consider, as appropriate considering the focus chosen, the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), based on its experience for example with the SciArt and artist-in-residency programmes, and the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and policymaking.\n[1] ‘Health and well-being’ should in the context of this topic be understood in a comprehensive sense, comprising both mental and physical health and well-being.\n[2] See the 2019 WHO Scoping review “ What is the evidence on the role of the arts in improving health and well-being ?”",

      "scope": "The intersection of social economy[[ The European Commission defines social economy in the Communication ‘ Building an economy that works for people: an action plan for the social economy ’, COM(2021) 778 final, p. 5 \"The social economy covers entities sharing the following main common principles and features: the primacy of people as well as social and/or environmental purpose over profit, the reinvestment of most of the profits and surpluses to carry out activities in the interest of members/users (“collective interest”) or society at large (“general interest”) and democratic and/or participatory governance. Traditionally, the term social economy refers to four main types of entities providing goods and services to their members or society at large: cooperatives, mutual benefit societies, associations (including charities), and foundations.” […]]] and the cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI) provides fertile ground for advancing sustainable and inclusive development across public and private domains. Enhancing synergies between private initiatives (impact-oriented enterprises, cooperatives, associations) and public policy can unlock innovative models, fostering hybrid approaches that blend public mission with entrepreneurial strategies. Studies highlight the role of social economy entities in CCSI for local development through ecological approaches, territorial clustering, and community engagement, as well as for improving employment and working conditions and promoting inclusive growth [1] .\nThe European Commission’s 2021 Action Plan for the social economy, complemented by the EU Social Economy Gateway [2] , and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) underscore the CCSI potential for economic growth, job creation, and innovation. The OECD further notes that integrating social economy models in culture and creativity can stabilise employment, improve working conditions in creative industries, which often face precarious employment and limited access to credit, and foster sustainability, innovation and social cohesion [3] . In April 2023, the UN General Assembly recognised the social economy as critical to inclusive and sustainable economies [4] .\nEmbracing social economy principles in CCSI can address major societal challenges such as income inequality and social cohesion, while driving culture- and creativity-led innovation and inclusive growth across Europe.\nReimagining the creative economy requires CCSIs to engage with broader societal and economic frameworks. This topic aims to enhance the transformative potential of CCSIs’ interplay with the social economy in Europe. Proposals are expected to investigate, develop, and test innovative frameworks and models that leverage social economy principles in culture and creativity to drive social impact, economic sustainability, quality jobs creation, and vibrant, resilient cultural and creative sectors. By moving beyond traditional market logics and adopting cooperative, participatory and socially oriented models, proposals will identify scalable strategies for ethical business, revenue diversification, and embedding social purpose in creative innovation. This may include developing technical or legal assistance and support services enabling CCSIs to access shared resources, enhance resilience, and build community capital. These efforts will empower CCSIs to catalyse inclusive, sustainable transformation and position Europe as a leader in a fairer creative economy.\nKey areas of focus are expected to be addressed through inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary approaches (taking into account – among others – contributions by SSH disciplines), including cross-sectoral cooperation and stakeholder involvement:\n1. Sustainable Growth and Quality Employment\n- Analyse social economy models’ impact on CCSI sustainability, resilience, and growth, particularly during crises.\n- Examine how social economy principles address precarious employment, support alternative employment, and foster professional development, while contributing to creative entrepreneurial ecosystems for regional development that strengthen local economies.\n- Explore financing mechanisms, fiscal incentives and solutions to sector-specific challenges, to incentivize social reinvestment.\n- Investigate how social economy enterprises address socio-economic diversity, income inequality, inclusivity, and promote innovation including within CCSIs. [5]\n2. Innovation, local development and social impact\n- Investigate how CCSI social enterprises drive innovation (including social innovation), social participation, and empower marginalized groups and groups in vulnerable situations, such as persons with disabilities.\n- Highlight social entrepreneurship’s role in catalysing new business models and value-driven practices addressing societal challenges\n- Assess CCSI social economy enterprises contribution to local development, social cohesion, and responsible consumption.\n3. Policy and comparative studies\n- Analyse and compare policy frameworks supporting the convergence of creative economy and social economy models in the EU and beyond.\nIdentify best practices and propose recommendations for integrated strategies enhancing sustainable, inclusive development and innovation.\n[1] Among others, A.

      "scope": "Cultural tourism accounts for about 40% of global tourism [1] and continues to grow as travellers seek unique, authentic, and immersive experiences. In addition to its economic benefits, cultural tourism enriches societies through cultural exchange and cross-cultural understanding. The sector faces major transformation driven by technological advancement, shifting consumer expectations, climate change, sustainability imperatives, environmental degradation and threats to cultural integrity – including commodification and heritage degradation. Furthermore, there is a growing emphasis on inclusive and meaningful travel experiences, including accessibility for travellers with disabilities and others with specific needs. This topic takes a multidimensional approach to future-proofing sustainable cultural tourism amid technological, social and environmental change across the EU and beyond. Proposals should select either Focus 1 or Focus 2 and clearly state their selection:\nFocus 1: Transformative AI integration and strategic foresight for cultural tourism resilience\nProposals are expected to explore how integrating AI-powered tools and other emerging technologies with cultural tourism can strengthen its resilience, inclusivity, and sustainability. Additionally, through AI-assisted participatory foresight proposals should address the need for tourism systems to move from reactive management to anticipatory governance models, building resilience to global challenges.\nProposals should investigate AI applications that reshape cultural tourism experiences while ensuring that they remain authentic and respectful of local integrity; enhance inclusivity, including equal access to technology and improved accessibility for persons with disabilities; help manage visitor pressure. They could leverage available public and private data and infrastructures, such as the European Data space for Tourism. [2] Building on recent developments in AI and immersive technologies, proposals could for example use AI-powered virtual and augmented reality to boost visitor engagement and cross-cultural appreciation of cultural sites while preserving historical integrity. They should investigate novel approaches to AI-driven personalisation that develop inclusive, non-discriminatory, tailored cultural experiences, which are ethically managed, and ensure fair representation of minority or lesser-known heritage and cultural expressions.\nProposals could analyse the integration of AI in multilingual interpretation and cultural mediation to overcome language barriers and deepen cultural understanding of local contexts or develop and refine AI-powered tools for visitor flow management, real-time heritage monitoring, and balancing preservation with inclusive tourism.\nFurthermore, proposals are expected to develop methodological frameworks for applying AI-assisted foresight (scenario planning, horizon scanning, among others to anticipate trends and challenges in cultural tourism – such as shifts in visitor behaviour, cultural commodification risks, and potential disruptions (eg related to climate, pandemics, energy crises), enabling the identification of opportunities and risks and fostering proactive, data-informed policy responses. AI-based predictive analytics should be combined with participatory workshops to engage local communities, authorities, and cultural organisations in co-creating forward-looking sustainable tourism strategies.\nFocus 2: Cultural tourism as a catalyst for sustainable local development\nProposals are expected to develop sustainable cultural tourism frameworks and strategies tailored to emerging and less-developed destinations, especially in low-income and lesser-known regions seeking to leverage culture and creativity for economic growth and social development, including through addressing depopulation and preventing overtourism. These frameworks may foster creative entrepreneurial ecosystems for regional development. Partnerships with non-EU countries are encouraged. Proposals should investigate cross-border collaboration models that enable mutual learning, upskilling, fair working conditions, knowledge transfer and capacity building between EU and non-EU partners. Proposals should identify and adapt proven sustainable cultural tourism models to diverse less-developed settings (urban, peri-urban, rural) emphasizing equitable benefit-sharing. The research should include the analysis of case studies of successful community integration in cultural tourism decision-making. Partnerships among local communities, creative industries (including crafts), local businesses and cultural heritage organisations should be prioritised to co-create economically viable, environmentally balanced, authentic and culturally respectful tourism offerings, potentially using living labs and pilot demonstrations. Projects are expected to establish collaborative networks for small businesses and civil society actors in cultural tourism, supporting them through access to researchers, policymakers, expertise, knowledge, resources and collaborative opportunities.\nRegardless of focus, all proposals should ensure cooperation with and policy uptake of existing knowledge, tools, and best practices from past and ongoing EU-funded research on cultural tourism and related areas [3] . They should develop frameworks integrating cultural tourism with broader sustainability, digital transformation, and social inclusion goals. Furthermore, they should create co-creative policy development methodologies involving diverse stakeholders (policymakers across various government levels, local communities, NGOs, businesses, industry) to translate research insights into evidence-based strategies and contextually appropriate interventions boosting cultural tourism as a resource for sustainable development and fostering workforce growth and skills, and improved working conditions in cultural tourism. Finally, they should establish continuous knowledge exchange mechanisms among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to ensure ongoing relevance and impact.\n[1] UN World Tourism Organization (2018), Tourism and Culture Synergies , p. 21.\nhttps://www.e-unwto.org/doi/epdf/10.18111/9789284418978\n[2] https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/calls-proposals/data-space-tourism_en\n[3] This includes projects funded by Cluster 6 topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-2-two-stage: New sustainable business and production models for farmers and rural communities.",

      "scope": "Heritage is a dynamic resource that can foster societal resilience, intercultural dialogue, and a sense of belonging in increasingly diverse and fragmented societies. It can contribute to social cohesion and resilience through arts, design and cultural practices. Thus, cultural heritage is central to the preservation of the social fabric and community cohesion. Understanding and amplifying the societal impact of cultural heritage is essential for reinforcing identity, cohesion, and global leadership based on shared values. Research proposals should explore how cultural heritage actively shapes civic engagement, social innovation, collective memory, and the transmission of democratic values.\nMoreover, it is crucial to develop new narratives around heritage — ones that are forward-looking, critically aware, and deeply connected to Europe's evolving values. Such work will not only strengthen Europe's internal cohesion but also position cultural heritage as a strategic asset in addressing global challenges.\nIn this context, social innovation could also translate into working with cultural heritage practitioners and custodians to explore how cultural heritage can solve some of today's societal challenges (achieving better social inclusion, social cohesion, well-being, and equality). Whereas previous research (including contributions by SSH disciplines) has widely explored developing heritage-based education, contribution of culture to rural development and cultural tourism, there are some fields that could benefit from more research: cultural participation and access to culture, with a focus on young people; gender roles and identities; a shared cultural heritage and shared responsibility in the light of security challenges.\nResearch projects should choose one of the following areas:\nA. Cultural participation and access to cultural heritage\nAccess to culture, acquired through socialisation and education, plays a crucial role in shaping cultural practices and preferences. As mentioned in the Political Guidelines [1] for the European Commission, there is a need to improve access to cultural heritage, in particular for young people, and contribute to tackle cultural inequality and strengthen a sense of identity and belonging. In addition, attention should be paid to disadvantaged groups, eventually solidifying participatory culture and democracy and fostering a sense of stewardship towards cultural heritage.\nA Special Eurobarometer on Europeans’ Attitudes Towards Culture [2] , published in May 2025, showed that a majority of Europeans believe that their country and the EU should work more closely together when it comes to making arts and culture more accessible to everyone.\nPrior research [3] indicates that increased cultural participation can potentially enhance civic engagement, social inclusion, and democratic governance, and counteract alienation and social disengagement. However, research also indicates profound and multifaceted barriers to access. These barriers include, for example, geography, including the challenge of rural isolation; under-representation of minority groups; economic disparity.\nThe proposals should explore good practices for fostering access to cultural heritage, with a focus on young people and ways to empower them to take an active role in their communities and strengthen social cohesion. Proposals should also explore which are the main barriers for access to culture and effective means to increase cultural participation, identifying specificities for different types of groups.\nThe proposals should employ interdisciplinary and participatory methods to identify effective models for inclusive cultural participation. Results are expected to guide policies on cultural access, with recommendations, for instance, for digital infrastructure, educational programmes, and cross-sector collaboration to foster inclusive citizenship.\nB. Gender roles and identities\nCultural heritage has the power to promote diversity and inclusion by showcasing diverse narratives and histories, but it can also perpetuate inequality if stereotypes, cultural role models, and representations are limited or biased, silencing marginalised voices.\nThe proposed research should explore the complex relationships between cultural productions, representations and societal attitudes towards different sexes and gender identities, with a focus on understanding how culture can shape our cultural landscape and influence our attitudes and imaginaries.\nProposals should provide an analysis of the representation and overview of different gender identities and intersecting factors such as racial or ethnical background, disability or socioeconomic background, in cultural fields. Proposals should explore how gender aspects have been absent, or forgotten, in major supranational cultural narratives. Proposals should provide actionable recommendations on how to promote a more inclusive and diverse representation, including in the cultural content, and to address the absence of diverse representations in the cultural field. These recommendations should be developed in a dialogue with different stakeholders, for example researchers, policymakers, cultural heritage institutions, civil society representatives.\nC. Cultural heritage, cohesion and security\nThe proposed research should explore the role and conceptualisation of cultural heritage as a distinctive element of our shared identities and democratic values. It should also examine the links between culture and security including issues of disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI) etc. Proposals are expected to explore the notions of shared heritage and shared responsibility as an expression of our social interdependence, and culture as a factor of union and cohesion.\nCases of instrumentalisation of cultural heritage and the political influence on museums or other cultural institutions should also be taken into account in the research. Culture can also face factors of destabilisation, attacks on cultural heritage can destabilise society and jeopardize security while cultural content can greatly influence public opinion and the imaginaries. The proposals should explore how to deal with polarising narratives and controversial aspects of cultural heritage use.\nThe proposals should propose good practices, policy guidelines, run pilot projects and propose didactic materials to raise awareness on existing challenges, enhance “neutrality” in cultural heritage management, collective responsibility and cultural resilience; explore the notions of care and repair applied to cultural heritage.\nProposals shall clearly indicate the thematic area they have selected to work on.\nProposals should adopt a multidisciplinary approach (involving, for instance and not exhaustively, heritage and museum studies, cultural anthropology, ethnology, media studies, theatre studies, literary studies, musicology etc.) to assess and demonstrate how cultural heritage initiatives contribute to societal well-being, community empowerment, inclusion, and sustainable development while identification of needs for further research in the field should be promoted.\nProposals should prioritize empirical research, participatory methodologies, and policy innovation to maximize and communicate the transformative power of cultural heritage across all layers of society.\nProposals should connect to both formal and non-formal education, particularly arts education. Encouraging collaboration between cultural heritage actors and educational institutions would enhance impact.\nProposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, networks and platforms, notably the ones funded by the EU, for example paying attention to the future digital tools and platforms provided by the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), and the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage.\nFurthermore, links should be established and complementarities sought with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020.\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en?filename=Political%20Guidelines%202024-2029_EN.pdf\n[2] https://culture.ec.europa.eu/news/eurobarometer-publishes-findings-on-europeans-attitudes-towards-culture\n[3] Culture and democracy, the evidence - Publications Office of the EU",

      "scope": "Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) refers to ‘the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills—as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces’ that are ‘transmitted from generation to generation’ and are ‘constantly recreated’ – as defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH Convention) [1] . ICH is an essential part of a community's identity and is a vital component of its cultural and biological diversity.\nThe ICH Convention was adopted in 2003, by 148 countries and it recognizes the importance of ICH as a driving force for social cohesion, cultural diversity, and sustainable development.\nHowever, the nature of ICH, as living heritage, to continually transform and evolve, makes it particularly challenging to keep alive. Therefore, safeguarding ICH encounters very different challenges than the built heritage sector. ICH is rooted in territories and communities and is essential for identity building and maintaining social cohesion and a harmonious relation to the natural environment. It is a source for creativity and innovation, and a critical factor for new competitive scenarios.\nTransmission, education and intergenerational dialogue play a key role in this context, and there is an urgent need to research and foster participatory approaches, especially involving oral cultures and transmission. Different case-studies should explore various approaches to the safeguarding of ICH, considering the specific nature of competences, knowledge and cultural practices of creators and knowledge holders, with a focus on intergenerational transmission.\nProposals should contribute to defining the specificities of intangible cultural heritage. Additionally, they could examine and quantify the contribution of ICH to creativity, innovation, cultural and biological diversity, and economic benefits. Proposals should also contribute to the rethinking of cultural policies for the safeguarding of ICH including exploring links and correlations between cultural and biological diversity.\nProposed research projects could address in depth the following research questions:\n- What is the state of play of the safeguarding of ICH in Europe, following the UNESCO 2003 Convention?\n- What are the main threats and challenges to the erosion and loss of ICH in Europe?\n- What are the most effective strategies for securing ICH safeguarding initiatives?\n- How can advanced digital technologies be leveraged for the safeguarding & transmission of ICH?\n- How can ICH provide inspiration for innovative approaches to existing societal challenges (e.g. competitiveness, intergenerational dialogue democratic values, biodiversity protection and restoration [2] )\n- What role can community-led initiatives play in safeguarding ICH, and how can communities be supported and empowered to safeguard it?\nThe role of advanced digital technologies to support ICH safeguarding and transmission should be considered, as appropriately.\nThe proposals should comprise transdisciplinary scientific collaborations involving, for instance and not exhaustive, heritage and museum studies, cultural anthropology, ethnology, media studies, theatre studies, literary studies, musicology etc. Available results of existing research on intangible cultural heritage should be taken into consideration, while identification of needs for further research in the field should be promoted.\nProposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, networks and platforms, notably the ones funded by the EU, for example paying attention to the future digital tools and platforms provided by the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), and the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage.\nFurthermore, links should be established and complementarities sought with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, proposals should establish links to, and where appropriate build on findings from, projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL2-2025-HERITAGE-02: Innovative approaches to intangible cultural heritage for societal resilience.\n[1] https://ich.unesco.org/en/convention\n[2] As defined in the EU Nature Restoration Regulation https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/nature-and-biodiversity/nature-restoration-regulation_en .",

      "scope": "Proposals should focus on exploring and better understanding the relationships between access to quality green and/or blue spaces in the pursuit of social and environmental justice, community cohesion and overall social fabric. Proposals may also look at how to support fair transitions to climate-resilient communities from a climate adaptation and biodiversity perspective, ensuring a link to cohesion and social resilience. Targets, notably for urban ecosystem restoration, under the EU Nature Restoration Regulation [1] should be taken into account. Synergies with the EU Urban Agenda may also be considered.\nResearch to date has largely focused on the benefits of nature on individuals (e.g., improved health, reduced stress), while more and up-to-date knowledge is needed on their effects at a societal level and across cultural, geographical and socioeconomic contexts as well as the range of functional needs of different groups.\nThis topic aims to bridge the knowledge gaps surrounding a fair and equitable relationship between social groups and the environment, in particular the link between nature-as a public good and its role in fostering civic engagement that cultivates social cohesion, community wellbeing, shared identity and sense of belonging and place-making.\nStudies show that disadvantaged communities have fewer and lower-quality green and/or blue spaces, but less is known about the mechanisms through which access to nature-positive spaces strengthens cultural identities (at the individual and group levels), cohesion and resilience, particularly in lower-income communities and across generations.\nProposals may explore:\n- The community-level impacts of initiatives aiming to introduce green and/or blue spaces and an understanding of how intentional design and planning can help improve societal outcomes throughout the community, with special attention to how socially vulnerable groups may be impacted, which types of natural spaces are used for which activities and what distance constitutes 'accessible' or sufficient to promote social contact. When considering the notion of access to quality green and blue spaces, researchers should consider not only the physical distance to these spaces, but other barriers such as the state of desolation of public green and/or blue spaces, privatisation, as well as cultural, social, economic barriers to access nature.\n- Knowledge gaps around the long-term impacts of lack of access to quality green and/or blue spaces, and how this amplifies existing socioeconomic inequalities, in particular the intersection with other determining factors of sociopsychological and mental wellbeing such as age, education, employment, housing, health, mobility and socioeconomic status, including aspects around ease of access, affordability and capacity to empower communities, particularly among vulnerable groups (such as marginalised urban communities, including migrants and informal settlements).\n- The role that community-based projects – for example those aimed at social participation and inclusion, environmental preservation, circular economy and food security, and preserving natural heritage (e.g., urban gardening, traditional ecological knowledge practices, rewilding, nature conservation, nature-based solutions and citizen science) – play in strengthening community agency, identity, place attachment, and sociopsychological, mental and material well-being and social capital.\n- The role of green and/or blue spaces in the mitigation of inequalities in pollution exposure, a source of concern in many disadvantaged communities.\n- The potential contributions of local businesses and social economy actors to the implementation of green and/or blue spaces, as well as the meaningful participation of individuals, representing different economic/labour sectors and collective identities within the community.\n- The contribution of nature to place-making and the ways in which approaches from the arts and humanities can contribute to how we understand place, and shape future places, in concert with local communities.\nProposals are expected to adopt a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach to analyse differential access to nature-positive environments across population groups. Particular attention should be paid to identifying the structural and systemic drivers of these disparities, as well as assessing the social, economic and health-related impacts of unequal access on individuals and communities.\nInterdisciplinary approaches (including from SSH disciplines), combining insights from sociology, anthropology, law, environmental philosophy and systems science, are encouraged. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this and past calls are strongly encouraged, in particular topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-06: ‘Assessing and modelling socio-economic impacts of nature restoration’, topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES-01-1: ‘Enhancing social inclusion in rural areas: focus on people in a vulnerable situation and social economy’ and topics under the New European Bauhaus (topic HORIZON-NEB-2026-01-PARTICIPATION-03: Understanding inhabitant’s experiences of neighbourhoods to support their health and well-being, and topic HORIZON-MISS-2027-07-CLIMA-CIT-NEB-01: Urban nature: supporting restoration of urban ecosystems, along urban transport networks and in the built environment). Participation by entities from cities that are signatories of the Green City Accord [2] is encouraged.

      "scope": "In-kind benefits refer to non-cash goods and services provided to individuals or households, typically by the government (national, regional and/or local), to support their well-being or fulfil basic needs. Unlike cash transfers, which can be spent at the recipient's discretion, in-kind benefits ensure that resources are used for specific purposes for free or at a subsidised cost (e.g. food banks, social housing, health and long-term care services, childcare, schooling, sport infrastructure, public transport). Despite the wide range of in-kind benefits, there is poor empirical knowledge basis of the impact of in-kind benefits (except for healthcare) on the income distribution and on vulnerable groups, unlike the impact of cash benefits.\nResearch activities may focus, as a baseline, on establishing a full mapping of in-kind benefits (both for free and at a subsidised cost, universal and means-tested) provided by national, regional and local governments. This mapping, potentially structured along the life-cycle perspective and/or around specific groups, might help to develop EU indicators on in-kind benefits and improve comparability.\nProposals may develop a comprehensive measurement framework based on methods, tools, available data and indicators, both qualitative and quantitative and both ex ante and ex post. The framework may translate in-kind benefits into income and show their redistributive role (on income groups, vulnerable populations, marginal and/or small size groups) and ensure cross-country comparability.\nProposals may consider identifying the availability of in-kind benefits at local level, potential gaps, take-up rates for in-kind benefits and their reasons (e.g. capacities' incompatibility with the local needs). They may involve vulnerable communities in the evaluation design.\nProposals may provide operational advice to policy makers on how to translate the research results into concrete actions to reduce inequality and strengthen fairness and cohesion.\nThe overall aim is to close the knowledge gap covering various dimensions. Therefore, it is expected that proposals apply a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach, including age, to their research.",

      "scope": "The European Union is committed to fostering a social market economy that promotes sustainable growth, social justice, and economic competitiveness. In this context, the social economy has emerged as a potential driver of innovation, job creation, and social inclusion. On the other hand, there is still a persistent knowledge gap in the literature when it comes to appreciate the multifaceted contribution social economy actors make in shaping and advancing economic competitiveness within and across the EU society and its impact on inclusive wellbeing and the environment (for example, the prevention of environmental degradation or loss of biodiversity [2] ).\nSustainable competitiveness and shared prosperity are key a political priority of the new European Commission [3] . In this context, the notion of sustainable competitiveness is less about relative labour cost and more about skills, innovation, entrepreneurship and adaptation. It focuses on the ability for an individual, a firm, a sector, or a country to increase shared prosperity in relation to the current and future environment and society.\nThe link between social economy and sustainable competitiveness relies on innovation, which needs to be made broader, going beyond “mere” technological innovation and embrace social or even better societal innovation.\nProposals should focus on exploring the potential virtuous relationships between social economy, sustainable competitiveness and shared prosperity.\nResearch (including from SSH disciplines) should focus on a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the sustainable competitiveness of social economy entities on one side and, on the other, its possible impact on EU sustainable competitiveness. This requires addressing knowledge gaps, such as the lack of a comprehensive framework to measure the social economy's contribution to sustainable competitiveness in the European Union.\nResearch may undertake a review of existing literature, analysis and develop case studies to identify the key enabling factors that make social economy entities competitive in a sustainable way, while considering the social, economic, and environmental dimensions.\nTo better capture the role of the social economy as one of the drivers of sustainable competitiveness, the research may develop a framework to measure its contribution including with existing and new indicators and metrics.\nResearch may identify best practices, develop toolkit and policy recommendations on how social economy in Europe can boost public and private competitiveness linked to EU shared prosperity goals (such as well-being and nature preservation).\nThe regulatory context and its impact on the social economy's ability to contribute to sustainable competitiveness should be considered.\nActivities may involve interdisciplinary research, stakeholder engagement, and policy analysis. Researchers may need to draw on expertise from different fields (economics, sociology, environmental science, public administration) to develop a comprehensive understanding of the social economy's role in promoting sustainable competitiveness, in line with the EU Green Deal and in the Kunming Montreal Agreement..\nThe scope of this call topic is not limited to any specific sector, value chain or enabling factors, however, proposals may put emphasis on a specific one. Collaboration with stakeholders from the social economy, private sector, and public sector to develop a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between social economy and sustainable competitiveness is encouraged.\n[1] The social economy covers entities sharing the following main common principles and features: the primacy of people as well as social and/or environmental purpose over profit, the reinvestment of most of the profits and surpluses to carry out activities in the interest of members/users (“collective interest”) or society at large (“general interest”) and democratic and/or participatory governance. Traditionally, the term social economy refers to four main types of entities providing goods and services to their members or society at large: cooperatives, mutual benefit societies, associations (including charities), and foundations. They are private entities, independent of public authorities and with specific legal forms. Social enterprises are now generally understood as part of the social economy. The social economy (associations, cooperatives, mutual societies, foundations, and social enterprises) provides monetary and non-monetary services, impacting on European sustainable competitiveness. Social economy actors also have a different approach to their working environment due to the societal objectives of their employers and the democratic governance of their ecosystems.\n[2] Nature is an essential part of competitiveness. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has demonstrated that around 55% of the global GDP is generated by sectors moderately to highly dependent on nature. Around 72% of euro area companies are critically dependent on ecosystem services.\n[3] https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en?filename=Political%20Guidelines%202024-2029_EN.pdf",

      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Policymakers gain insights into the economic and social effects of worker mobility across the EU, including effects on wages, fiscal budgets, and social systems for both sending and receiving regions.\n- The benefits of mobility are maximised through actionable recommendations, which consider challenges such as demographic changes, regional effects, digitalisation and, to a suitable extent, further developments such as the green transition or adaptation to climate change (including its potential impact on the economic development and the attractiveness of regions) or the green transition and discussions around the accession of further countries to the EU and wider geopolitical instabilities.",
      "scope": "While the EU facilitates free movement as one of the four freedoms of the single market, the long-term social and economic dynamics and implications for both receiving and, especially, sending regions remain underexplored. These include not only direct effects on fiscal and social budgets but also more subtle impacts, such as on the networks, skills, and experiences that individuals bring back to their home regions, but also on the income distribution in the country from which the movers originate.\nGaining a deeper, data-supported understanding of these diverse often complex effects is crucial for shaping policies that effectively harness the benefits of mobility across Europe. In doing so the research shall contribute to the ongoing efforts of strengthening the internal market and make Europe more competitive, while also ensuring social fairness and delivering on the European Pillar of Social Rights, in particular with regard to fair working conditions and ensuring access to adequate income and social protection for all. For the variations across different groups (including - but not limited to - gender, age, level of qualification) could be explored. Harnessing the benefits of mobility is also to be seen in the wider context of the green and digital transitions, necessitating enhanced labour mobility to address skill mismatches and shortages and demographic challenges.\nProposals should build on relevant previous research (including from SSH disciplines), some of which has been conducted in previous Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 projects [1] . Proposals should have a clear focus. Quantitative approaches and/or econometrics should be part of the proposed methodology. Approaches which can capture developments over time, such as panel analysis, might thereby be of added value.\nProjects should analyse the effects of labour mobility on the functioning of social security systems (eventually differentiating between the different pillars of the social security systems, e.g. pension system, health, care, etc.) in countries of origin and destination and their coordination and/or provide research which fosters an informed debate on potential strategies for a future-proof and efficient EU-level social security coordination.\nBeyond that, the projects may:\n- Explore ways to improve the quantification of the volume of various forms [e.g. long-term movers, seasonal work and other forms of short-term mobility, postings, cross-border (tele-)work etc] of labour mobility and/or make available figures more comparable across Member States.\n- Develop economic models to assess the EU-level economic effects of labour mobility.\n- Pay attention to the ecological effects of labour mobility and link those with the socio-economic effects.\n- Analyse whether and in which way the composition of movers (e.g. skill-level, age structure, status in labour market, etc.) matters for the socio-economic effects observed in the countries/regions of origin/destination.\n- Provide a comparative analysis of intra-EU labour mobility with labour mobility in other world regions or to geographical mobility within Member States.\n- Develop and test a model to forecast labour mobility in different scenarios (e.g. making assumptions about the economic and social development in different parts of the EU).\n- Take an evidence-based position whether – and in which way - geographical mobility contributes to manage economic change (e.g. whether movers are more willing to work in another sector).\n- Analyse to which extent and under which conditions regions with net-outward mobility have benefited or can benefit – eventually in the longer run – from this mobility.\n- Investigate the economic and social differences between labour migration and labour mobility, the experience with EU enlargement might be used to analyse this.\n- Provide evidence on which policy instruments are most suitable to ensure a labour mobility which is not perceived as unfair (e.g linked to exploitation, social dumping etc.).\nThese aspects illustrate thematic areas which could contribute to the objective of developing a vision for the future of labour mobility in the European Union and to discuss how legal and institutional frameworks can be adapted to support mobility in a way that is both economically and socially beneficial. This includes modernising the coordination of social security and ensuring that policies reflect the realities of modern society and work arrangements.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] See e.g. HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-02 - The impact of spatial mobility on European demographics, society, welfare system and labour market; https://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/a9351b1c-4d31-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1.0001.03/DOC_1 ; https://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/d697ee14-77ad-11ea-a07e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.01/DOC_1 ; https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/727072 ; https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/794030",

      "scope": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in learning environments in pre-primary and primary education is rapidly growing. However, there is limited evidence on how AI can challenge and improve learning outcomes, enhance the teaching techniques and support the teaching profession and how automating administrative tasks helps teachers focus on pedagogy and teaching challenges. Most existing research is from extra-EU contexts, which significantly limits the transferability of findings to EU education and training systems and is often conducted on a limited number of participants and covering short-time spans, hindering the possibility of generalising its findings. Moreover, research on the implications of AI tools for equity and inclusion in education is lacking. There is also a need to better investigate the challenges that AI poses to teaching and learning as well as pupils’ well-being. AI is developed to increase human efficiency yet also comes with often unexpected risks and challenges, especially when being applied to child audiences.\nThe research (including through SSH disciplines) could explore how AI can enhance curricula, improve teaching methods, and personalise learning through adaptive technologies. It should also consider the developmental appropriateness of AI tools for young learners, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and social growth. Research on AI’s impact on early childhood education and its role in supporting foundational skills would be valuable. Additionally, the research should emphasise the aspect of teacher support, including how AI can assist with lesson planning, assessment, and feedback. It should also explore training programs to help educators use AI effectively. Finally, inclusivity and accessibility are key angles to consider, ensuring AI tools are suitable for all students, including those with disabilities or from diverse backgrounds, and promoting multilingual and multicultural education.\nLongitudinal studies are also needed, as current research is fragmented and looking at the short term. Proposals should focus on the need to understand long-term cognitive, social, and emotional impacts, which requires sustained, multi-year investigations. Furthermore, the role of media and digital tools requires attention. Proposals should consider the devices and platforms through which children encounter AI (for example robots, tablets, smartphones etc) and how these shape interactions and learning outcomes.\nRelevant research questions to address include:\n- How can AI-powered tools personalise learning experiences safely and effectively and support teachers in addressing diverse student needs?\n- What are the potential benefits and challenges of integrating AI into initial teacher education and continuous professional development programmes?\n- How can AI assist teachers in automating administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on pedagogy and student engagement?\n- What ethical considerations and potential risks, including in relation to wellbeing, should be taken into account when using AI in education to support teachers and students?\n- What is the typical profile of teachers who are currently using AI-powered tools and which uses and perceived gratifications motivate using AI-powered tool?\n- How can AI tools motivate children to learn?\n- How can AI-based interventions address learning gaps based on individual students’ needs (including disabilities) and learning styles?\n- What changes do educational programmes need to perform on a pedagogical level for the successful integration of AI?\n- What do teachers need to implement the use of AI safely and effectively?\nProposals can apply a variety of methods including rigorous experimental and/or quasi-experimental methods, but also experience sampling and general survey methods, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing AI tools or to test new AI tools. Proposals should evaluate the costs associated with the policy measures or programmes analysed. Proposals should look at different forms of AI tools, e.g. Generative AI, Intelligent Tutoring Systems etc. Proposals should also apply qualitative research methods to cover the ethical dimensions. Interdisciplinary approaches and close cooperation with educational institutions and educators are essential. Cooperation with media literacy organisations is encouraged. Clustering and cooperation among selected projects under this call topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nParticular attention should be paid to identifying and mitigating biases in AI systems to ensure equity and inclusion in education systems.",

      "scope": "Young people's mathematics, reading and science skills, as measured by large-scale international assessments such as the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), have significantly declined in Europe over the past 15 years. This applies both to the low and top levels of achievement. Reversing that trend is one of the fundamental objectives of the Union of Skills.\nWhile the research literature has well analysed the short-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the structural causes of the observed decline are still poorly understood. More in-depth research is necessary, using various data sources at national and international level. Several interrelated research questions remain to be addressed, such as:\n- How have changes in teaching methods, curriculum design, and assessment practices influenced the decline in mathematics, reading and science skills over time?\n- What role do digital distractions and shifts in reading habits from paper to digital devices play?\n- What is the role handwriting and drawing for cognitive development?\n- What is the link between acquisition of cognitive skills in maths, science and reading on the one hand and the socio-emotional skills, learning skills, self-regulation, school climate on the other.\n- To what extent does the increasing (also migration-related) heterogeneity of the students make it more difficult to organise learning at school?\n- How does parental involvement affect educational performance?\n- Do different levels of parental involvement affect educational performance?\n- What is the role of cultural institutions such as museums and libraries?\n- What is the combined impact of socio-economic background and gender on gaps in educational performance?\n- How do different levels of investment in public education, and teacher shortages and working conditions affect the educational performance of children?\nProposals should also take into account the perspective of young people and other relevant stakeholders as part of the data collection. Close cooperation with authorities and/or other institutions owning the data is essential and should be ensured.\nUnderstanding the causes of this decline is the pre-condition for analysing the causal impact of various remedial measures and identifying effective policies and programmes to improve young people’s skills in mathematics, reading and science. Proposals should apply experimental and/or quasi-experimental methods for their analysis and could complement them with qualitative research methods. Proposals should also evaluate the costs associated with the policy measures or programmes analysed. Interdisciplinary approaches, combining insights from economics, sociology, psychology, neurosciences and education sciences, and more generally, the social sciences and humanities (SSH), are encouraged.

      "scope": "The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [1] recognises the right to work for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others (Art. 27). However, only half of the 42.8 million persons with disabilities of working age in the EU is employed, this being translated into an employment gap in which only 51% of persons with disabilities are employed compared to 75% of persons without disabilities [2] . In addition, persons with disabilities are overrepresented among those inactive in the labour market, not looking for a job due to different barriers, such as a generalised lack of accessibility of workplaces, inaccessible transportation, built environment and infrastructure, insufficient or inadequate reasonable accommodation, lack of flexibility in employment, administrative burdens or incompatibility with disability benefits.\nThus, new and innovative ways of inclusion into the labour market of persons with disabilities need to be explored and tested with the objective to reduce the gaps between persons with and without disabilities, reduce inequalities and promote their social and economic inclusion on an equal basis with others. An assessment of the benefits, including for society and the economy, of employment of persons with disabilities could be carried out.\nResearch (including through SSH disciplines) should address the disadvantages and barriers faced for increasing inclusion in the labour market of persons with disabilities, collect data on proved effective measures to improve the situation, and provide a thorough analysis of the impact and efficacy of existing policy measures, such as positive discrimination provisions, quotas, employment targets and others. The role of employers, their concerns and good practices for labour inclusion of persons with disabilities needs to be assessed, as well as reasons to circumvent obligations to include employees with disabilities. Moreover, discrimination against persons with disabilities during the hiring process and the impact on job retention could be addressed.\nResearch should also take stock of existing accessible working environments tools and equipment, as well as reasonable accommodation tools and support at work already provided or still needed and their impact on the employment of persons with disabilities. The role of accessible digital services, digital skills and assistive technologies and other advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential for advancing the labour inclusion of persons with disabilities may be explored.\nDifferent types of work - adapted to the often-hidden talents of persons with disabilities - should be explored, taking into account their competences and abilities, disability type, level, sex and age. The transition from supported/sheltered employment to the open labour market, including different models such as self-employment and entrepreneurship, re- and upskilling, vocational education and training, could be considered, looking for sustainable pathways to facilitate the process and to be maintained in the long run.\nPersons with disabilities are at a higher risk of poverty due to insufficient labour market participation in combination with insufficient social protection and insufficient compensation for extra costs related to disability, including family-based care. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognises the right to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability (Art. 28).\nThus, research is expected to address the issue of social protection through the life course of persons with disabilities, including different aspects such as disability benefits, possible in-kind benefits, coverage of extra costs associated to disabilities, the transition to pension age for persons with disabilities or acquiring disabilities after pension age. Attention should be paid to measures that disincentivise or create barriers to the employment of persons with disabilities in the open labour market. Proposals should consider also the in and out of employment and the possible compatibility with other benefits, such as disability benefits avoiding the benefit trap. The benefit trap needs to be addressed since it may act as a deterrent to take employment for persons with disabilities, who may lose their disability benefits and may be led to in-work poverty.\nData collection is essential to understand the employment participation of persons with disabilities and remains a challenge to collect data disaggregated per type of disability, sex, and age. Thus, applicants are encouraged to ensure harmonised data collection by using Eurostat standards and existing international sets of questions in their areas of research. Applicants are encouraged to involve persons with disabilities and their representative organisations, stakeholders, policymakers and public authorities, social services, citizens and civil society organisations, end-users and service providers.\nProjects are also encouraged to explore potential complementarities with projects funded under the Cluster 2 topic HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-TRANSFO-9: “Good practices for increased autonomy of persons with disabilities, including physical, mental, intellectual and sensory disabilities” and Cluster 1 topic HORIZON-HLTH-2025-03-STAYHLTH-01-two-stage: “Improving the quality of life of persons with intellectual disabilities and their families”.\n[1] Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with disabilities: Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities\n[2] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e1e2228-7c97-11eb-9ac9-01aa75ed71a1/language-en",

      "scope": "Despite significant EU investment in migration research, many innovative solutions to gain insights and foresight remain underutilized in policymaking and practice. This topic aims to bridge that gap by systematically identifying, assessing, and facilitating the adoption of promising approaches developed in past EU-funded migration related projects to ensure a better fungibility between knowledge-oriented activities on past or future trends of migrations and policy making.\nProposals should map and analyse research outputs, methodologies, and innovations from relevant Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe migration projects, selecting those with high potential for policy uptake, operational implementation, market deployment and scaling. Proposals should consider ways to validate, adapt, and scale up these solutions across different governance levels (EU, national, local) and migration-related domains implementing high ethical standards and ensuring fundamental rights and privacy of all individuals affected. Applicants are encouraged to engage key stakeholders - including policymakers, migration practitioners, researchers (including from SSH disciplines), the private sector; groups or individuals that represent the interests of refugees and migrants and the civil society - to ensure that identified innovations align with real-world needs and implementation pathways and taking into account the political, legal, and cultural specificities of each Member State that influence implementation, while ensuring the solutions are transferable across contexts. Proposals are encouraged to take into consideration the assessment of the societal and political impacts as well as recommendations of previously funded Horizon research projects on migration. To that end, proposals are encouraged to carry out a mapping exercise.\nActivities may include pilots, policy labs, co-creation processes, or other mechanisms to enhance the transferability of research outcomes into policies and operational frameworks.\nA core element of the action will be fostering a structured dialogue between the research community and decision-makers to ensure continuous knowledge transfer and innovation mainstreaming. The initiative should contribute to a more dynamic, responsive and anticipatory EU migration ecosystem in the intersection of policy and research, in line with the objectives of the EU Pact on Asylum and Migration and other relevant policy frameworks.\nProposals may incorporate a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach in their research if relevant, by collecting data based for example on age, ability, ethnic and racial background, sex, socioeconomic status, and religion or belief to ensure that identified migration-related innovations align with real-world needs of people in migratory situation.\nProposals should delineate the plans for further applications of the knowledge, solutions and findings generated by their research at national and EU level. Knowledge and findings may be used with EU co-financing of instruments such as the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and/or subsequent funding instruments.\nProposals may envisage JRC participation, particularly to support the assessment of relevance, scalability and uptake of innovative solutions in migration management. The JRC could contribute with its knowledge of EU's migration systems, foresight, and capacity to bridge research and policymaking.",

      "scope": "Capabilities for situational awareness and surveillance of land and sea borders need improvement, in consideration of potential future challenges that may require updated capabilities. These challenges may include potential future large-scale movements of people across external borders, resulting from future attempts to instrumentalisation of irregular migration, but also from conflicts, social, economic, environmental and climate stress in the European neighbourhood; as well as increasing availability and capability of unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles with increased payload capacity and range that make it easier to transport goods and, possibly, persons, including in connection will illicit or illegal activities such as trafficking of goods and smuggling of people across external EU borders. These challenges will be particularly relevant in regions close to the European neighbourhood.\nThis may be particularly relevant for unsupervised and difficult-to-control land and sea borders of the Union and the Schengen area.\nResearch funded under this topic should develop solutions that, through better awareness, improve efficiency and reaction time of detection, search, rescue, and recovery operations near land and sea borders, in diverse geographical and meteorological conditions, taking into account the different and diverse needs. Research funded under this topic can also promote cross-border cooperation at European regional level around innovative border management solutions demonstration testbeds.\nActions funded under this topic should develop solutions that go beyond state-of-the-art in clearly demonstrable ways, including measurable improvements in detection range, accuracy, response time, automation, and system resilience.\nImproved border surveillance and situational awareness must better safeguard and promote fundamental rights and EU values, with a particular regard to human rights, using an inclusive approach that addresses diverse needs. Solutions should also provide reliable and redundant capacities, while ensuring the safety of staff, users, and persons who may be victim of illicit activities across external borders.\nThe EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities.\nCompatibility and integration with the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) is essential, and compatibility and/or exploitation of other European information-sharing environments, like the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), would be an additional asset.\nProposals should demonstrate that the proposed equipment and technologies contribute to cost reduction and energy efficiency of border surveillance and situational awareness operations.\nProposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard (ECBG) and of its Agency (Frontex). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase, including alignment with the EBCG Capability Roadmap and on the engagement with the Agency during the project implementation. At the proposal preparation stage, Frontex will not provide guidance on or otherwise be involved in the preparation of project proposals. However, proposals should consider and anticipate that Frontex may observe pilots and demonstrations during project implementation to facilitate the future uptake of innovations within the border and coast guard community.\nTo ensure active involvement and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should include a mid-term deliverable consisting of an assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, conducted by the practitioners involved in the project.",

      "scope": "Facilitation of travel and border crossings at border crossing points (BCPs) across the external EU borders went, and is further going, through developments thanks to updated procedures and regulatory frameworks and to innovative European technologies. From automated border control (ABC) gates to “no-gate” solutions and “seamless travel”, and with systems like the Entry-Exit System (EES), the Electronic Travel and Information Authorisation System (ETIAS), and the development of digital travel credentials and digital identity more in general, Europe has one of the most advanced, secure and facilitated border check systems in the world.\nTravel facilitation schemes are still not as fair, inclusive and accessible as they should be. There are several technical exceptions that for example make difficult for families, other groups of people travelling together, people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility, or with relatively lower digital skills, to smoothly use travel and border crossing facilitation solutions. This is a capability gap of travel facilitation systems that has an impact on both a fair accessibility and availability for travellers, and on performance and efficiency of the systems themselves. Travel facilitation systems should ensure both security and easy passenger flow, while remaining accessible to all travellers.\nOn the other hand, both technical systems and procedures may have differences depending on the context or the BCP of application. This may be a limit for the performance and user experience of European integrated border management, especially in a perspective of a larger help to national members of the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) from the Standing Corps of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCGA).\nAccording to the EBCG Capability Roadmap, legal border crossings should be as swift and simple as possible, while at the same time allowing a smooth crossing of bona fide persons, and of the goods carried with them.\nInnovation actions funded under this topic will develop and test solutions for advanced seamless travel and border crossing and/or visa procedures, protecting and promoting fundamental rights, minimising the risk for bias and being accessible for all travellers, with no or minimised limitations depending on age, sex, gender, disability, physical or digital abilities. To minimise potential for discrimination or physical or digital divide regarding travel facilitation schemes, solutions should be inclusive and accessible.\nFurthermore, solutions should be tested for use with the same approach by all European border control staff in all conditions and BCPs.\nThe proposed solutions can include innovative technologies, innovative processes, innovative knowledge and/or a combination thereof. Solutions should include automated decision support systems suggesting to the end-users (border checks operators) which procedure, technology or database can be used without infringing rights of travellers. Solutions should also integrate and, if appropriate, further develop, biometric matching that minimises data shared (for example limiting to matching scores) to improve data protection.\nProposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. At the stage of proposal preparation, Frontex and eu-LISA will not provide any guidance on, or otherwise be involved in the preparation of, project proposals. Proposals should consider and foresee that Frontex and eu-LISA may observe pilots and demonstrations when the project will be implemented, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border, customs and coast guard community.\nTo ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.\nDepending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Customs Authorities is welcome.",

      "scope": "Many unaccompanied children and young persons arriving at the external EU borders and seeking asylum, lack official documents showing their identity and age. Age assessment methods are important as they contribute to the determination of, for example, where an individual will be initially housed and what services, supports, and legal processes they will receive to ensure protection and, if applicable, child protection.\nIn other cases, minors are victim of trafficking of human beings (THB) criminal activities, either across the EU external borders, or within the EU borders. In other cases again, age assessment methods are necessary for law enforcement investigations on protecting children, forensic investigation, and/or the identification of victims.\nNo age assessment method can offer a 100% reliability. Different approaches have different sensitivity and specificity, and different sample sizes and representativeness, and some approaches are based on a non-European knowledge base. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in methods of age assessment. Methods may use approaches as diverse as interviews, psychological assessments and other holistic approaches; medical approaches such as X-rays, CT scans, DNA methylation, dental observation, or other analyses; other approaches such as image analysis; and they may use or not artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis.\nEU regulations, and guidelines by the European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA)[[ EASO Age assessment practices in EU+ countries: updated findings (europa.eu) https://euaa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EASO_Age_assessment_practices_updated.pdf []], include safeguards and recommendations, such as that the least invasive methods should be used, and that medical methods should be used as a last resort. Further studies, reports or documents have also been elaborated by the European Migration Network [1] , European networks of security practitioners for innovation, as well as at national level. The action funded by this topic should also consider these, as well as previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects.\nThis Coordination and Support Action should not develop methods or technologies of age assessment. Rather, it will analyse, including with practitioners, the current and potential methods for age assessment. It should assess and compare scientific reliability, sensitivity and specificity of different methods, as well as their potential risks for fundamental rights and how to minimize them.\nWhile the research results would not imply any legislative or policy decision on age assessment methods, the research will develop evidence-based results on options for more (compared to the state-of-the-art) appropriate models of age assessment methods that protect fundamental rights, ensuring the use of an inclusive approach that addresses diverse needs. The results of research funded by this topic will contribute to capabilities for better identification of children and minors in the migratory, security, border management and other contexts, following the principles of the EU Strategy on the rights of the child [2] . They will also contribute to the exchange of practices among European authorities.\nSynergies with other Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Destinations, such as “Better protect the EU and its citizens against Crime and Terrorism” and “Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe”, as well as with Destinations of Horizon Europe Cluster 2 “Inclusive Society”.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/networks/european-migration-network-emn_en\n[2] COM(2021) 142 final.",

      "scope": "Building on the whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach, this topic should contribute to enhancing risk awareness and disaster preparedness through the development of innovative tools, methodologies, and frameworks. A key focus should be on integrating diverse societal and resilience perspectives considering people in a vulnerable situation, ensuring inclusive participation in risk communication strategies, and leveraging accessible advanced technologies and processes to improve public understanding of hazards and vulnerabilities (such as gender, disabilities and others social factors. and capabilities. Efforts should aim at designing and validating novel approaches to risk perception, communication, including digital platforms, immersive technologies, and participatory tools that foster citizen engagement and behavioural change, as well as wildlife protection. Behavioural insights should inform the projects on effective methods in population’s preparedness including the risk communication. Special attention should be given to marginalized or vulnerable groups in a vulnerable situation ensure equitable access to risk information and preparedness resources.\nTo strengthen disaster preparedness and response capabilities across Europe, there is a clear need for an innovative, interoperable solution that enables the development of new strategies for risk awareness and disaster management. Such a solution should facilitate seamless collaboration between public authorities, civil society, local communities, and the private sector. It must support the co-creation of comprehensive preparedness plans that ensure a coordinated, robust, resilient, and effective response to a wide range of disaster scenarios. Central to this approach should be the integration of a command-and-control system that allows for centralized information management, efficient coordination among all stakeholders, and rapid, data-driven decision-making in emergency situations. For example, efforts to guarantee early action from early warning should be taken into account.\nFurthermore, proposals should work towards the creation of comprehensive, multi-stakeholder preparedness plans that involve all levels of governance, civil society, the private sector, and local communities. These plans should establish mechanisms for cross-sectoral coordination, efficient resource allocation, and effective decision-making in crisis situations and the development of solutions and tools to ensure a greater culture of safety and societal resilience in the communities. Research should also explore innovative governance models that enhance interoperability and cooperation between different entities. To strengthen disaster resilience, proposals should develop and test adaptive response frameworks that enhance collaboration between public authorities, civil society, communities, and businesses. These frameworks should incorporate near real-time risk assessment tools, digital simulations, and scenario-based exercises to improve the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disasters. The integration of AI-driven decision-support systems, taking into account existing biases, digital twin technologies (including Destination Earth), and predictive analytics could further contribute to a more effective, evidence-based crisis response.\nProjects are expected to contribute to the overall enhancement of societal resilience by fostering a culture of preparedness, strengthening community-driven disaster risk reduction initiatives, proactive engagement in prevention- and mitigation of disaster’s effects, and ensuring that all actors within society have the necessary tools and knowledge to respond effectively to future crises.\nWhere relevant, projects may take into account the assets, but also particular challenges faced by the European outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s composition.\nProjects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities.\nInternational cooperation in this topic is strongly recommended. Proposals should also take into account lessons learned from past disasters and align with existing EU policies, frameworks, and international commitments in the field of disaster risk reduction and crisis management. Especially the population preparedness chapter of the Preparedness Union Strategy, such as the preparEU initiative, should be considered. Finding synergies with projects from operational grants, such as the Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP) [1] , is recommended.\n[1] Knowledge for Action in Prevention and Preparedness (KAPP) - European Commission - https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/funding-evaluations/financing-civil-protection/cp-calls-proposals/knowledge-action-prevention-and-preparedness-kapp-0_en",

      "scope": "This topic aims to foster the widespread adoption and integration of high-TRL (Technology Readiness Level) disaster risk solutions (DRS) across multiple sectors, enhancing societal resilience to various hazards, including climate. The focus is on overcoming barriers to deployment, ensuring accessibility, and strengthening collaboration among stakeholders to drive innovation uptake. Projects should promote the adoption of high-TRL solutions by public and private sector organizations involved in disaster risk management, developing strategies for scaling and commercializing innovative DRS technologies to ensure they reach end-users efficiently. They should also demonstrate how these technologies can complement or replace existing disaster preparedness, response, and recovery frameworks by developing integrated governance and coordination models across sectors and levels for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in multi-hazard and cascading risk scenario interoperability standards, and guidelines for integrating new solutions into national and European civil protection systems. The project should especially liaise and support other disaster resilience projects in driving their uptake as well as examine how to build synergy pathways with other preparedness grants, such as Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP) funding call of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).\nAddressing deployment barriers is crucial, including identifying and mitigating technical, regulatory, financial, and social obstacles hindering the uptake of advanced solutions, while ensuring accessibility and usability for diverse stakeholders such as first responders, local authorities, and communities and individuals in a vulnerable situation. Projects should also demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of high-TRL solutions through large-scale pilot projects and demonstrations, generating robust evidence to support data-driven decision-making and optimize disaster risk reduction strategies. Initiatives should consider the capacity gaps of the UCPM [1] , align with EU disaster resilience objectives and build on existing programs, ensuring synergies with relevant policies, funding mechanisms, and technological ecosystems. The private-public cooperation chapter of the Preparedness Union Strategy should especially be a guiding document. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate digital tools, AI-driven analytics, digital twins such as Destination Earth, IoT applications, and other emerging technologies to enhance disaster preparedness and response.\nProposals should have a strategy to promote the visibility of the project and the results to the broader public in order to show the potential of European civil security research (political sphere, private sector, citizens). This could entail the European Civil Protection Forum and the European Commission Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre platform as examples.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\n[1] eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0286",

      "scope": "Climate change is a global challenge with profound security implications at the global, regional, and local levels. It exacerbates risks across multiple sectors, including agriculture, biodiversity, health, border security, economy, financial stability, transport, telecommunication and human displacement, leading to severe socio-economic consequences and destabilizing communities. The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters highlight the urgent need for a holistic, long-term strategy to address climate security, integrating risk assessment, crisis management, and adaptation measures, while also leveraging the expertise of the insurance sector.\nWhile climate services based on data analysis have reached a high level of trust among users, their application to civil security remains underdeveloped. Proposals should aim to develop methodologies, tools, and technologies that enhance situational awareness both before a crisis (pre-crisis) and after a crisis (post-crisis), enabling decision-makers and populations to respond effectively. Research should focus on defining priority climate security scenarios in the EU, identifying key stakeholders, and establishing essential indicators for informed decision-making.\nEfforts should be directed toward understanding and mitigating the impacts of floods, landslides, wildfires, and other climate-induced disasters. This includes developing improved methods and models for risk prevention and reduction, early detection, emergency response tactics, and rescue efforts under extreme conditions. The study of cascading effects and compounding disasters is critical, particularly regarding groups in a vulnerable situation such as older people, people with disabilities, and children. In this view, the proposals should build on the European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA [1] ) and consolidated national risk assessments [2] as well as find synergies with project’s chosen for the similar EU Mission: Adaptation to Climate Change topic [3] . Both the European Preparedness Union Strategy, the European Water Resilience Strategy and the upcoming European Climate Adaptation Plan act as policy guidance.\nDiverse climate and environmental security scenarios should be developed, supported by innovative, reliable tools that leverage multiple data sources, enabling a comprehensive and adaptive response. Proposals should also integrate space programme components such as Copernicus and Galileo to improve data accuracy and crisis response capabilities. A strong emphasis on international cooperation should foster knowledge exchange, enhance policy integration, and share best practices. Proposals should support transnational collaboration within the EU, facilitate improved data-sharing mechanisms, and align with global initiatives such as the Sendai Disaster Risk Reduction Framework. Capacity-building efforts to strengthen resilience to climate-related security threats and ensure a coordinated approach to addressing worst-case climate scenarios, as identified in the Niinistö report [4] .\nProjects may take into account the assets but also particular challenges faced by the European outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s composition.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, Copernicus, Destination Earth, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "Global climate change is a megatrend expected to affect our societies over the next decade. As stated in “Germany: National interdisciplinary climate risk assessment” [1] , “We are already living in the climate crisis. This brings substantial security risks at global and national levels. (...) Anyone thinking about security needs to think about climate as well”.\nClimate change will affect European law enforcement in various ways [2] , [3] . Notably, it is likely to create new opportunities and resources for organised crime, challenging current security frameworks. One of the expected outcomes of climate change will be the emergence of scarcity markets. Links between resource scarcity propelled by climate change and the crime opportunities for organised crime groups need to be further analysed. Criminal networks will aim to dominate the scarcity markets, increasing their role in the distribution of essential goods and services such as food and water. In addition, criminal networks will facilitate the movement of migrants, including women and children, escaping conflict and the effects of climate change; increased flux of migration due to extreme weather conditions may raise opportunities for human trafficking and exploitation. Furthermore, the decline in biodiversity will translate into more animal species under threat of extinction targeted by wildlife traffickers. In this landscape, the adoption of new technologies will bolster criminal organizations of various kinds. Examples of such crimes, illegal activities, threats and harms connected to climate change include: environmental crimes contributing to climate change (illegal mining and extraction, illegal use of underwater sources and streams, illegal deforestation, illegal waste management), wildlife trafficking and poaching, fraud and financial crimes (greenwashing, carbon credit fraud, misuse of climate funds), exploiting climate change-related disasters (water theft, looting after disasters, land grabbing), or social tensions (new forms of radicalisation and terrorism, increased displacement and migration challenging public order and disproportionately affecting groups in a vulnerable situation).\nNew approaches centred around crime and climate change, including crime activities’ association with and amplification by climate change, present unique challenges that require thorough investigation and analysis. Recognizing these emerging trends is vital for formulating effective plans and policies, and equipping law enforcement with specialized skills, technology (including forensics) and training necessary to tackle these challenges in an increasingly volatile world.\nIn this topic, apart from the mandatory participation of Police Authorities in the consortia, active involvement of other security practitioners, such as civil security services, Border Guard or Customs Authorities, is encouraged if relevant. Technological and societal angles should be addressed in a balanced way.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. For Police Authorities’ training-related aspects, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Research in this area could be strengthened by considering the gender-specific dimensions of vulnerabilities and needs when relevant.\n[1] https://metis.unibw.de/assets/pdf/National_Interdisciplinary_Climate_Risk_Assessment.pdf\n[2] A.Matczak, S.I.

      "scope": "New and emerging technologies (e.g., new communication technologies, quantum technologies, new biometrics and identification technologies, cloud computing technologies, generative AI etc.) bring many benefits but also pose a number of new challenges for the police and the judiciary. Therefore, there is a strong need to adequately tackle challenges for Police Authorities stemming from all these new and emerging developments as well as to make sure that the lawful access to data keeps track with these evolutions, respecting applicable legislation and fundamental rights such as personal data protection and privacy.\nUnder the Open topic, proposals are welcome to address new and emerging technologies that are not covered by the other projects of the previous Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime and Terrorism, as well as of the current Call Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2026-2027. Proposals should emphasize adaptive methodologies and frameworks that can evolve in response to new threats and challenges, empowering Police Authorities to act effectively while ensuring adherence to legal standards regarding data access. Thus, research activities proposed within this topic should, in a balanced way, 1) develop modern tools, methodologies and training material for police to tackle the problem of misuse for criminal purposes of the new and emerging technologies under consideration, and 2) address issues related to lawful access to data in this context.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender and intersectional dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.\nThe proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of Europol [1] are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For Police Authorities’ training-related aspects, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0794 (Annex I).",

Those improved skills, tools and training curricula are to take into account European multicultural dimension, as well as legal and ethical rules of operation;\n- Enhanced investigation tools and methodologies for Police Authorities in Europe to tackle cold cases in the context of missing persons, based on modern (forensic) technologies and criminology;\n- Modern training curricula for Police Authorities, their improved cross-border cooperation and enhanced tools and methodologies to tackle new cases of missing persons;\n- Enriched European common approaches applied by Police Authorities in Europe to fight the issue of missing persons relying on the synergy of technology, the latest socio-psychological knowledge learned from cases, as well as field experience of Police Authorities and entities dealing with victims, while fully respecting fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and anonymity of victims.",
      "scope": "The issue of missing persons is a multifaceted challenge that encompasses diverse categories and is influenced by various factors. People may go missing under a variety of circumstances, such as voluntary disappearances, abductions, cases related to mental health crises, or because of conflict, migration, geopolitical instability, natural disasters. Groups in a vulnerable situation - notably children, victims of trafficking and exploitation, persons with disabilities and persons suffering from cognitive impairments - face an even greater risk of going missing, often under distressing and dangerous conditions. Tackling this issue requires a coordinated response from multiple stakeholders, from Police Authorities via Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) or Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to the involvement of the overall society.\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement and societal developments, there is a pressing need to improve current European approaches to fight the issue of missing persons (prevention and/or investigation of cold and new cases) using innovative societal and technological solutions. To this end, modernised skills, training curricula and methodologies for Police Authorities, CSOs and NGOs to work with people in a vulnerable situation and children are needed, such as effective awareness raising campaigns, which should be accessible to persons with disabilities, that take into account European multicultural dimension. When it comes to investigation, Police Authorities need efficient tools that benefit from new and emerging technologies to solve cold cases while combining modern forensic science (including biometrics and digital forensics) and criminology, e.g., modern tools for using an old DNA, or accurate facial ageing, among others. When multiple practitioners are involved in exchanging sensitive data, data sharing tools in a privacy-preserving manner should be considered. Furthermore, for new cases of missing persons, apart from an improved cross-border cooperation, Police Authorities also need, on the one hand, a modernised training to face such situations more efficiently, improving the dialogues and interactions with families, taking into account a gender sensitive and intersectional approach when relevant, and on the other hand, modern technologies and forensic tools for, for example, fast and reliable cross-matching of DNA samples between new and cold cases.\nIf a proposal concerns forensics, its consortium should involve forensic institutes as well. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.",

Novel approaches of collaboration between different community stakeholders, from Police Authorities, civil society, national and local entities, private actors, trained psychologists, are expected to be developed as well, with the aim of increasing communities’ addiction resilience, security and safety. An emphasis of the work should be on young people at risk, the criminal justice system, drivers of criminality and pathways from committing a petty crime because of addiction to progressively getting involved in organised crime.

Also, incorporating a gender-sensitive approach will allow to better understand the relationships between addiction, crime, and gender, leading to more effective interventions that address the specific needs of men, women, and marginalized groups.\nProposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.\nFurthermore, proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations.

This topic aims at providing such places with solutions for ensuring civil security (of pupils, school staff, administrative workers, citizens at large) via exploring various societal and technological means of preventing such threats, with full respect of fundamental rights, such as rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. Based on a thorough analysis of the phenomenon under consideration in the European context, proposals should look into methodologies of catching and tackling early signs of terrorist threats, isolation and radicalisation, taking into account the social and cultural factors that may influence an individual's vulnerability to radicalisation, such as gender roles and stereotypes. Proposals should also consider how these factors may impact the effectiveness of prevention programmes and of addressing them by, e.g., creating appropriate programmes, including by modernising approaches for prevention of terrorist and lone actor attacks. Means for raising awareness (possibly training) of the relevant staff (school staff, employees in public administration, etc., in function of the building under consideration) regarding existing risks and for keeping them up to date on security matters should be tackled and designed to be inclusive and effective for diverse groups. Ways of improving cooperation between the relevant staff and Police Authorities in this context should be analysed too. Proposed solutions should be affordable to public schools and other structures accessible to the public that are usually more limited in funding. Proposals are invited from consortia involving Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners, Civil Society Organisations, Non-Governmental Organisations, and the appropriate balance of IT specialists, psychologists, sociologists, etc. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.

      "scope": "The rising threat of bioterrorism is driven by recent scientific advancements, notably by growing accessibility of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, related commercial services and public databases, which in turn enhance their obtainability to non-state actors and individuals with malicious intentions. The proliferation of do-it-yourself biohacking and community laboratories, including gene editing and sequencing technology, dropping costs of equipment and increased simplicity of use may inadvertently facilitate knowledge and skills dissemination about biological threats and open new pathways for bioterrorism. Challenges in detection, particularly the lengthy incubation periods of biological agents, underscore the urgent need for improved identification technologies to allow for timely intervention and reduce potential mass casualties, considering both characterization through advanced tools by expert labs and simple deployable methods. Given that properly weaponized biological agents can be more lethal than nuclear weapons, their cross-border implications warrant focused attention. Recent incidents involving biotoxins across various European countries illustrate the feasibility of biological attacks. The increasing weaponisation of drones highlights an alarming trend that could extend to biological agents, further complicating threat landscapes. The potential economic and social consequences of biological attacks necessitate robust prevention and preparedness measures to mitigate overwhelming impacts on healthcare systems and society at large.\nProposals are expected to address, in a lawful manner, the emerging threats of bioterrorism in Europe, particularly in the context of synthetic biology. Recognising bioterrorism as a low-probability but high-impact event, consortia should review current and future risks, flag areas requiring reinforced monitoring, as well as identify missing regulatory frameworks necessary for ensuring public security and safety. Furthermore, proposals should bring together diverse consortia to enhance our understanding, prevention, preparedness, and response to bioterrorism and create a comprehensive approach to this pressing issue.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\nProposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.",

      "scope": "The resilience of critical entities is of paramount importance as disruptions to these systems can have significant consequences for the whole economy, public health, security or safety. These systems, responsible for providing essential services for modern society, are increasingly complex and interconnected, making them vulnerable to a range of threats, including cyber-attacks, physical attacks, malfunctions, human-induced or natural disasters.\nThe objective of this topic is to facilitate the stress testing of critical infrastructure by providing specialized tools and methodologies and support validation. This will enable the identification and testing of technical and operational vulnerabilities, inform of effective solutions to mitigate these risks, and facilitate the collection and analysis of data to enhance resilience plans that shall be established by each critical entity. Building on the insights gained from previous exercises, the ultimate goal is to establish more robust and comprehensive stress testing protocols, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of critical infrastructure.\nThe proposed solutions may, among others, support simulation and modelling, multi-hazard and multi-threat scenario building, data analytics, including geospatial information, Digital Twins, assessment of risks and adaptive capabilities, as well as impact of human factors.\nThese solutions should be designed to be inclusive and accessible, considering the needs of diverse users and stakeholders. Solutions should allow flexible configuration taking into account the evolving nature of threats and hazards. If feasible they should also be adaptable to different sectors and should support stress testing under diverse environmental and geographical conditions, including operation in harsh and remote environments. Moreover, they should comply with the relevant legislative frameworks and allow application of the developed tools under the current regime taking into account the sensitivity and confidentiality of the processed information.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic and projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-01: Open topic for improved preparedness for, response to and recovery from large-scale disruptions of critical infrastructures and HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European critical entities , should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, share resources and exploit complementarities and opportunities for increased impact.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\nWhere relevant, funded projects are encouraged to liaise with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, for complementary real-scale testing at the Reaction Wall and HopLab of the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA).",

      "scope": "Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to the world, and the green transition is a critical component of the EU's strategy to reduce and mitigate their impacts, as well as to contribute to the European competitiveness. This approach is also part of the effort to transform Europe into a modern, resource-efficient, resilient and competitive economy. However, rapid deployment of new and emerging technologies, such as, but not limited to: green and grid-interactive roofs and walls, solar power installations, electric vehicle charging stations, energy storages, smart sensors and surveillance systems, green transportation systems, nature-based or other sustainable or reused construction materials, or specific infrastructure solutions may create security risks through new interdependencies including legacy infrastructure, the accumulation of deployed solutions, or otherwise create new potential risks and hazards of unknown scale and origin.\nProposals submitted under this topic should investigate the integration of sustainable & environmentally friendly technologies into urban and peri-urban areas to identify and explore physical and cyber risks and vulnerabilities resulting from this phenomenon, including, but not limited to: battery fires, toxic leaks, electric shocks, structural integrity, toxic waste, data privacy, land management disruptions, including potential negative impacts on the natural environment, or social and community tensions. The proposals should also consider the threat of malicious access, software and data manipulation and misuse of managing systems potentially leading to harm to health, loss of life, environmental damage or economic damage, regardless of whether the intention is criminal, vandalism, hybrid attack or other.\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to inform operators, first responders and authorities on how to mitigate risks, enhance their preparedness and improve their response to potential incidents. By recognizing emerging threats, it should be possible to prevent major incidents from occurring, and in the event of an accident, provide effective strategies, managerial advice, processes and methodologies to respond and recover. The research should provide recommendations that are tailored to diverse communities and context needs such as those with different socio-economic profiles, adapted to people of different ages and genders to identify and mitigate physical and cyber risks and vulnerabilities. Proactively addressing major safety and security risks associated with the green transition will help to future-proof these technologies, build public trust, and promote their widespread acceptance, backed by evidence-based safety and security policies.\nThe proposed research should provide a comprehensive understanding of adaptive capabilities, the risks and vulnerabilities associated with green technologies , as well as practical recommendations for mitigating these risks and ensuring their safe, resilient and secure deployment while utilising the nature-based solutions and respecting principles of biodiversity. By doing so, it will contribute to the development of a resilient and sustainable urban environment, where the benefits of green technologies can be fully realized while minimizing their potential risks and negative impacts.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

The vulnerability of key infrastructures is exacerbated by their growing interdependencies and the systemic propagation of risks across sectors and borders. In this context, ensuring the monitoring, protection and continuity of essential services has become fundamental to preserving and enhancing societal resilience.\nThis topic aims to support the development and demonstration of targeted high-tech capabilities that address specific preparedness, operational, and recovery gaps in the resilience of critical entities [1] under multi-hazard and NaTech conditions. It calls for moving beyond generic resilience frameworks toward sector-specific, interoperable, and modular technological and governance solutions that can be deployed and tested in realistic operational settings.\nProposals should be grounded in existing risk assessments and draw on lessons learned from recent disruptive events. They are expected to deliver measurable improvements in both technological and organisational resilience through the identification and prioritisation of critical capability gaps, especially where cascading and cross-sectoral risks are likely to arise. In parallel, adaptive continuity planning and decision-making tools should be designed to enhance situational awareness, support dynamic response coordination, and maintain service continuity in fast-evolving crisis scenarios.\nProposals should also demonstrate cross-border, multi-actor coordination mechanisms through simulations or testing in real operational environments, involving public authorities, emergency responders, and critical service operators or representative environments where critical infrastructure is particularly exposed to multi-hazard risks.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, particularly in regions with cross-border infrastructure or shared vulnerabilities. Actions should take due account of the relevant EU legal and policy frameworks and are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introductions of the Resilient Infrastructure and Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe Destinations.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic and projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-01: Open topic for improved preparedness for, response to and recovery from large-scale disruptions of critical infrastructures and HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European critical entities , and HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-04: Hi-tech capacities for crisis response and recovery after a natural-technological (NaTech) disaster should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, share resources and exploit complementarities and opportunities for increased impact.\n[1] Including, but not limited to, infrastructures addressed by the revised EU Maritime Security Strategy (JOIN/2023/8) and the European Port Strategy.",

A key focus is bridging the gap between early-stage, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) research and applied security solutions, ensuring that emerging technologies are effectively transitioned into operational use.\nProposals should prioritize disruptive solutions that address diverse security threats while improving the efficiency and effectiveness of civil security operations. Emphasis should be placed on ensuring that these technologies are robust, reliable, scalable, and aligned with the needs of security practitioners. This includes fostering a structured pathway for transitioning low TRL innovations into practical applications, ensuring rigorous testing and validation processes for safety, performance, and interoperability.\nTo achieve this, proposals should promote strong collaboration between researchers, public authorities, industry partners, and end-users. Such partnerships will help align technological advancements with real-world security needs, facilitating the co-development of solutions that are both innovative and operationally relevant. Ensuring that emerging technologies are ethically sound, transparent, and accessible will also be crucial to their successful adoption.\nThe expected outcomes of this topic include improved preparedness through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies tailored to emerging security challenges, enhanced risk mitigation capabilities, and the accelerated integration of disruptive innovations into civil security frameworks.

The tender process to be followed is described in Annex H.\nProposals should demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects should be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is recommendable to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:\n- Procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.\n- Launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.\n- Adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).\n- Foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).\nIn these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP [1] . In the first case, the procurers should foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers should foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users that are not part of the consortium (e.g. citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly hardware components, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.\nApplicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:\n- A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.\n- Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2026-2027, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call expects proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.\n- Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;\n- Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.\n- Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.\nApplicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] See General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.",

      "scope": "This Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI) initiative aims to advance the adoption of innovative civil security solutions. The focus is on solutions that have been partially demonstrated on a small scale and are nearly or already available in small quantities but have not yet been widely adopted or produced at scale. These solutions should demonstrate a clear market potential and be new to the procurers, their market segment, or the internal EU market, and must be relevant to procurers across EU Member States and/or Associated Countries.\nThis PPI will specifically target innovative solutions that can address critical challenges in civil security and that are aligned with market readiness criteria. The solutions should meet requirements for sustainability (both operational and environmental), interoperability, adaptability, and be commercially viable while still holding residual market risks, such as not yet being produced in large quantities or at market-ready quality and pricing.\nThis initiative will focus on solutions that have already demonstrated partially successful results but require scaling, refinement, or deployment in new environments to meet mass-market price/quality standards. This is in line with Horizon Europe’s objective of fostering the early adoption of innovations that are critical to improving civil security across Europe [1] .\nIn compliance with the requirements of the Horizon Europe Work Programme – General Annex H, this action will engage in open market consultations with potential tenderers and end-users to identify gaps between perceived procurement needs and current industry developments. Feedback from these consultations will inform the PPI tender specifications, ensuring that the PPI emphasizes the early adoption of innovative solutions rather than the procurement of fully mature or mass-market technologies. The market readiness of the solutions can be verified through conformity testing, certification, or quality labelling. The work will also involve establishing evaluation criteria based on best-value-for-money rather than solely on the lowest price, ensuring that innovations are assessed for both their technical performance and their potential to deliver long-term value.\nThe PPI contract notices will be published EU-wide, with offers evaluated on objective criteria, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection process. Functional/performance-based specifications will be used to define the challenges and problems to be solved, rather than prescriptive solutions, and procurement will avoid any conflicts of interest. The distribution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) will be clearly outlined in the PPI call for tenders, in line with the objective of promoting fair and wide exploitation of the results.\nThe process to be followed for the preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender is described in General Annex H.\nBy fostering the early adoption of innovative technologies, this PPI initiative will enable the European civil security sector to address emerging threats, while contributing to the EU’s broader goals of technological sovereignty and market innovation. This will allow public authorities to remain at the forefront of addressing evolving risks and threats. The action will also catalyse innovation, drive competition, and significantly reduce the time needed to move from the initial concept to market.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] For more information see General Annex H of Horizon Europe Work Programme – Specific Conditions for Actions with PCP/PPI.",

It aims to advance next-generation capabilities, ensuring robust, scalable, and interoperable communication systems tailored to the critical civil security functions that will be required for the future EUCCS, taking into consideration the ongoing migration of the EU towards post-quantum cryptography.\nThe action funded under this topic will develop secure communication devices and applications that meet the unique needs of practitioners across various disciplines. These solutions will go beyond current technologies, enabling specialized, ruggedized devices that support hands-free capabilities, including wearable sensors, haptics, and augmented reality to enhance situational awareness. Devices will be designed to ensure communication in environments lacking cellular infrastructure and will be built with high standards of security, including addressing cryptographic security via post-quantum cryptography, and trustworthiness while also ensuring an inclusive and gender-sensitive approach to meet the diverse needs of all users. The action funded under this topic should support relevant standardisation processes where possible.\nThe solutions should be mission-critical, offering high availability, resilience, data exchange and authentication both secured via state-of-the-art post-quantum cryptographic protocols, even in areas with limited or no commercial network coverage. They must be fully compatible with the EUCCS, leveraging 3GPP Mission Critical Services (MCX) and open APIs to create a versatile and interoperable ecosystem. By working closely with first responders and utilizing open platforms, the project will ensure that the developed solutions address the specific operational needs of responders, facilitating effective cross-agency and pan-European collaboration.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.",

      "scope": "The increasing reliance on AI in cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, and decision-making processes raises concerns about the security and robustness of AI systems. As AI systems become more prevalent, they are increasingly targeted by adversarial attacks that manipulate inputs, compromise training data, or introduce hidden vulnerabilities. This topic aims to strengthen the resilience of AI systems and algorithms against various threats and attacks, such as enhancing their resilience against adversarial attacks, backdoor injections, and data poisoning. Proposals should develop real-time anomaly detection, mitigation techniques to defend against adversarial attacks and robust federated learning techniques, in synergies with leading efforts on AI transparency, and in compliance with the AI Act. The topic is expected to:\n- Develop robust AI models resistant to adversarial attacks. Exploring techniques to harden AI models and systems against adversarial perturbations, such as adversarial training, robust optimisation, and defence mechanisms that enhance the trustworthiness of AI.\n- Improve detection of manipulated or poisoned training data. Advancing methodologies to identify and mitigate compromised datasets, leveraging techniques such as anomaly detection, provenance tracking, and automated data validation mechanisms.\n- Address the concept of Private AI by developing mechanisms that enable AI models to be trained, deployed and operated in privacy-preserving environments, particularly for sensitive use cases, as for example for government and enterprise settings. This includes ensuring AI computations and data remain within trusted execution boundaries (e.g. on-premise or regulated cloud environments), and leveraging existing and emerging privacy-enhancing techniques such as federated learning, secure aggregation, computing on encrypted data, quantum-safe homomorphic encryption and secure inference in deep learning to safeguard the protection of personal and other sensitive data throughout the AI lifecycle.",

This topic aims at supporting research and innovation that explore, develop and test enhanced capabilities for securely issuing, verify and manage (including sharing) possible future types of digital travel credentials (DTCs) for travel across the external borders of the EU.\nThe proposed solutions must be compatible with current, planned or foreseeable EU DTCs formats, and with applicable International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) schemes, but they should also push forward to possible further types of DTCs (“Type 2” and “Type 3”).\nAdditionally, the funded actions should also work on the integration of current and new biometrics, and/or new biometric acquisition modality, in support of DTCs. This includes but does not limit to biometrics such as fingermark, palmprint, palmmark, rolled fingerprint, contactless fingerphotos, and biometric acquisition modalities such as remote and on-the-move, including those modalities developed by previous projects funded by this Destination of Horizon Europe Cluster 3. The project should develop and/or contribute to reference biometric sample quality assessments standards for these biometric modalities included in the DTCs, compatibly with existing relevant tools such as the Open Source Face Image Quality (OFIQ), or improving forward-looking interoperability, for example between contact and contactless fingerprint data.\nThe funded research project(s) can also address the use case of verification, issuance or re-issuance of (emergency) DTCs in cases of emergencies (including evacuations of EU citizens).\nFunded research can additionally address the security of breeder documents, which risk to be “weak links” when they are used to obtain genuine, secure travel credentials.\nProposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. At the stage of proposal preparation, Frontex and eu-LISA will not provide any guidance on, or otherwise be involved in the preparation of, project proposals. Proposals should consider and foresee that Frontex and eu-LISA may observe pilots and demonstrations when the project will be implemented, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.\nTo ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.",

      "scope": "Today’s global economy and high-volume trade flows require much and fast transport to deliver products worldwide. Traders and consumers expect quick and easy transactions, while customs administrations face the challenge of controlling the goods without disrupting their flow. This is exploited by organised crime and terrorist organisations, which take advantage of the large amount of goods to conceal threats or illegal and/or dangerous materials in legal commercial cargo, with the aim of causing damage, disruption, or of it illegally crossing borders unnoticed.\nCustoms authorities must ensure a high level of compliance with both security and revenue objectives: trafficked materials may represent a threat, and undetected smuggled licit materials entering the EU deprive the Member States of the revenue due if the material had been legally traded. In addition, illegal trafficking can have an impact in the environment (such as biodiversity loss or deforestation) or for the EU citizens’ safety and health.\nThe air and maritime cargo contexts present security challenges as well as high potential consequences of threats, primarily but not limited to explosives and incendiary devices. Air cargo can represent continuity assurances to cope, at least in the short term and for critical lines, with supply chain and/or distribution crises; while maritime cargo remains the most common transport mode in global trade. The risk for well-concealed materials not being detected during screening, or the risk of concealment during the supply chain is pressing.\nLogistical hubs also need to strengthen their capabilities to adapt to sudden changes, and customs authorities need to mobilise their available resources to ensure efficient and fast controls. The need for better mobility and improved agility for customs is accompanied by the need to deploy scalable solutions, that are interoperable with other systems to facilitate co-sharing of equipment between BCPs and between Member States.\nInnovation actions funded under this topic should develop and test solutions for cargo security, relevant to one or more transport modes (maritime, air, postal, road, or rail); and usable at one (or more) crucial point(s) of the supply chain. Innovation can also develop enhanced capabilities for customs to detect illicit, regulated and / or dangerous goods and transactions, and to be able to effectively characterise them in a timely manner. Improved tracking and tracing capabilities will facilitate the seizing of the materials while contributing to collecting data and evidence to further support investigations and prosecutions.\nProposals are expected to address one of the following options that should be explicitly selected:\nOption a: security of cargo\nOption b: detection of smuggled and trafficked goods/materials in cargo\nDetection capabilities should target one or more type(s) of dangerous, illicit and/or illegal goods or materials, including: explosive or incendiary devices; illicit drugs and their precursors; illegally traded species, including covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and considering the Regulation on Deforestation-free Products [1] ; illegally traded cultural property; contraband; trafficked weapons; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRN-E) material or precursors; F-gases; and/or various modi operandi related to cross-border trafficking, including involving cargo.\nWhere the identification of illegal goods cannot be achieved without opening containers (for example, in the case of species or their parts), and where imagery, chemical, or molecular tests are required, appropriate measures should be established to reduce the response time between sampling and expert assessment, thereby minimizing disruption to the flow of goods.\nExamples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research actions include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): smart active defuse systems, sensors, artificial intelligence, tracking and tracing systems, distributed ledger technologies, non-intrusive inspection, automated threat recognition systems, and screening and scanning systems.\nEquipment and technologies enabling increased security of cargo should contribute to cost and energy efficiency, limit their environmental impact and being more sustainable when they will be taken up in the future. An increased security of air cargo, furthermore, should not be regarded as an incentive to use air transport when this has a higher environmental and emissions impact, but prioritised on critical supply lines and/or situations.\nProposals received under this topic should demonstrate how the project would integrate the perspective for the whole supply chain, from load to delivery. Proposed solutions should be interoperable with the different relevant equipment and systems deployed by the customs authorities. Proposals should demonstrate how their solutions would align with existing interoperability standards (if any), and consider issues of cybersecurity and EU technological sovereignty and strategic autonomy. Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to align with the customs reform (if adopted) and customs policy priorities, and the projects should, once started, align with the policy priorities of the proposed EU Customs Authority and its Data Hub (if established).\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.\nResearch projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.\nProposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals. The results of the research should be taken up by EU customs authorities with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI) and/or subsequent funding opportunities, or the proposed EU Customs Authority and its Data Hub (once established).\nSynergies within civil security can be an asset, for example with Better protect the EU and its citizens against Crime and Terrorism and Resilient Infrastructure.\n[1] https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en",

      "scope": "As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too do the myriads of online harms that threaten citizens’ security and well-being. To address these challenges, we invite proposals for the development of detection and investigation tools that employ short development cycle models. This approach emphasizes agility and responsiveness, ensuring that tools can quickly adapt to emerging online threats, such as identity theft, disinformation, deepfakes, spoofing, phishing, digital violence, or, e.g., tools for an early detection as well as real-time monitoring and risk assessment that can identify potential fraudulent sales (“online payment fraud”) before they occur.\nThis topic welcomes innovative ideas focused on creating efficient detection and investigation tools to combat varying forms of online harms, which should be selected at the beginning of every new development cycle, in agreement with all stakeholders involved in the consortia, especially including concrete needs of Police Authorities. The emphasis on short development cycles allows proposals to remain dynamic, responsive to the fast-paced nature of online threats, and capable of addressing both established issues and new challenges as they arise. Proposals should focus on the iterative process of tool development, integrating feedback from Police Authorities to ensure continuous improvement and relevance in combating online harms. Ultimately, the goal is to foster a proactive and effective response to safeguarding online spaces for all users, regardless of their gender identity or expression.\nProposals are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project. Furthermore, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination. The project should have a minimum estimated duration of 48 months.",

      "scope": "This topic addresses challenges of community policing in increasingly diverse and sometimes also fragile societies, including the integration of returnees from conflict zones, migrants, as well as marginalized communities including LGBTIQ individuals and various ethnic and religious groups.\nEncompassing a post-conflict dimension too, particularly in the context of Ukraine, this topic aims to foster inclusive community policing practices that can adapt to the complexities of diverse societal dynamics. Proposals should explore innovative and inclusive approaches in police education, training and management that go beyond traditional models, resulting in an effective engagement with a diversifying society. Proposals should also seek to identify and develop effective practices and training programs that encourage a deeper understanding of diversity among police personnel and integrate a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach when relevant. In addition, proposals should assess how effective cooperation with Civil Society Organizations (or Non-Governmental Organisations) - representing various communities - can enhance reporting mechanisms, reduce hate crimes, and strengthen trust and cooperation between the police and the population. By improving police-citizen relations across diverse European contexts, the proposals should aim to contribute to enhanced security and social stability in Europe. Proposals’ findings should generate valuable insights applicable to varied policing environments, ultimately informing police forces across Europe about non-violent conflict resolution and constructive engagement strategies. Through collaborative research and training, proposals should equip Police Authorities with the tools, skills and methodologies necessary to effectively serve and engage with diverse communities, foster social cohesion, and build trust throughout Europe.\nActivities proposed within this topic should address the issue from various angles, combining social sciences with technological development and applications in a logical manner.\nTherefore, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Furthermore, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.",

      "scope": "This topic asks for proposals that seek to develop effective and evidence-based responses to the growing prevalence of synthetic drugs and stimulants, such as cocaine and crack cocaine, within the EU. As these substances increasingly influence the drug landscape, the urgent need for enhanced understanding and strategies in their prevention, treatment, and harm reduction has never been clearer. Amongst other, there is also a lack of pharmacological data for the emerging drugs, needed to do proper risk assessments and interventions of these drugs in Europe. Key focus areas include:\n- Evidence-based approaches, strengthening the evidence base to inform effective prevention strategies, treatment modalities, and harm reduction practices targeted at synthetic drugs and stimulants. This includes identifying best practices in current interventions and evaluating their efficacy.\n- Reducing violence and offending exploring strategies to mitigate the violence and criminal behaviour associated with the use and marketing of synthetic drugs. This involves understanding the socio-economic and cultural factors, including the gender, age, or other social factors, that contribute to these phenomena and proposing targeted interventions.\n- Improving technologies and tools to combat drug trafficking from its origin to destination (i.e., through the entire supply chain).\n- External drivers of change, analysing the impact of geopolitical situations, legal frameworks, and societal factors on the availability and consumption of various drugs, and addressing how international crises affect organised crime and drug markets in the EU. This includes investigating the repercussions of global developments on local drug dynamics and identifying adaptive response strategies.\nIn light of the underdeveloped evidence base surrounding synthetic drugs, proposals should aim to foster collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and security practitioners to create a comprehensive and effective response to this pressing issue in Europe, previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

      "scope": "The malicious use of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a known concern and technique used by offenders to retrieve personal, professional, and official or technical information about entities and their employees either to immediately plot illegal actions or use it to access more sensitive data with social engineering techniques like tailored data phishing. Although singular information may seem harmless, their critical mass coupled with reasoning and automated processing of large data blocks, could reveal critical vulnerabilities and possible attack vectors. This modus operandi is of special concern for critical infrastructure operators and authorities, as it can be used to aggregate sensitive information, identify potential protection gaps, discover the security measures, such as camera and sensor locations or target individuals with special access privileges in order to orchestrate more sophisticated and harmful attacks. OSINT can also be used to impede critical infrastructure operations indirectly, gathering information and affecting their supply chains.\nProposals submitted under this topic should analyse the type, amount and accessibility of publicly available information and their usefulness in planning hostile operations against critical entities and their services. They should also parse the role of OSINT for identification and recruitment of insiders, identity theft, impersonation, or launching psychological operations such as foreign information manipulation and interference or disinformation. Moreover, the implications of AI data processing to misuse OSINT potential should be addressed. Any potential OSINT sources should be covered including, but not limited to social media, online fora, cloud resources, public records and databases, lawfully accessible deep web and dark web data, geospatial information, as well as paper archives in the public domain with blueprints, emergency response plans or similar. Proposals should especially consider scenarios including hybrid threats and lone wolves and develop tools and awareness campaigns to mitigate such threats.\nProposals should build upon outcomes and tools of other relevant projects, adapting, optimising and integrating them when necessary to achieve the highest possible technology readiness level of the project results. The proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

      "scope": "Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.\nHowever, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and Intellectual Property (IP) valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.\nKnowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users, taking into account the urge to address the diverse needs of all citizens, regardless of gender, age or ability.\nApplicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:\n- Focus on mature technological solutions addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme;\n- Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries;\n- Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations;\n- Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.\nExamples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.\nThe participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.\nIt is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role [1] . If the coordinator is not an SME, this should be duly justified.\nThe projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.\nUnder this topic, projects should address one of the following areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme: Fighting Crime and Terrorism (FCT, Option A), Disaster-Resilient Society (DRS, Option B), Resilient Infrastructure (INFRA, Option C), Border Management (BM, Option D).\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the FCT area are: mobile forensics; deepfake detection; detection of counterfeiting (fake items, fake currency bills) or falsified/forged documents (passports, ID cards); detection and countering of advanced forms of malware, as well as non-cash payment frauds and other cyber-scams.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the DRS area are: data and satellite/remote sensing information exploitation, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance for disaster prevention.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the INFRA area are: physical access control, autonomous systems used for infrastructure protection, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance of environments and activities.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the BM area are: facilitated border checks; secure documents and identity management for border crossings; border surveillance; detection of drugs, explosives, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), weapons and/or other dangerous materials in customs environment; detection of stolen, smuggled, illicit or illegal goods (cigarettes, art, cultural goods, wildlife) in a customs environment.\nWhere relevant, proposals are invited to consider legal aspects to support the operationalization, policy integration, and institutional transformation of security solutions. This might include, for instance, the design of legal, policy, and/or standardization pathways to support the operational uptake of security solutions.\nThis topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP [2] ) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation” [3] . This topic contributes to the objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., to support the European industry and boost investment in critical technologies in Europe, and, to contribute to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] If a MIDCAP is included in the proposal, it could also take the role of coordinator.\n[2] OJ L, 2024/795, 29.2.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj\n[3] https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/index_en",

      "scope": "As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&D) services and innovative civil security technology solutions.\nProposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals are expected to include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise proposals that should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project.\nThe proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous Horizon Europe work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies . The proposals should provide clear evidence to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It should be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project. The tender process to be followed is described in Annex H.\nProposals should demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects should be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is recommendable to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:\n- Procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.\n- Launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.\n- Adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).\n- Foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).\nIn these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP [1] . In the first case, the procurers should foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers should foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users that are not part of the consortium (e.g. citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly hardware components, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.\nApplicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:\n- A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.\n- Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2026-2027, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call expects proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.\n- Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;\n- Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.\n- Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.\nApplicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] See General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.",

AI has a great potential to make task simpler by reducing the complexity offering intuitive interfaces and real-time feedback allowing workforce to be more efficient and effective while facilitating access to more complex tasks including those involving various forms of planning. AI can also adapt the interaction of automation with the worker taking into account particular needs of the human, including adaptation to the different abilities of the workers and facilitating inclusion. Finally, AI can be used to allow easier export of automation produced in EU by facilitating its interaction with workforce having different cultures adapting the interaction of the machines to the different needs.\nProposals should produce dedicated innovative AI approaches for human-machine collaboration in advanced manufacturing to be applied in at least two of following fields:\n- Human-AI Co-Learning and knowledge capture to share competences, capture expert knowledge, provide interactive mentoring to up-skill the workforce, and support re-qualification and continuous training – leading to increased knowledge at factory level and avoiding loss of know-how.\n- Human-AI teamwork thanks to innovative natural interaction models (considering the e.g. related hardware interfaces and/or collaborative machine tools), enabling to control complexity in cognitive cooperating production systems, including planning activities at shop floor level.\n- Interfaces with automation which automatically adapt to the need of the humans including different abilities and different cultural needs.\nProposals should integrate a gender perspective and avoid any type of discrimination in the design and deployment of AI systems and human-machine interaction models, including addressing differences in user needs, such as needs of persons with disabilities, physical and cognitive ergonomics and training pathways. Proposals are also expected to identify and address other potential biases in AI systems to promote inclusive design that ensures safe and effective use by all workers. Human/AI collaboration requires utmost sensitivity to and consideration of human values and consideration of ethical principles as represented in Digital Humanism, therefore, appropriate consideration must also be given to the contribution of SSH.\nThis topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nIn addition, proposals are invited to build on the results of past projects on Extended Reality Technologies (XR), such as HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-13, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-14, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-25, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-06, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-28.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.",

      "scope": "The term “Connected, Collaborative, Computing (3C) Network” refers to a telco-edge-cloud, secure multi-provider and multi-technology, communication system that hosts network functions and workloads for and beyond connectivity (e.g. 6G, AI Storage/Compute, networking, Security ISAC , and any other application or capability) as a service (aaS). Key features of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud network include programmability, fast service creation, security and privacy, mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain deployments. 3C/ telco-edge-cloud networks enable innovative use cases for an EU Digital Market that integrate communication, collaboration and computing capabilities in competitive and sustainable business models that will reinforce EU competitiveness and contribute to digital sovereignty, in particular through the use of Open Internet Stack components. Resulting solutions should be available for use in the public sector (for instance for justice systems).\nThe 3C Network large-scale pilot funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08: Large-scale pilots for supply end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities for Telco Edge Cloud deployments, as a basis for Connected Collaborative Computing Networks (3C networks) (RIA) is setting up end-to-end integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond. The main target is to research and validate the integration of device, network, cloud and edge computing, and communication capabilities for telco edge cloud deployments to realize a ubiquitous mesh of computing and communication resources. As a main outcome the supply side pilot establishes an open orchestration platform across the telco-cloud-edge continuum, exploits the transformative value of AI and builds on the integration of solutions developed by the Open Euro Stack.\nDemand- side pilot demonstrators called in this topic will build on the above supply side large-scale pilot and integrate future domain-specific applications and services with an emerging European 3Cs/ telco-edge-cloud infrastructure, leveraging different network features. Key features will include security and privacy solutions offering resistance to emerging quantum threats (such as via post-quantum cryptography), mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain and multi-cloud deployments and ecosystems.\nUp to two pilot demonstrators on below listed specific verticals are expected .\n- One pilot demonstrator focusing on Mobility covering specific areas of transport, logistics and the Automotive industry. The pilot should support the strategy as developed by the Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance identified in the Automotive Action plan , in particular Pillars 3 (AI models) and 5 (Large-scale testing), which will be launched in 2025.\n- One pilot demonstrator focusing on another vertical sector such as energy, smart communities, industrial virtual worlds, health, agrifood or manufacturing.\nThey would be driven by a consortium including partners both from the demand (user) and infrastructure supply side. The pilot demonstrators should take advantage of open application interfaces, explore the possibilities of AI, “virtual worlds”, and other innovative technologies for practical implementation in the referred vertical domains. They should leverage combined investments in network infrastructure, computing and connectivity infrastructure as an enabler for more extensive set of digital innovation, with cognitive cloud computing and swarm intelligence, generative AI and LLM, as well as on-boarding of XR/AR technologies, being ranked most important.\nProposals are expected to detail a robust data governance model for the data generated and processed within the pilots. This model should address data sovereignty, interoperability with Common European Data Spaces, and alignment with principles from initiatives like Gaia-X. It should outline clear mechanisms for secure and compliant data sharing between the demand-side (users) and supply-side (infrastructure providers), establishing the trust necessary for a functional data economy on top of the 3C infrastructure.\nPilot demonstrators should demonstrate the evolution from virtualised and cloud-native network functions towards automated network operations enabling agile and green IoT-edge computing solutions and decentralised intelligence. They should also demonstrate benefits for infrastructure providers to operate networks more efficiently and move beyond traditional connectivity-service models to higher value-added services.\nDemonstrations will respond to the ever more demanding processing power of AI through integration on-device level and changes triggered by GenAI affecting global communication infrastructures. Orchestration of workloads across the telco-cloud-edge continuum from distributed sensors and actuators to the edge and cloud is a crucial part of innovation as AI becomes more resource-intensive.\nThe pilot demonstrators should take into consideration the recommendations on user requirements from the advisory group of end users, as well as liaise with the collaboration and support action (CSA) funded under WP25 to bridge between the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply pilot funded under WP25 and the demand pilots funded under WP26-27.\nThe pilots should exploit in particular open APIs and open-source components as developed by the supply side pilot, e.g. including the use of capabilities to implement specific communication management services (e.g. Open RAN security, RIC VNF…), up-take of existing standards and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, ANUKET, Nephio, CAMARA, etc.).\nThe pilot demonstrators should include testing, validation and demonstration of prototypes of agile virtualised network functions combined with ubiquitous mesh of integrated devices, computing and communication resources in operational environments, ensuring security and privacy, protection also in the face of emerging quantum threats, energy efficiency, transparency and control of the ecological footprint, as well as sustainable artificial intelligence services.\nThe pilot demonstrators are expected to re-use as far as possible existing open-source frameworks, i.e. open-source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key technology components for the operation of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply-side large scale pilot. These open-source frameworks should be made available to the Open Internet Stack Support for Scale.\nThe proposals should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant vertical sectors, with a particular attention to the involvement of SMEs, scale-ups and start-ups.\nThe pilots should establish a high degree of relations and collaborate with complementary EU funded research activities, like the Smart Networks and Systems Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) projects, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Sovereign edge/cloud infrastructure” R&I areas, the PPP virtual worlds, CCAM partnership as well as support of SW-defined vehicle initiative under the Chips JU.",

This includes intelligent workload scheduling and AI model optimisation techniques to reduce energy use (e.g. carbon-aware job scheduling and power capping to cut energy demand and peak temperatures), as well as designs for integrating on-site/off-site renewables and waste-heat reuse.\n- As a result of all the above bullet points, an open pilot demonstration site that allows for the testing and integration of the outcomes of these projects and serves as the European reference for showcasing the breakthroughs and cutting-edge technologies for energy-efficient and sustainable data centres developed under this topic. This site should serve as a model for technology uptake for the European data centre industry.\nOutcomes should demonstrate potential for improved power usage effectiveness and utilisation of waste heat in external applications, aligned with European targets for carbon-neutral heating/cooling.",
      "scope": "Actions should address the following development areas:\n- Direct on-chip cooling and thermal management, including novel and innovative cooling techniques applied at chip and module level (direct liquid cooling, heat spreaders, thermal interface materials, and advanced packaging) and multi-scale thermal management techniques.\n- Energy-efficient power backup and storage systems: Innovations in early-stage energy storage concepts (graphene-enhanced batteries, supercapacitors, and other emerging battery chemistries) and approaches for net-zero backup.\n- Sustainable data centre architectures and AI workload optimization: addressing AI-driven workload scheduling, adaptive power management, dynamic resource allocation and integration of data centre heat capture and reuse.\n- Materials research for energy efficiency: Projects to make use of existing research in new materials and components supporting energy efficiency and thermal management, and to employ these for data centres benefit.\n- Optimisation of data centre operation and functioning: explore AI solutions to optimize the Data centre functioning, computing architecture, and virtualization, minimizing its carbon and environmental footprint.\n- Integration of data centres into energy systems and the wider region: including solutions that integrate Data centres into energy system planning and operation.\nAside from these, the pilot demonstration site must allow to combine the outcomes supplied by the other funded projects in the topic and enable for showcasing, benchmarking, and promoting their results across interested industrial stakeholders, including the European data centre and collocation industry, as well as other AI data centre operators, such as cloud and edge computing providers.\nOverall, this topic is expected to fund four projects. Three projects are expected to address expected outcomes 1-3, while a fourth project is expected for expected outcome 4 (the open pilot demonstration site). For projects addressing expected outcomes 1-3 at least two use cases should showcase each project results.\nBeneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 5 HORIZON-CL5-2027-05-D4-06: Thermal energy optimisation and waste heat recovery of high energy demand IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres.",

It lays down targeted measures to boost AI use in key strategic sectors of the EU economy including healthcare, mobility and manufacturing for example. With challenges designed to spark breakthroughs in such strategic sectors, the current topic will directly support key activities of the Apply AI Strategy.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI Strategy's prioritised sectors driven by challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions.\n- Increase competitiveness and visibility of the relevant AI community within key application domains, and promote collaborative approaches for AI development in these domains, fostering the ecosystem.\n- Increase adoption of AI technologies across the following three key application domains: healthcare, advanced manufacturing (including AI-powered robotics) and in-vehicle autonomous driving.",
      "scope": "The Challenge-Driven AI Innovation Booster aims to drive significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI prioritised sectors through challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions. This initiative seeks to boost Europe's developer community and the adoption of powerful, trustworthy AI solutions in three strategic domains such as:\n- In healthcare - advanced AI will accelerate diagnostics and treatment plans, enhance robotic surgery, or improve patient care through predictive analytics.\n- In advanced manufacturing - advanced AI will optimize production processes, improve quality control and product design, or enable predictive maintenance.\n- In autonomous driving - advanced AI will enhance vehicle safety, improve navigation systems, or optimize traffic management. Provided sufficient quality of the proposals received, at least one selected project will focus on in-vehicle autonomous driving applications, in line with the Automotive Action Plan, ensuring coordination with the announced Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above.\nIt is expected to focus primarily on the definition and organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as on the accompanying support to the SMEs/teams taking part in each of the challenges.\nUser-industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in each consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and therefore support the challenge participants to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefiting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive, but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan focused on how the solutions developed by the third parties will be taken up, with support from the user-industry partners for their future exploitation.\nThe consortium leading the project is responsible for the various stages of the challenges. This consortium should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition (including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy) and, most importantly, the consortium should ensure that the teams competing for and receiving financial support to third parties have access to relevant data to fine-tune models and build high-impact solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where advanced AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with advanced AI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, each project consortium should organize a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small teams of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with advanced AI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\nStage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection for Stage 2 of the 10 highest-ranked proposals according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution is expected to be submitted either by a single SME, developer of advanced AI solutions, or a small team of organizations led by such SME.\nStage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive a EUR 300,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest-ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 – Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,250,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best-performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch a multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, and propose a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants in the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organizing the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organizing dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalized by a collaboration agreement after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, a total of EUR 3,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, EUR 9,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives and expected results. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore, dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.\n[1] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy",

The project will aim at disseminating a deep understanding of state-of-the-art robotics components, including both hardware and software, and expertise in addressing interoperability issues for the upskilling of system integrators.\nTo maximise the impact and adaptability of deployed systems, the approach should consider the most appropriate tools to speed up integration processes and suitable AI design, training and inference methodologies, ensuring scalability, transferability, transparency, robustness, flexibility, and real-world applicability in diverse industrial environments, and should remain adaptable to the latest technological developments.\nIntegration frameworks will promote the use of energy-efficient AI models and hardware ('Green AI'), alongside carbon-aware deployment and operational strategies for robotic system. Where relevant, projects should contribute to open and widely recognised standards to foster interoperability and uptake across the robotics ecosystem. To enhance safety and performance, projects may include high-fidelity simulation environments or digital twins as testbeds for training, validation and verification, with measures to ensure smooth transfer from simulation to real-world deployment.\nBy bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users, these integrators will enable the creation of seamless, reliable and scalable robotics systems that can be easily adopted by industries, especially SMEs, thereby supporting more flexible and efficient production processes.\nThe project is expected to deliver:\n- A deployable, modular integration framework, validated through at least three real-world industrial pilots covering different reference scenarios to demonstrate that the approach can be adapted to varied industrial needs and company sizes, including both SMEs and larger manufacturers. This framework should provide, for example, a common software layer, standard interfaces to connect to existing workflow and legacy system, possibly also to connect various robot components, coordinate multiple robots and link them with additional AI tools and IoT environments, as well as tested configuration templates and clear guidelines to ensure safe and efficient use.\n- An Integration Kit, building on this framework, which offers ready-to-use modules, example configurations and practical tools that help system integrators and companies to set up, test and run AI-enabled robotics solutions more quickly and with reduced technical effort.\n- Where relevant, high-fidelity digital twin testbeds should be linked to each pilot, allowing safe and realistic testing and training before deployment, and supporting a smooth transition from virtual models to actual production lines.\n- Reusable, datasets (compliant with relevant regulation and IP protection) and practical benchmark tasks, made available to the wider robotics and AI community, to support further development and comparison of new solutions while respecting European data protection rules.\n- A clear Step-by-Step Adoption Guide aimed at SMEs and other end-users, providing easy-to-follow instructions, practical checklists and examples to help companies plan, budget and implement AI-driven robotics in a safe and cost-effective way, even if they have limited in-house expertise, and including guidance to navigate regulatory compliance and certification.\n- Concrete contributions to relevant open standards and clear guidance on certification pathways, to help ensure compliance with European regulations and build trust in the safe use of AI in robotics. Projects are expected to make full use of existing robotics resources and assets made available through the AI-on-Demand Platform, such as the EuroCORE repository and other relevant shared tools, to maximise synergies, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure broad dissemination and reuse of results within the European AI and robotics community.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA.",

      "expected_outcome": "The Apply AI Strategy [1] also seeks to bolster EU capabilities and achieve excellence in AI to support the development of European frontier models. As part of the Frontier AI Initiative, which brings together Europe’s leading actors in the field, this topic will support the development of sovereign frontier AI ensuring safety by design. This topic directly contributes to the Apply AI Strategy. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Strengthened European capabilities in the development of frontier AI models.\n- Improved computational efficiency of frontier AI models, resulting in reduced computational costs.\n- Enhanced safety of advanced AI systems based on frontier AI models through the development and implementation of safe-by-design principles and/or AI agents acting as safety evaluators.",
      "scope": "To advance developments of frontier AI models towards highest-level performance, while ensuring energy efficiency, addressing computational constraints, and strengthening safety. The approach of this topic is twofold. First, it aims to advance the AI field through the development and training of a frontier AI model. The AI model should demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, have multimodal capabilities, and be optimized for agentic AI capabilities such as tool use, reasoning, and autonomous problem-solving. Second, this topic supports research on comprehensive methods to reduce the computational demands of frontier AI models and to ensure their safety, including technical methodologies such as automated testing and interpretability.\nThe primary drivers behind computational efficient AI systems are the urgent challenges posed by the growing energy footprint of AI and current computational limitations. Modern AI models, especially frontier AI models, require substantial computational resources, with a significant impact in the environment. Additionally, they create barriers to entry to those interested in advancing the AI field. Key research areas include compression and distillation techniques aimed at reducing the complexity of large AI models. Innovations in AI architectures are also relevant, with a focus on innovative models that significantly lower computational demands for training and inference. Further, algorithmic approaches aimed at minimizing computational load during pre-training, post-training, and inference can also be considered.\nEnsuring the safety of AI systems is essential, especially as AI models become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. Potential research areas to be considered include addressing misalignment, particularly the unintentional misalignment of large AI models. Work in this area could explore methods to detect and mitigate sophisticated misbehaviour, such as alignment faking, reward hacking of human oversight, and encoded reasoning in chain-of-thought (CoT). Additionally, research could focus on enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, jailbreaks, and backdoors. Further potential areas for innovation include advancing AI models transparency and interpretability. Safety research could also consider risks that may arise when embedding frontier models within agentic AI frameworks, significantly contributing to the trust and safe adoption of powerful AI solutions.\nThis topic contributes to the EU Frontier AI initiative. The project should establish strong links with the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE), ensuring that its priorities inform the research topics addressed. Activities are expected to involve the European AI research community and attract and retain top AI talent working on frontier models and related areas.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform.\nThe project selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories and the Data Labs. Where relevant, it could also establish links with European companies developing frontier AI models.\nAll proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with the European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA) and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\n[1] COM(2025)723 Apply AI Strategy",

      "scope": "CCAM solutions are expected to provide a more user-centred, inclusive mobility system that enhances safety, reduces congestion, lowers harmful emissions, and contributes to decarbonization. In addition, CCAM solutions enhance transport effectiveness, thereby strengthening Europe's competitiveness in the global mobility sector. Novel mobility services can enable seamless integration with existing services such as public transport and logistics, while higher levels of automation are expected to boost transport productivity and efficiency. However, the benefits of these solutions must be proven through large-scale demonstrations, validating their effectiveness for both people and goods. It is also of key importance to integrate and test enabling vehicle technologies and to validate trusted communication and cyber security, as well as real time information transmission. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of technology maturity is necessary, evaluating the readiness of automated driving functions within mixed traffic conditions and in confined areas. This evaluation helps determine the readiness of automation technologies for deployment, considering factors such as operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and user acceptance. By fostering a systematic approach to large-scale demonstrations, technology validation, and maturity assessment, and by prioritising zero-emission mobility, these efforts contribute to the seamless integration of CCAM solutions across the entire public and private transport ecosystem.\nThe proposed action is expected to demonstrate different CCAM solutions and technologies in all the following domains:\n- Individual mobility within mixed traffic environments, encompassing urban, suburban, motorway, and rural settings, with a focus on the seamless integration of automated and conventional vehicles. Use cases should consider diverse road conditions, infrastructure variability, traffic dynamics, and user needs, ensuring safe, efficient, accessible and user-centric mobility solutions. A key aspect is the integration of advanced technologies (e.g. AI, V2X, cybersecurity, precise positioning, etc.) and the validation of technological enablers ensuring that automation solutions are robust, scalable, and adaptable to all CCAM use cases for people and goods.\n- Shared mobility and public transport operations in urban, regional and rural areas, for end-to-end journeys aiming to enhance safety, accessibility, equity, and sustainability, including improving business cases for mobility providers.

      "scope": "Pilots and demonstrations using Level 3 and 4 vehicle services face major challenges in perception and decision making, highlighting the necessity for low-latency solutions that enhance responsiveness and situational awareness in real-time operating conditions. This is especially relevant for driving in more complex environments like urban areas, where environmental variance is higher and where new scenarios can be regularly encountered. Furthermore, there is the need to limit the latency, bandwidth and energy use for on-board calculations, as well as the need to enhance the security, privacy and reliability (e.g. scene understanding and prediction of near-future scenario development). For rapid decision-making in interactions with VRUs, this is essential for implementing CCAM-enabled solutions and ensuring scalability.\nAt the same time, developments of sector-agnostic technologies show advancements -such as GenAI- that can be beneficial for CCAM. First exploratory steps can be expected from a project funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 [1] regarding the potential in the virtual generation of edge cases, which could be used for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems.\nFurther advancements in GenAI applications specifically for the CCAM domain need to be developed, trained and validated [2] . Thus, proposed actions shall include approaches to exploit further technological advancements for CCAM. Major steps are needed to advance to highly advanced, ultra-safe, trustworthy and energy efficient real-time perception and decision-making systems for automated vehicles, specifically focusing on scalable solutions and the exploitation of GenAI. These advancements should leverage low latency systems or distributed computing resources to facilitate real-time processing, thereby improving system responsiveness and safety. This topic will thus contribute to the AI Continent Action Plan [3] by fostering AI development and adoption in the automotive sector.\nProposed actions are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Development of tools and approaches for robust environment perception and decision making (at the edge, on-board, at infrastructure or back-office). These approaches shall aim at accelerating and advancing the reasoning of decision making, increasing the level of efficiency, (cyber)-security and reliability of the applications, with path planning as initial use case. This is to support amongst others the perception of VRUs, the prediction of their behaviour and their intentions, and includes data sharing approaches for CCAM solutions to create a larger time window for actions in near accident scenarios. The use of advanced GenAI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) or Vision Language Action (VLAs) can significantly enhance these capabilities by leveraging their advanced contextual reasoning and pattern recognition. Furthermore, GenAI can complement existing perception systems by improving sensory input interpretation and providing enriched environmental contexts, which enhance decision-making and adaptability.\n- Scenario generation of interactions of CCAM enabled vehicles with other road users, which is essential for advances in validation and testing, extending existing datasets and scenarios as GenAI can, based on existing data, deliver variations of scenarios (e.g. cultural differences of road users and infrastructure variability.)\n- Integration of GenAI technologies into existing approaches (development, training and validation) for their further enrichment. Understanding the limits of using GenAI technologies as well as the benefits and develop guidelines for valid approaches for this integration (including consideration of gender biases and fairness to ensure AI systems are transparent and accountable) and providing an outlook on the uptake of the tools and approaches developed can be done for a variety of CCAM components and technologies, as well as for systemic applications such as traffic management and remote control.\n- Encouraging collaboration with the European Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative by adopting existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework.\nProposed actions should include measures to ensure close coordination with the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European Automotive Action Plan.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

Furthermore, improving system resilience requires better tools and solutions for multimodal operators to manage disruptions and ensure supply chain continuity.\nBuilding on the results of previously funded research projects and initiatives (including e.g. the Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking), proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Building on data governance models set in the European Data Act, Common European Data Spaces and the electronic Freight Transport Information Regulation, develop interoperable tools and solutions integrated in existing platforms and solutions (also leveraging the full potential of e.g. Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and other emerging technologies) used by shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, warehouse operators, distribution centres, retailers and e-commerce platforms to connect with multimodal information (e.g. services, visibility, ETA, etc.). Developing any type of digital platform or similar is outside the scope of this topic. The proposed tools and solutions should also help operators to react rapidly to disruptions, considering strategies and alternatives for cases of failure, accidents, sabotage, force majeure, etc.\n- Map and identify datasets available or to be developed to enhance the integration of multimodal solutions in other supply chain processes (e.g. rail timetable information). Assess how new technologies (e.g. generative Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things) could be leveraged and applied, including, but not limited to, the procurement and management of smart containers (e.g. for real-time monitoring of cargo conditions, ETA). Explore synchromodality strategies for logistics hubs and multimodal transport networks.\n- Based on the business and technical requirements (e.g. transport management systems, data structures, data security) of both freight forwarders and shippers, develop interoperable solutions and tools to support freight forwarders and multimodal operators to address shippers’ demands in terms of information provision and sharing, including as regards logistic hubs and first / last mile connections.\n- Define use cases for multimodal transport for intra-European flows between 500 and 1,000 km (from first to last mile delivery), and collaborative business model(s) to shift freight transport demand to multimodal solutions.\n- Validate, measure the performance and demonstrate the proposed solutions and concepts in 2 large pilots along segments of the main European freight transport corridors, ensuring geographical balance and covering various types of industrial sectors (e.g. fast-moving consumer goods industry). The pilots should be carried out with the involvement and cooperation of relevant transport operators, logistic companies and infrastructure managers.\n- Assess and quantify the value generation (also in terms of sustainability and energy consumption reduction) of the proposed solutions for the shippers, multimodal operators and terminals.\n- Analyse and propose recommendations for contingency plans to address disruptions in multimodal supply chains.\n- Provide recommendations on possible revisions to the existing regulatory framework and propose initiatives to remove existing barriers to and facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of multimodal transport solutions.\nProposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan. Information exchange with Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking Flagship Area 5 is advised to avoid duplicated research.\nIf the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.",

      "scope": "With more than 50% of all EU road fatalities occurring in rural areas along with evidence suggesting that crashes and crash-related fatalities in rural roads vary from those in urban roads or motorways, it is imperative to understand and mitigate the safety risks in rural roads in view of the EU’s ambition to move towards Vision Zero by 2050. Local and regional authorities have an important role to play to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries.\nIn the EU, the Road Infrastructure Safety Management (RISM) Directive introduced the concept of network-wide road safety assessment (NWRSA) and the concept of proactive road safety assessment through the understanding of the in-built safety of roads. Considering safety at the network-level allows for an overview of the road safety performance instead of focusing on isolated parts of it, while the in-built safety assessment aims to identify parts of the road that have been omitted by crash-based analyses (such crash clusters or hotspot analysis) as they do not concentrate the majority of crashes, yet are crash-prone and/or uncomfortable to navigate. According to the provisions of the RISM Directive, a methodology has been developed to assess the network-wide safety of motorways and primary rural roads based on their combined crash-based and in-built safety assessments. While this is a first step in understanding road safety conditions on rural roads, secondary and lower-class roads are not covered and, at the same time, there is not adequate information on road user behaviour.\nIn an ageing society, cognitive and physical impairments pose an increasing threat to safe mobility. In rural areas, people with any kind of impairment or disability often lack alternatives to driving a car for their mobility needs. Addressing these issues will not only enhance road safety but also improve the quality of life and prevent the social exclusion of these people.\nIn addition to road safety issues, local and regional authorities manage risks associated with extreme weather phenomena and other natural disasters like floods, fires, storms or heavy snowfall. As these may affect safety and operations, relevant authorities need to adopt a more holistic resilience monitoring and response.\nResearch should support addressing these challenges by undertaking all the following actions in at least three regions covering both primary and secondary rural roads of adequate length to allow for region-level comparisons:\n- Demonstrate the practical applicability of the NWRSA methodology and expand its use to all rural roads for an easy, low-cost, flexible and transparent, yet sufficiently accurate assessment of road infrastructure safety. Identify information gaps and propose methods to leverage available data to supplement the understanding of crash causation and outcomes.\n- Develop prevention strategies and measures to reduce fatalities and serious injuries in rural areas with a focus on high-risk locations and situations and on improving road user behaviour. This includes the development of reliable and easy-to-use methods to provide quantified indications of the actual crash risk associated with and the prevalence of risky behaviours. Based on this, enforcement measures with evidence-based effectiveness in addressing the problems and motivations underlying risky behaviour should be proposed, combining traditional methods with innovative enforcement approaches and new technologies, also taking into account the issue of multi-offenders[[ A small group of repeat offenders account for a large share of crashes (e.g. 5% in population vs. 27% in crashes according to SWOV 2017 Progressief boetestelsel ) and intoxication by drugs ( Recent studies show that the share of crash-involved drivers intoxicated by drugs equals or even surpasses those intoxicated by alcohol [ Gjerde & Forst 2023 ].]]. These enforcement measures, complemented by suitable awareness raising and nudging measures as well as novel incentive mechanisms to promote safe driving, will form building blocks to design integrated strategies fostering safer behaviour according to the local needs and specificities of rural areas. A gender and disability sensitive and intersectional approach, which intersects with other social factors, could be considered. Crash prevention strategies should also include countermeasures to reduce the effects of health-related risk factors and to guarantee at the same time the mobility of older people and persons with health impairments in rural areas.\n- Develop tools to make knowledge about climate-related risks easily accessible to local authorities and to enable them to take appropriate actions in order to maintain road safety and the resilience of the rural road network and of the infrastructure for road users even in extreme conditions [1] .\nProjects should select those regions ensuring diversity in terms of road network design, geography and climate conditions, and road safety culture. At least two of those regions should be in countries with higher percentage of fatalities on rural roads than the EU average. The involvement of road authorities is strongly recommended.\n[1] Such tools may be based on results from projects under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11 (effects of disruptive changes in transport) as well as on other thorough analyses of how such situations were managed in the past and what can be improved.",

      "scope": "Passenger transport systems are a critical component of urban, sub-urban, and long-distance travel, facilitating connectivity, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting environmental sustainability. However, these systems face challenges such as operational disruptions, safety and security risks, and evolving passenger demands.\nIn the context of passenger transport, resilience refers to the ability of a transport system to absorb disturbances, maintain its basic structure and function, and recover to a required level of service within acceptable time and cost after being affected by disruption. This involves implementing measures that ensure continuous operation, quick recovery from unexpected events, and adaptability to changing circumstances. Enhanced resilience is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring smooth functioning of transport systems and it is a cornerstone of the EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Development and implementation of measures to enhance the resilience of urban, sub-urban and long-distance transport systems.\n- Leveraging digital technologies (e.g. big data, digital twins) and in particular generative and discriminative AI for anticipating and predicting the evolution of disruptions and their impacts, with real-time planning and information systems for minimizing impact and enabling faster recovery.\n- Use of innovative technologies for data acquisition and integrate data from various sources to inform decision-making and optimise strategies, and generate scenario libraries for different disruptive events and monitor the implementation of the response plans\n- Involve authorities and operators in the design process to create holistic solutions that are user-friendly and aligned with their needs.\n- Conducting safety and security assessments in data interpretation, ensuring decisions are based on objective factors while avoiding biases.\n- Test and validate the aspects above in real-life use cases in multimodal transport corridor within urban, sub-urban and long-distance passenger transport with minimum three transport modes per use cases (e.g. buses, metros, trams, trains, coaches, trolleybuses, ferries, share mobility) in at least three pilot sites situated in different Member States and reflecting a diversity of operational, geographic, and technological contexts.\nProposals are encouraged to building on results from previous calls on infrastructure and transport resilience (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11, MG-7-1-2017, HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-09), multimodal traffic management (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-05, MG-2-11-2020), shared mobility and public transport (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-04, HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-02).

      "scope": "An exceptional effort is needed to develop, demonstrate and de-risk essential renewable fuels technologies and establish their industrial value chains in a cost-effective way to cover the EU needs where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution. Proposals should steer the development of these technologies at EU level and bring them to the market. Pre-commercial procurement of R&D, validation and possibly, first deployment of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies is considered an effective tool to de-risk such activities and overcome the “valley of death” because real take off by engaging primarily concerned contracting entities is expected. The scope of this action is to design and bring industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies at TRL 8 by the action end. The competitive development in phases of entire industrial value chains should built upon existing knowledge on technology and value chain readiness based on existing EU projects and studies, thus speeding up the de-risking.\n‘Transnational buyers’ could be public plus possibly one or more private procurers, and that provide similar services of public interest. The buyers will collectively develop and implement the pre-commercial procurement of R&D services from a number of providers and designate a lead procurer to award the contracts. The procurement must be open to providers of R&D services established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.\nInclusiveness of a broad range of public and private procures across EU and Associated Countries and across national borders is encouraged, to effectively share the risk and benefit from creating in the EU market readiness of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies. Public and private EU airport and port authorities and their respective managing bodies, aircraft operators and shipping companies, other state, regional or local authorities and bodies governed by public law or their associations, are some examples of expected public [1] and private procurers with an incentive to improve solutions in areas of public interest, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply as fuels.\nThe consortium is encouraged to plan activities during the project to raise awareness to the R&D providers that will win PCP contracts about unlocking and increasing their investment capacity in the field of renewable fuel technologies, for example by using possible combinations of the PCP procurement contract with additional support for companies from the EIC, InvestEU, regional funds or possibly other sources of Union funding. Participation of public contracting authorities and entities managing or funding such funds in the project is encouraged. In addition, the procurers should include in the proposal what will be their planned approach for deployment in case the PCP results in successful solutions; this could be through a combination of deploying a limited set of solutions already during the PCP project and/or foreseeing a deliverable that prepares follow-up procurement to purchase (larger volumes of) such type of solution(s) after the PCP.\nEssential value chains to de-risk should be based on identified technologies by our studies [2] (i) – vii) below) as those that can contribute essentially to domestic commercial fuel production beyond 2030, and possibly other that can be demonstrated at commercial scale by the end of the execution phase of the project [3] :\n- Production of advanced bioEthanol and further processing into ATJ-SPK\n- Biomass Gasification and FT-Synthesis to produce FT-SPK\n- Production of BioMethanol for further processing into MTJ\n- Hydrotreatment of Lipids from marginal/contaminated lands to produce HEFA\n- Biomass Pyrolysis and Upgrading or co-processing to produce biokerosene and bio-heavy fuel oil\n- Biomethane from AD and Gasification and Methanation to produce biomethane for shipping or further processing into methanol (methanolysis) for shipping\n- E-Methanol production from CO2 and renewable H2 for shipping\nIndustrial value chains of the essential renewable fuel technologies should be developed based on domestic sustainable feedstocks across EU and Associated Countries and on also creating synergies across all end use energy and transport sectors for markets and production facilities for renewable fuels.\nHydrogen production as end-product is not in scope.\n[1] Public contracting authorities and entities as defined in REGULATION (EU) 2021/695, Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU\n[2] a) Study on Development of Outlook for the Necessary Means to Build Industrial Capacity for Drop-in Advanced Biofuels - European Commission , b) How To Mobilize Industrial Capacity Building For Advanced Biofuels\n[3] All hydrogen used to the production of the synthetic fuels should comply with the EU legislation on the renewable and low carbon methodology, i.e. the processes of Steam Methane Reforming using fossil fuels for the production are out of the scope, as there is no RI associated to these methods.",

      "scope": "Demonstration of a viable regional value chain for the use of locally to regionally sourced sustainable and cheap solid biofuel from upgraded biogenic residues and wastes in line with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive in high efficiency CHP plants (between 10 MWe and 30 MWe) for continuous, cost-effective and low emission operation.\nProposals are expected to cover long-term scenarios for base load operation within the energy system network ensuring socio-economic and environmental sustainability and in particular the exclusion of negative impacts on other regional bio-based value chains and biomass uses in line with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive (also on cascading use), biodiversity, water balance, air quality and soil carbon stocks and other bioeconomy sectors which should be assessed by a comprehensive life cycle analysis. For this purpose, the extraction of residues should respect locally defined retention thresholds for deadwood extraction and exclude negative impacts on soil quality and soil carbon\nTo minimise possible local ecosystem interferences, biomass fuels from residues and wastes are expected to be the primary feedstock of the high-efficiency CHP plant. The biomass fuels are expected to be produced with the use of innovative preprocessing and upgrading technologies and through the adoption of advanced supply chains from a mixture of residues and wastes and exclude negative impacts not only overall, but in each individual harvest location, which results in specific operational, economic and logistical and supply chain challenges to be addressed. Proposals should foresee at least one regional value chain demonstration including use of the solid biofuel with verified quality and occurring GHG and air-pollutant reduction in an operational high efficiency CHP plant. Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of feedstock providers (e.g. farmers, foresters, municipalities) to strengthen their position in the value chains relevant for this topic.\nProposals are expected to demonstrate ways for future efficient, cost-effective, robust, resilient and low pollution CHP plants (including retrofitting and excluding co-firing with fossil fuels) in a local industrial context.\nPlans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. In this respect, collaboration with suitable networks like e.g. bioenergy clusters should be envisaged to avoid the development of overly site-specific solutions and to enhance replicability. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG and air pollutant emissions reduction potential; projects will be encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs including the overall industrial ecosystem at the place of deployment. Projects are encouraged to support the reconstruction of Ukraine by covering regional value chains in Ukraine and/or Ukrainian beneficiaries.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, SSH research should look specifically at how synergies can be enhanced to achieve the topic’s objective in respect of socioeconomic sustainability. A gender-sensitive and intersectional approach can inform the development of inclusive solutions in solid biofuel supply and CHP, by identifying specific needs, developing solutions that address these needs, and monitoring their impacts on diverse groups.",

Optimizing system designs and business practices will help to enable simultaneous land use creating synergy for both agriculture and electricity production; this can benefit farmers, lower PV costs and enable the European Union to reach the goals of the EU solar energy strategy.\nSimilarly, offshore/nearshore PV systems represent a tremendous deployment potential in Europe and globally, due to their advantages in conserving land resources and optimizing light utilization. However, prevailing technical challenges limit deployment in most sea conditions usually found in Europe.\nProject results are therefore expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, depending on the proposed system (agriPV or offshore/nearshore PV):\n- Harvesting of crops and photovoltaic electricity, providing sustainable solutions for energy production/use/efficiency, soil and biodiversity protection and water conservation.\n- Reinforce the European PV value chain, introduce new business models and open new markets for novel, bankable agri or offshore/nearshore PV systems.\n- Minimise the impact of PV on landscape/sea and environment exploiting its modularity and synergies of use. Promote offshore wind and PV co-location and system integration.\n- Significant improvement of designs that reduce both CAPEX and OPEX, maximize energy output and thus reduce LCoE.\n- Promote integrated and multi-dimensional policy design to overcome socio-technical challenges for agri and offshore/nearshore PV deployment.",

These dimensions need to be addressed holistically with the involvement of policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities working towards a just and equitable deployment of agriPV.

Concentrated solar thermal technologies offer a great potential to supply renewable heat for industry for temperatures between 150°C - 400°C. Nevertheless, efforts are still required to demonstrate these technologies for a variety of industrial processes.\nProposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:\n- Showcase the capacity of concentrated solar thermal systems to largely meet the heat demand of industrial processes and to achieve a yearly solar fraction of at least 50%.\n- Increase competitiveness of concentrated solar thermal for industrial applications. This is to be proven by an economically feasible business case; by reducing the Levelised Cost of Heating (LCoH); and by valorising and promoting the competitive advantages of the technology such as heat storage, flexibility, and energy security.",
      "scope": "The proposals are expected to demonstrate concentrated solar technologies for heat production (within the 150°C - 400°C range), combined with storage, feeding the generated heat to existing heating and/or cooling processes in industry, e.g., drying, melting, sterilisation, refrigeration, etc.\nThe proposals are expected to efficiently integrate the solar heat system in the selected industrial application. To a possible extent, the proposals should optimise energy efficiency and heat recovery of the industrial process to maximise the coverage of the heat demand by the solar system and to ensure an efficient solar investment. Hybridisation with other on-site renewable energy technologies could be considered. However, the core solutions are expected to focus on the concentrated solar thermal part and not on the industrial process or on the hybrid renewable energy technologies.\nThe proposed solution is expected to be demonstrated in all possible solar incidence, and for a continuous period of at least 6 months. The replicability potential to other industrial processes should also be taken into account.\nThe proposals are expected to address the techno-economic feasibility and the environmental impact of the proposed systems, as well as specific issues related to the integration of the solar systems in the industrial process such as surface availability.\nThe proposal is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone before entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project is expected to submit: i) a proof of solid engagement of the industrial demonstration party, ii) all needed permits for deployment, iii) credible and detailed engineering plans, and iv) a complete business and implementation plan.\nThe use of the European Research Infrastructure for concentrated solar power EU-SOLARIS is encouraged but not mandatory.",

      "scope": "Following the revamp of the SET Plan and its anchoring to the NZIA and the European Research Area, it becomes urgent to boost the R&I activities envisaged already under the SET Plan Implementation Plans and their further updates and contribute towards pooling diverse resources to increase the R&I funding and impact across the European Research Area. This action is complementary to existing projects and instruments like the Clean Energy Technology (CET) Partnership [1] with the vision to support, facilitate and reinforce that work by providing a focused programming framework and coordinated network of active and connected stakeholders in renewable fuels.\nThis action aims to create connected regional renewable fuel value chain activities across Europe, involving regions with lower innovation performances, by sharing and transferring capacities and know-how. The challenge is to overcome fragmentation of the value chains where different regions have different capacities (feedstock, technology, skills) and create collaboration at EU, national, regional or local level to collectively develop and implement complete value chains of renewable fuel technologies.\nThe action should contribute to the implementation of the Implementation Plan [2] and its updated version(s) of the Implementation Working Group of Renewable fuels and Bioenergy under the revamped SET Plan. All renewable fuel technologies, both of biological and non-biological origin, at all TRL levels and market up-take measures, which are listed in this Implementation Plan and its updated version(s), but also new identified interregional and transnational challenges across these value chains, are within scope, including for example feedstock standardization, permitting fragmentation and lack of fit-for-purpose business models in rural regions, and using artificial intelligence as appropriate. Activities should draw from the detailed R&I activities program of the Implementation Plan of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy (Annex I) regarding development, demonstration (also at pilot scale) and scale-up of\n- Advanced liquid and gaseous biofuels [3] through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and/or from autotrophic microorganisms and primary renewable energy.\n- Other renewable liquid and gaseous fuels [3] (with particular attention to direct solar and algae-based fuels but excluding hydrogen as end-product) through thermochemical/ chemical /biochemical /electrochemical transformation of energy neutral carriers (like CO2 or N2) with renewable energy.\n- Solid, liquid and gaseous intermediate bioenergy carriers through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and further upgrading to advanced biofuels\ntaking into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, the European Technology and Innovation Platform on Bioenergy (ETIP Bioenergy), the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) Bioenergy Joint Programme and the SET Plan Direct Solar Fuel forum as its SRIA becomes available.\nThe action may support networking and coordination, research and innovation, pilot actions, market uptake measures, training and mobility, awareness raising and communication, and dissemination and exploitation across an entire value chain of renewable fuel technologies, thus providing the highest possible flexibility for activities in supporting the related challenges. The action should establish a joint comprehensive plan of activities. The range of activities supported should include an appropriate set of research projects, demonstration projects, technology transfer projects and other activities.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed above in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nThe FSTP calls should take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal.\nThe FSTP calls should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs\nThe consortium is expected to ensure that eligibility for financial support to third parties is extended to participants established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [5] .\nInclusiveness of a broad range of EU Member States and Associated Countries is expected, aiming at involving also partners coming from Eastern Europe who could enable solutions, thus strengthening their engagement in the SET Plan. Participation of public interest legal entities such as state, and notably regional and local authorities, which may have particular interest in regional development of renewable fuel value chains, is encouraged.\nImplementation of the action should profit from and capitalize the expertise in collaborating and networking of the relevant R&D programmes of national governments of the ERA-NET-Bioenergy network [6] on European research cooperation and coordination related to the field of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, as well as from the EU ERA-NET BESTF3 [7] .\nThe action is expected to have a duration of 5 years. It is expected that the action will organize joint transnational calls on an annual basis and will consider ample time for the implementation of the co-funded projects, notably before its end. Flexibility in defining activities for joint calls and implementing these calls adjusted to specific needs among beneficiaries is encouraged while FSTP must be defined in accordance with legal application requirements [8] . Appropriate monitoring and reporting of the results is expected.\nThe proposal should envisage to design and carry out coordination and clustering activities of the co-funded projects and also with other Horizon Europe projects of renewable fuels. These activities should also include synergies, communication (joint meetings), dissemination and exploitation and contribute to the Knowledge Community of the CETPartnership.\nHydrogen production as end-product and heat and power production are not in scope.\n[1] TRI 3: Enabling Climate Neutrality with Storage Technologies, Renewable Fuels and CCU/CCS | CET Partnership\n[2] Action 8 Implementation Plan (in future “Common Implementation Plan”)\n[3] In line with the amended Renewable Energy Directive\n[4] In line with the amended Renewable Energy Directive\n[5] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[6] https://international.fnr.de/project-funding/european-projects/era-net/era-net-bioenergy\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/691637\n[8] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/information-on-financial-support-to-third-parties_he_en.docx",

      "scope": "The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and innovation priorities [1] and targets [1] for ocean energy focussing on wave and tidal energy development. It will take into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on ocean energy (IWG ocean), the European Technology and Innovation Platform on ocean energy (ETIP Ocean) [3] and the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) joint programme on ocean energy [4] .\nThe overarching objective is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave and tidal energy systems that can survive in a harsh ocean or sea environment with minimal impacts on health and the environment and biodiversity. The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave and tidal energy development for different type of resources in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market. In this action the following can be considered:\n- The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative wave energy devices.\n- The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative next generation tidal energy devices\n- The development and demonstration of new sustainable materials in ocean energy converters, moorings and foundations whilst ensuring structural integrity, durability and circularity can be considered.\n- The development and demonstration of sustainable tailored mooring and connection of electrical or other power transmission systems (cable system, electrical equipment, ....) for wave and tidal energy devices. Advance combined mooring and electrical connectors or hydraulic power transmission to reduce component cost and number of connection operations, included in systems for sharing an anchor between devices in arrays. Develop novel systems for safe and quick connection/disconnection that do not require large vessels and/or diving teams.\n- The instrumentation for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of ocean energy devices and structures. Apply recent advances in condition and structural health monitoring from other sectors to ocean energy. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ocean energy technology development.\n- Advanced manufacturing of ocean energy devices and structures and auxiliary equipment considering reduced energy, manufacturing costs and materials consumption, high production throughput and optimization of logistics.\n- Development of technologies and solutions for the installation, maintenance and decommissioning of wave and tidal energy devices.\nThe validation and demonstration of new ocean energy technologies should be done in a controlled environment meaning that this is done under monitored and reproducible conditions, using for instance, test rigs and test tanks, semi-enclosed basins, or dedicated real-sea demonstration sites with instrumented monitoring infrastructure.\nStructure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation\nThe action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities implemented through financial support to third parties. The latter can include cooperation with the activities undertaken by the beneficiaries of the EU grant and may complement them. The R&I activities are divided into three challenges:\n- Breakthrough challenge\n- Validation challenge\n- Demonstration challenge\nThe breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities. The demonstration challenge will solely be implemented by the core consortium.\nThe breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the ocean energy sector and on the acceleration of ocean energy deployment at scale. The aim is that the innovative technologies have been at least validated towards the end of the project.\nThe validation challenge entail actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment which have been developed in the project or have been developed previously or separately in other European and national projects. FSTP can be used for new illustrative application use-cases demonstrating well defined added value to end users.\nIn the demonstration challenge the consortium is expected to carry out demonstration activities (up to TRL 7) in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan ocean energy R&I priorities and targets and accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry. The demonstration activities will be selected using the stage gate approach developed by the IEA OES task 12 [5] .\nActivities directly implemented by the core consortium\nThe activities of the core consortium are expected to include direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects).\nIt is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.\nThe project is expected to carry out at least three demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone for each demonstration activity before entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project has to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans compliant with the applicable standards, and iv) a complete business and implementation plan. The proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these, while demonstrating how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.\nThe total maximum amount of EU funding for the activities in the demonstration challenge is expected to be 24 million Euros.\nActivities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)\nA share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to engage research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.\nThe use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, and to respond to disruptive developments, attracting different stakeholders and innovators. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or a by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful projects initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&I work can continue without major interruption.\nFor the FSTP calls that are related to the breakthrough challenge and the validation challenge, the following considerations should be taken into account:\n- Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of demonstrating and upscaling wave and tidal energy considering the full supply chain. Up to 3 million EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The challenge should aim at attracting new partners (academia, SMEs, scale ups) and solutions.\n- Validation challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 6 million EUR EU funding is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.\nThe first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP call for the validation challenge should be published in a later stage of the project enabling the use of the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core R&I activities.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nFor the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [6]\nGovernance of the project\nThe action will require a strong internal governance and strong procedures. In the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges/actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). It will have to set out how and the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.\nThe core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.\nThe project must, for all the research and innovation activities, including the FSTP actions, embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress following the stage gate metrics developed by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring and share communicable results with the European R&D community. The evaluation framework has already been introduced by the Europewave PCP action.\nThe project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.\nThe consortium will have to present a comprehensive risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.\nBesides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the ocean energy sector. [7] These annual reviews will be defined as milestones of the project and, as such, they will be subject to the approval of the granting authority.\nThe project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in ocean energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Ocean Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership (CET Partnership) related initiative, and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advised the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET plan activities. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.\nThe consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D community.\nFor activities in line with relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programme on Ocean Energy Systems (IEA TCP OES) [8] , proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research infrastructures 110 , especially the Marinerg-i distributed infrastructure specialising in sea applications., as well as related projects offering access research infrastructures in the ocean energy applications, such as RISEnergy (https://risenergy-project.eu) [9] .\nDuration\nThe estimated project duration is around 5 years.\n[1] See for instance: Ocean Energy - European Commission and Homepage - Oceanset\n[2] See for instance: Ocean Energy - European Commission and Homepage - Oceanset\n[3] ETIP | Home\n[4] See for instance: https://www.etipocean.eu/knowledge_hub/1738/\n[5] OES | Performance Metrics\n[6] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[7] Ocean Energy - European Commission\n[8] OES | Ocean Energy Systems - an IEA Technology Collaboration Programme\n[9] https://risenergy-project.eu",

      "scope": "Renewable energy valleys are understood as decentralised renewable energy systems that offer a viable and efficient solution to the challenges mentioned above. For example, local production and consumption, reduced transmission and distribution losses thanks to the reliance on local networks for energy needs, greater operational flexibility and reduced dependence on expensive fuel imports all contribute to a higher energy autonomy, a more secure supply, and lower, more stable overall energy costs, including for individual citizens. In addition, this alleviates a part of the load on the centralised grid and avoids blockages by the capacity of the grid.\nThe action should cover either urbanised or rural contexts in Africa. It should contribute to providing sustainable renewable energy access and creating other socio-economic benefits, such as improved health, economic wealth, skills and jobs, while reducing the stress on the environment, notably on biodiversity, adopting a Water Energy Food Ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus approach and following methods of the circular economy [1] .\nActions are expected to cover the design, construct, commission and operate the demonstration installation, including aspects of energy needs and energy consumption, of grid stability and grid reinforcement in the region concerned. Actions should also develop and implement a tailored value chain approach, identifying the most suitable manufacturing value chains, on the basis of the local context, local material supply chain(s) and local workforce, with the objective of ensuring sustainable local economic development. A gender sensitive approach could further support the activities, taking into account relevant groups in a vulnerable situation such as rural communities, and women.\nAfrican SMEs are expected to play an important role in the overall value chain and to contribute in the identifying the needs. Participation of EU private sector actors should also be encouraged in alignment with the priorities of Global Gateway Strategy. Actions should also include the identification of technical, vocational and educational needs of the workforce and propose relevant training and qualification activities. Actions should finally define a market and business strategy that could take into consideration funding from European and international financial instruments and development finance programmes to ensure impact through a quick and viable commercial take-up of the technological solution demonstrated.\nSocial innovation should be considered. The business plan is expected to include appropriate consideration of available financial support instruments (local, regional and/or international) to enhance the speedy market deployment of the solution. The aspects of regulatory environment and local communities’ governance needs and/or impacts are also to be considered.\nProposals are expected to include a life cycle analysis showing the impact of the proposed solutions when compared to other technologies/solutions on the environment, on climate change targets and on the social and the economic dimensions, taking a cradle to grave viewpoint, encompassing the design and the operation phases. The life cycle analysis should take a cradle to grave approach. Proposals should adopt a circular economy approach. Whenever negative impacts have been identified, mitigations measures are expected.\nAs the demonstration installation will be located in Africa, relevant African partners have to participate in the implementation of the project. A balanced involvement in the activities of the projects of European and African partners will be considered an asset in the evaluation. Actions should also participate in and contribute to the African Union [2] - European Union collaborative research action on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy, in particular through cooperation/collaboration with the project LEAP-SE ( www.leap-re.eu ). Alignment with Global Gateway ongoing activities on renewable energy in Africa should be also prioritized, including the collaboration with EU Delegation and EU private sector actors in Africa, as well as with the Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA) and Cluster 6’s topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-02-two-stage.\nLesson learned from the implementation of European Renewable Energy Valleys projects should be considered. These projects are REFORMERS [3] and CRETE VALLEY [4] .\nProven access to necessary land and / or permits for operation at the time of application and / or convincing risk management regarding delayed availability of land or permits are expected in the proposal.\n[1] For an example of a methodology for the assessment of sustainability, circularity and contribution the EU resilience and technological autonomy of clean energy technology in the R&I pipeline, please see Study on circular approaches for a sustainable and affordable clean energy transition\n[2] “African Union member states” includes countries whose membership has been temporarily suspended.\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136211\n[4] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136139",

Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel technologies offer therefore the opportunity to innovative start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of innovative PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.",

      "scope": "The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7 million for Area A and 5 million for Area B. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.\nScope area A) Circular economy for Electric Vehicle (EV) powertrains and infrastructure :\nImproving the circularity of EVs drivetrain components (such as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, gear assemblies and battery components excluding battery cells) and respective charging infrastructure is crucial for resource efficiency, sustainability, and compliance with evolving European regulations. Through durable design, predictive maintenance, refurbishment, etc, it is possible to extend the lifespan of critical components reducing material demand and waste, without jeopardising on the needed performance. Advanced monitoring systems can predict failures, enabling proactive repairs, and to inform improved future design strategies, and potential second life applications. Automated processes coupled with design for dismantling can facilitate efficient component recovery, reducing labour costs and improving material separation for high-value recycling.\nThe projects are expected to build on the results of projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-04 , HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09 and HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-04 , as well as to consider the methodologies proposed. They are expected to target at least the same technical performance levels for the electric motor as HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09 under real-life working conditions, while optimising the design for circularity.\nProposals are expected to address all the following research activities:\n- Component health monitoring for individual components on their RUL (first and subsequent) including assessment of preferred circularity strategy and expected impact on EV affordability. This includes considering the impact of wear patterns, material fatigue, and thermal stress to optimise circularity strategies and extend the lifespan of components.\n- Develop novel design concepts and processes to optimise material usage and extend components’ lifetime such as design for (automated) dismantling, in particular to reduce dependency on critical raw materials or enable use of alternatives.\n- Promote broader Circular Economy (CE) adoption and increase the potential of reuse, repair and refurbishment by respective design criteria, means of standardisation (assessment and relevant interfaces), usage of RUL monitoring and better understanding of market potential.\n- Ensure economic and environmental sustainability in the analysis of drivetrain performance and charging infrastructure (e.g. efficiency, package, user driving experience, CRM use, CE).\nScope area B) Data-driven life-cycle management of Electric Vehicle (EV):\nVehicle specific data is crucial for advancing circularity through the 9R-strategies in EVs across their lifecycle. However, this data is often not available nor accessible after vehicle production, or not measured in the use phase. Digital passports and track and trace models can improve accessibility to data, enabling predictive maintenance, lifetime extension, and optimised recycling. Harmonised data-sharing policies are essential to ensure interoperability across value chains while maintaining data security and GDPR compliance. Data governance frameworks must regulate ownership, access, and consent to protect privacy and ensure responsible use. The common European data spaces initiative, notably the common European Green Deal data space, and the Data4Energy expert group [2] offer a foundation for secure, standardised architectures, ensuring trust and controlled data sharing. Furthermore, efficiency in data collection and storage is also critical. By integrating advanced data strategies, EV manufacturers can unlock new business opportunities and improve efficiency, while complying with regulations.\nProposals are expected to address all the following research activities:\n- Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for track & trace for representative EV components (e.g. as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, or thermal management of the battery system) ensuring access to, at least, the minimum needed data needed ensuring economic viable upscale and especially agreement on how this data can be accessed to enable/improve life-cycle management. The costs and benefits of tracing these data points should also be considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data and data management tools produced in the context of this topic are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n- Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for measuring real-world operational loads (mechanical, electrical, thermal) experienced by the representative EV components complemented by operational and environmental usage of EV that are key for life-cycle management and assessment (LCA).\n- Develop and demonstrate in real-life conditions API-based approach to data management of use phase and EoL and open interfaces that enable new business models, allow to better quantify circularity improvements, while allowing its sharing across value chains and supply chains, in a secure and privacy-compliant way.\n- Concepts and solutions for product passports based on the use of digital twins (e.g. identification of relevant data points, stakeholders, in connection with existing platforms/passports, such as the battery passport, and platforms e.g. IDIS, IMDS, and Catena-X [3] ) while also considering LCA aspects.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. The topic is open to both to Light Duty and Heavy-Duty electric vehicles.\n[1] Regulation - EU - 2024/1781 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] Digitalisation and data exchange are key enablers for a modern and resilient energy system - European Commission; https://ad4gd.eu/\n[3] IDIS | The International Dismantling Information System ; IMDS | International Material Data System ; Catena-X",

      "scope": "One of the key areas in the waterborne transport domain aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and subsequently reducing emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutants is the exploration, implementation, and assessment of renewable energy solutions and energy-saving measures. To this end, numerous advancements (e.g., electric and hybrid propulsion systems, wind-assisted propulsion technologies, hull optimization, air lubrication systems etc.) have been made across various aspects of ships. However, a high energy-efficient vessel requires addressing specific challenges despite the significant technological advancements. One of the most critical factors relates to the combination and integration of different solutions and measures that may lead to additional energy savings concerning multiple ship elements such as energy conversion, propulsion, onboard energy consumer demands (e.g., hotel loads for passenger vessels, operation equipment for offshore vessels etc.), higher-efficiency conventional or alternative power systems and others without compromising the ship’s safety and performance.\nAdaptability across different ship types and scalability, particularly for large vessels, are further challenges that require meticulous analysis. The shift towards zero emission entails significant investment costs, especially for small and medium-sized shipping companies, and consideration of financial viability is of paramount importance. Lastly, the absence of a concrete standardization framework poses a substantial barrier that must be adequately addressed and overcome.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Full-scale demonstration offering combined reduction of fuel consumption of at least 55% compared to 2008 levels. Proposals should clearly define the baseline, either in case of retrofits or newbuilds, with respect to the ship’s existing or expected operational profile.\n- Create a methodology estimating energy savings and reduced GHG intensity and emissions of air pollutants from each technology separately and the aggregated savings of combining these technologies in different scenarios.\n- Design optimization to facilitate deployment on different ship types, with a focus on retrofit cases and replication.\n- Capitalise on existing digital solutions for including energy optimization (e.g., smart control, energy management) and for seamless integration of technologies with the ship’s automation and class‑certification processes introducing and explore cyber security aspects of the developed solutions.\n- Projects should consider how high amounts of data transfers for monitoring, optimization, and decision-making may pose risks in terms of data integrity, cybersecurity and propose approaches to address those risks.\n- Assessment of environmental and wider benefits, including reduced emissions of air and water pollutants, and underwater noise, as well as cost-effectiveness of the combined solutions considering life-cycle assessment approaches.\n- Focus on safety and operational aspects addressing any technical and operational challenges that may arise from the combination of energy efficiency solutions.\n- Facilitate effective cooperation and joint training between vessel crews, ports, and shore-side emergency services to promote safety preparedness, coordinated response strategies, and best practices.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

      "scope": "The European Union aims to protect and conserve its marine and freshwater environments by achieving Good Environmental and Good Ecological Status [1] . The European Water Resilience Strategy and the European Ocean Pact further emphasize the need to enhance the resilience of European waters to human-induced pressures.

      "scope": "This topic aims to improve the suitability of fully-battery-electric operation of ferries, short sea shipping, offshore and inland vessels, considering the services they provide, their operation profiles and the possibilities to interact with charging infrastructure. Aspects like increasing the autonomy range of operation and fast charging are a crucial element for short sea shipping and inland routes with short docking periods. Fast charging may also put added strain on batteries in terms of output and durability. Optimization of the onboard electrical architecture and battery chemistry as well as optimized battery monitoring and management systems and more extensive training of crew can to some extent address this challenge. Life cycle aspects should be considered by design in the integration and operation of vessels, as well as the end-of-life of batteries, making sure that operations can be performed during the whole expected life of the vessel. The topic also explores the need to increase the power capability of fully electric vessels, aiming to define scenarios in which the increase of the peak propulsion power is needed to ensure the safety of operations. Proposals should cover the interface between vessels and port operations addressing the regulatory requirements, including operational procedures.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Full scale demonstration of innovative solutions for extended range and extended battery cycles beyond simple scaling up of existing commercial batteries. Solutions to increase the current operational range of electric vessels to at least 150 nm (or 277.8 KM for inland navigation) for short-sea shipping, ferries, offshore of 400-6500 GT vessels, or 86-135 meters for inland river vessels on free-flowing rivers upstream, allowing rapid in route charging and being applicable to representative operating conditions of the chosen ship. Demonstration of the vessel’s economic viability in normal operation. Demonstrations should also consider baseline reference which are already state of the art\n- Identifying the operational profiles and services that require higher energy output for safe and effective operation, developing solutions and modelling scenarios to ensure safe and efficient energy management and navigation taking into account the battery pack and recharging possibilities.\n- Incorporating energy-efficiency measures, including but not limited to, efficient AC-DC grid, thermal management, high voltage electrical components, energy management and energy modelling for optimal operation.\n- Implementation of vessel‑wide adaptive energy‑management solutions that coordinate battery, propulsion and hotel loads, maximising cycle life while minimising emissions.\n- Development of solutions for intelligent and optimized battery management to improve energy efficiency and life extension of the batteries. Furthermore, projects should consider life cycle aspects by design and address the end-of-life of batteries to ensure full electric operation during and beyond the planned operation of the vessel.\n- Creating concepts for rapid zero-emission in-route charging, fast charging, offshore charging or battery replenishment, including solutions capable of supplying power to idling vessels anchored offshore near ports, while maintaining desired operating schedules, adhering to current standards.\n- Encouraging modular design and ship retrofitting to facilitate replication of the solution, ideally presenting one full retrofit exercise and several replications in similar or different vessels, also including the needs of the OPS infrastructure.\n- Development of recommendations and best practices for the safety assessment of the novel installations based on field testing. This should build on established safety guidelines and requirements such as the Guidance on the Safety of Battery Energy Storage Systems onboard ships (from the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA) and the requirements for fixed and swappable batteries on inland vessels (from the European Committee For Drawing Up Standards In The Field Of Inland Navigation – CESNI), as applicable, and contribute to their applicability to a wider scope of novel electrification solutions. Furthermore, recommendations for improving the guidelines and extending them to the demonstrated new battery installation solutions should be presented. Regulatory aspects for the pertinent safety-critical ship systems as well as fire safety solutions for the battery room should also be addressed. In addition, the recommendations should also consider how integration of the safety considerations affects the overall operational planning and economic assessments.\n- The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business cases and provide roadmap for the replication and deployment of the proposed technology, including plans for scalability, commercialization, and deployment.

Airports operations can generate water pollution due to their extensive handling of jet fuel and de-icing chemicals, which, if not contained, can contaminate nearby water bodies. Similarly, attention must be given to other possible airport-related environmental impacts associated with noise, water quality, and local ecology in the vicinity of airports.\nIn order to address these issues, the following R&I actions should be undertaken:\n- Comprehensive real time and real-world measurements of pollutant (exhaust and non-exhaust, including resuspension of dust) and noise emissions. The sources of emissions should be differentiated, and the pollutants identified. Operations should include ground operations, landing and take-off (including emissions from tyres and brakes) and assessing exhaust emission during cruising, including impact of changes in flight altitude on engine performance parameters (stationary engine tests). The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated.\n- Pilot testing in 2 different airports (possibility as well for testing on other complex transport nodes) for proof of concept with the aim of increasing scalability and replicability for other similar environments. Proposals are expected to select specific airports that are in vicinity of urban/rural communities and close to water streams/bodies, to examine and quantify the effect of airport emissions on air quality, noise and water bodies.\n- Investigation of the adverse health and environmental effects (including biodiversity) of particle emissions, NOx, and non-regulated emissions (e.g. black carbon, tyre and brake particles, secondary organic aerosols, etc.) generated from aircraft and airport operations. The analysis should be supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis.\n- Estimates of the impact of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit) or GPUs (Ground Power Units) to stationary aircrafts’ emissions (GHG, air pollutants and noise) compared to conventional operation.\nProposals should consider the results from previously EU funded projects such as AVIATOR , nPETS , TUBE , ANIMA , NEEDED or any other similar projects.",

This includes the capability from online calculation of optimal countermeasures to ensure safety, and reduce any negative impacts on all road users, by considering available infrastructure (including also automated and connected digital components, like sensors, intelligent traffic control systems, cooperative communication), and overall conditions. Such an architecture also needs to address relevant requirements, particularly in technology and near and far communications, outlining the technical standards and investments necessary for risk mitigation. These may include solutions to increase road users’ situational awareness and the provision of reliable, accurate and timely warnings.\n- Establishment of working methods and harmonization of interfaces with national/local road authorities, operators and emergency services (e.g. first responders in case of accidents), including remote operations and road enforcement. The aim must be the creation or adaption of decision-support tools that can be integrated with mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services. This also includes the definition of related shared governance models. Understanding of the requirements for public road authorities (national and local) to address CCAM critical cases, defining their role in supporting and enabling CCAM operations.\n- Enhanced user acceptance through holistic CCAM solutions addressing their individual needs and requirements as e.g. road user, customer, operator, service provider, etc., in terms of trust, safety, security, etc.",
      "scope": "Based on the preliminary and final findings of HEADSTART [1] , SUNRISE [2] , EVENTS [3] , ROADVIEW [4] and SYNERGIES [5] (among others), this call is focussing on CCAM solutions for critical cases, specifically situations and events that are less regular and of higher risk. These cases may also include emergency conditions and unplanned events, on local and on larger (regional, national, European) scale, such as extreme weather conditions, road incidents, cyberattacks, traffic disruptions, and sudden loss of coverage of the Operational Design Domain (ODD).\nCCAM operations may be disturbed under multiple scenarios, and can vary according to the type of road, road attributes, traffic conditions, available infrastructure and technology, malfunctions, incidents, etc. Depending on the specific circumstances and the dimension of the disturbance, the impact on CCAM operations and involved agents (e.g. road users, vehicles, VRUs, infrastructure components, emergency services, operators) may vary. According to the case and the dimension of the incident, different entities and actors of the CCAM system (and even beyond, e.g. regulatory bodies and emergency and crisis response centres) are involved and may need to take part to resolve these events in a resilient, safe and secure way.\nThis call adopts a holistic approach, investigating critical cases not only from technological/infrastructure or vehicle-related perspectives (e.g., edge cases for automated vehicles) but also from the viewpoint of the user, customer, service provider, authority, city, etc. In particular, the focus is on how the CCAM system addresses and mitigates potential negative consequences of such events, including safety risks, emissions, loss of trust, and similar impacts. Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Development of a clustered list of critical scenarios, impacted entities, role and relation of all stakeholders, the estimated impact and the optimal kind of CCAM-based countermeasure.\n- Development and testing of tools and services for the detection of critical situations and edge cases, also based on the tools and approaches for robust environment perception done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02.\n- Development and testing of CCAM-based countermeasure solutions. Where applicable, the use of artificial intelligence methods and digital infrastructure support should be considered, aligned also to the tools and approaches for robust decision making done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02. The solutions also should reference common EU Emergency Response Protocols, e.g. for first responders. Also, the creation of decision-support tools and the integration of those into mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services must be considered. In general, customer/user understanding and trust in the CCAM system is crucial in the adoption of a new service. In building trust, it is vital to take into consideration the user perspective and investigate how critical cases can be managed in a way that is effective for the improvement of customer perception.\n- Validation and evaluation of solutions in terms of resulting risk reduction and potential negative impacts of critical cases. Solutions will need to be targeted against the scenarios identified and the stakeholders affected and would aim to either eliminate the risk to the service resilience or reduce its likelihood and impact as far as reasonably practicable. This also includes the quantification of the impact, which may also be deduced by using simulation. In addition, also the integration of the solutions into existing platforms needs to be validated in relevant environments (TRL 5). The outcomes of this call are expected to feed into future CCAM demonstrations.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProjects funded under this topic are expected to build on the insights and outcomes of the CCAM Technology Observatory, exploring and leveraging complementarities between their own activities and the Observatory’s findings.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

      "scope": "Several coordination and stakeholder concertation tools have been established to support the alignment and international outreach of CCAM projects. The FAME project developed a European framework for CCAM testing, evaluation and data sharing and managed the EU-wide Knowledge Base that consolidates information related to CCAM R&I and testing based on results from European and national projects, aiding researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals The platform will be extended in the project funded under the call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05 [2] to address public authorities and citizens.\nRegular events such as the European Conference on Connected and Automated Driving (EUCAD) and EUCAD symposia, international outreach activities and interactions with the Member States Advisory Group (SRG), extend the work of the CCAM Partnership and facilitate and support international dialogues to exchange knowledge and align activities across Europe and globally, at research and regulatory level.\nThe purpose of this exchange and alignment is to address and overcome barriers to the deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV) in Europe. Since 2022, Europe has introduced several regulatory developments aimed at facilitating the rollout of highly automated vehicles. The Implementing Act for Automated Driving Systems 2022/1426, the amendment to the Delegated Regulation 2022/2236 on type-approval, as well as the UNECE WP.29 Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) have all proposed frameworks and methods to ensure the safety of CCAM systems on the road. Despite these advances, a major challenge persists: the fragmented regulatory landscape for CCAM in Europe, which continues to hinder large-scale deployment. The FAME [3] and Hi-Drive [4] projects are working on recommendations for a harmonized open road-testing framework. Projects like HEADSTART [5] , SUNRISE [6] , and SYNERGIES are operationalizing the UNECE New Assessment/Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM) scenario-based approach. The project funded by call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02 [7] will extend the safety assurance framework (SAF) with ‘In-Service Monitoring and Reporting’ post-deployment. Coordination mechanisms are essential as Member States update regulations to align perspectives and support common approval procedures.\nProposed actions are expected to address the following aspects:\n- Extend the EU Knowledge Base with practical tools that support safe deployment, not only supporting researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals, but also addressing public authorities and citizens, to establish and prepare the implementation of a long-term sustainability plan for structure.\n- Accelerate the exchange and cooperation between relevant European and international stakeholders, including Member States and Associated Countries, with the purpose to accelerate deployment. This by means of co-organizing high-level events such as the EUCAD conference and to coordinate with a large-scale cooperation (such as an IPCEI).\n- Develop and implement practical safety assessment procedures, as well as a framework for the secure exchange of applications for open road-testing permits across European Member States, with acknowledgement for specific MS regulations and context.\n- Support the realization of EU-wide federated scenario databases, with European in-depth accident databases.\nThe project funded under this topic is expected to continue the management and hosting of the CCAM Technology Observatory, including its database and content.\n[1] https://synergies-ccam.eu/\n[2] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069898\n[4] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006664\n[5] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824309\n[6] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069573\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203230",

Development of options for behavioural change towards healthier, safer and more sustainable mobility and lifestyles in rural and urban populations in a vulnerable situation.",
      "scope": "EU policies, such as the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the European Green Deal, emphasise the need for inclusive, efficient, accessible and sustainable transport systems that leave no one behind. Transport poverty refers to individuals’ and households’ inability or difficulty to meet the costs of private or public transport, or their lack of or limited access to transport needed for their access to essential socioeconomic services and activities. Considering the national and spatial context, transport poverty affects both rural and underserved urban areas. Addressing this challenge requires innovative multimodal transport solutions which integrate various modes efficiently, leveraging digitalisation, shared mobility, and demand-responsive transport to enhance affordability, reliability, and accessibility, thereby ensuring Mobility as a Right.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Building on the outcome of previous calls and existing knowledge (e.g. SMARTA-NET [1] , the study on Novel policy ideas for a shift to low-carbon mobility [2] , the study on Transport poverty: definitions, indicators, determinants, and mitigation strategies [3] and other relevant EU-funded projects [4] ), and drawing on the feedback experience of existing innovative mobility solutions (e.g. SMARTA-NET Catalogue of rural shared mobility solutions [5] ), investigate strategies to enhance availability and accessibility of sustainable and inclusive transport services in sparsely populated regions with limited transport options.\n- Analyse the demand for mobility services in regions and communities affected by transport poverty and investigate which drivers could facilitate transport users in a vulnerable situation (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport) to use public transport or other shared mobility options (including e.g. underutilised regional and secondary rail lines or feeder services to main rail corridors).\n- Develop new sustainable and inclusive integrated multimodal solutions that ensure seamless transitions between rural and urban transport modes, improving first- and last-mile connectivity. Solutions should focus on vulnerable and low-income households (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport), and should combine, in an optimal (economic, social, environmental, and operational) way, the various modal transport offers to go beyond forced car ownership. Developing new digital platforms is out of the scope of this topic.\n- Each proposal must include pilot demonstrations in at least 4 pilot sites. The pilot demonstrations must cover 4 different areas across the EU and Associated Countries ensuring geographical balance and diversity of issues addressed (e.g. presence or not of transport services such as regional trains, frequency of services, population density). Each proposed issue must be addressed in at least two pilots. The pilots must be community-driven, carried out under the lead or with the involvement of rural/local/regional public authorities/administrations and the local transport authorities, and these entities must be included in the consortium as beneficiaries.\n- Elaborate and propose plans for a possible implementation of the developed and tested solutions by local authorities and transport authorities/operators.\n- Through the active engagement of public transport operators, local authorities, rural communities, and civil society organisations, through the European Rural Mobility Network (ERMN) [6] , elaborate a roadmap to implement and scaling up the tested solutions, while ensuring widespread adoption across diverse regional contexts.\nProposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative [7] through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan.\nIf the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot :\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable designing inclusive transport systems that consider accessibility, equity, and digital literacy. Proposals should consider citizens engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and support.\n[1] https://www.smarta-net.eu/\n[2] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ae58bebf-b2b9-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1\n[3] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b300f5f-b125-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[4] Various shared mobility solutions have been demonstrated in multiple European projects, including , SMARTA2 , LAST MILE , MAMBA , INCLUSION , MARA , MELINDA , Hi-Reach , UPPER and SPINE .\n[5] Solutions – SMARTA-NET\n[6] ERMN – SMARTA-NET\n[7] CIVITAS",

      "scope": "Today’s Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services are primarily provided through Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) that tend to have weak signals and are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing.\nThis topic addresses alternative PNT methods that are essential to provide fallback options in case of GNSS signal loss or degradation. Great benefit is expected through integration of PNT technology with rapidly emerging technologies, such as 5G/6G and Internet of Things (IoT). The aim is to investigate innovative solutions for PNT – including the impact on the regulatory framework, integrating advanced 5G technologies and IoT to act as complementary, redundant, secure and resilient navigation solutions for aviation, including UAS, in challenging environments.\nThe topic also addresses e-conspicuity, aiming to enhance pilot awareness notably at lower altitudes in U-space airspace in order to reduces collision risk in general aviation, where most small aircraft rely on see-and-avoid. Mobile telephony, with minimum network performance requirements, can provide a safe, affordable communication solution for U-space entry and flight safety.",

Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel tandem technologies offer therefore the opportunity for innovative spin-offs or start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain and thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of tandem PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

The intention is to integrate also storage into such (hybrid) PV systems offering flexibility. It is consequently essential to build a blueprint for the implementation of high voltage large PV systems and the development of Direct Current (DC) networks around strategic end users for high voltage demand (industrial sites, servers, electric vehicle charging stations…). Understanding the factors that influence the performance and economics of these system architectures will help system planners evaluate the potential benefits of such hybrid resources that could support an increasing future industrial electrification. Another crucial challenge to address in ensuring the continued growth of new investments in solar PV, is the increasing occurrence of zero or negative prices in the electricity market, which dramatically hurt the profitability of operating solar PV assets. To tackle this challenge, PV participation to ancillary services is a way forward, which would reduce significantly system operating costs and PV curtailment and improve system reliability and PV profitability. The coupling/pooling with other generation assets or storage/demand assets is also to be considered.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes as indicated for the proposed scope (high voltage DC PV systems or PV participation in electricity markets):\nScope 1: High-voltage DC PV systems:\n- Highly efficient PV systems, optimal utilisation of generated PV electricity, energy savings;\n- Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and affordable electricity for industrial users.\nScope 2: PV participation in electricity markets:\n- Increased social profitability of PV by participation to ancillary services;\n- Energy efficient, cost competitive and flexible contribution of PV systems to the energy markets.\nAll proposals are expected to support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

Projects are expected to be the basis and orientation for future full-size projects. To maximise the impact, projects should have a substantial industrial involvement.\nProjects should address most, but not necessarily all of the below issues:\n- Detailed planning and preparation for retrofitting capture systems to existing industrial plants;\n- Demonstrating important system components;\n- Identification and characterisation of the clustering potential of (cross-border) regional CO2 emitters;\n- Optimisation of industrial symbiosis between emitters and potential users of CO2;\n- Development of tools to optimise the design and operation of the cluster(s) and operate CO2 streams with different compositions, flow rates and operating regimes to comply with the constraints for the shared transport and storage infrastructure;\n- Identification of potential regional users of a common CO 2 infrastructure (this could also include enlargement counties, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova);\n- Comprehensive economic and technical assessment to identify the best (multimodal) transport options, including the re-use of existing infrastructure;\n- Development of business models for regional CO2 transport networks, including for dispersed industrial sites to link these to larger industrial clusters or pipeline networks;\n- Consideration of feasible CO2 geological storage services\n- Comprehensive set of studies and preparatory actions leading to permitting;\n- Scenarios for integrating CO2 infrastructure in (plans for) regional, national and/or cross-border energy networks (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas), also in relation to future changes in industrial landscape and energy supply mix.\nProjects are expected to deliver a strategy for the exploitation of results that includes plans for scalability, commercialisation, deployment, permitting procedures, and identified public and private funding sources for CAPEX and OPEX, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the Regional Development policy funds.\nFor CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and (in particular onshore) geological storage, public acceptability is paramount. Therefore, projects are expected to identify and engage relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) in deliberative activities, so as to consider and respond to their needs and concerns.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of R&I activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.",

      "scope": "Insects play a vital role contributing to ecosystem functions in addition to pollination, such as decomposition and nutrient cycles, soil formation (including carbon sequestration) and pest control, control functions essential for maintaining ecosystem complexity, and are an indispensable part of the food chain. Those functions are key for climate change mitigation and allow the provision of ecosystem services which have economic benefits and support human well-being. Additionally, insects play a key role in other socioeconomic areas such as medical and pharmaceutical applications (e.g. antimicrobial peptides), forensic science or biotechnology.\nThe dramatic decline of insects, estimated around 75% in the last three decades, is raising increasing concern among scientists and in the public, since it could have far-reaching implications. In order to be able to tackle this decline, there is a need to improve our understanding of the drivers of loss and how they interplay. A better knowledge of insects themselves is necessary.\nWith targets 4 and 5 of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU took, among others, the commitment that by 2030 habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend, and that the decline of pollinators is reversed. According to the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, Member States shall put in place appropriate and effective measures to improve pollinator diversity and reverse the decline of pollinators by 2030. This is reflected in target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in which they should promote Nature-based Solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation. These policies and legislations have reached the implementation stage in the EU and worldwide.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n- improve understanding and identification of insects’ diversity, including through genomic approaches;\n- focus on less known insect groups. In particular a solid knowledge has already been generated regarding pollination and pollinating insects through past and ongoing projects, therefore they are not expected to be subject to new research under this topic;\n- assess the status and trends of insects and analyse multiple drivers affecting them, as well as the ecosystem services that insects provide, at different spatial scales. A comprehensive integrative taxonomy approach should be adopted, incorporating a multidisciplinary framework, including ecology and ecotoxicology, and integrating methods that address the diverse needs of insects across their entire lifecycle, ensuring the identification of essential habitat resources at each stage of development. To assess the status and trends of insects and the effectiveness of strategies, proposals should develop and test approaches for long-term monitoring schemes for insects, possibly building on existing national or EU biodiversity monitoring schemes and pilots developed by Biodiversa+;\n- devise, test and promote effective strategies to mitigate the major drivers of insects’ decline. Analyse the ecosystem functions underpinned by insects and undertake qualitative and quantitative valuation of ecosystem services emanating from those functions;\n- explore how to implement ecosystem protection and restoration practises and actions that are beneficial for insects.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, EMBRC, eLTER and MIRRI-ERIC [1] to store and give access to research data could be considered where relevant.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service and with other projects that work on understanding drivers of biodiversity decline.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] And any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).

      "scope": "The European Environment Agency (EEA)’s report on Europe's state of water (2024) [2] highlighted that 77% of groundwater, which supplies two thirds of the EU's drinking water, is in good chemical status. For groundwater not reaching good chemical status, the report identified nitrates, pesticides and pharmaceuticals among main issues. However, less is known about contaminants of emerging concern, such as perfluorinated substances (e.g. PFAS), microplastics and antimicrobial resistance. The Commission proposal [3] to revise the lists of surface- and groundwater pollutants and their standards in the Water Framework Directive, in the Groundwater Directive and in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive aims to address these concerns. Although freshwater standards can serve as a benchmark, standards that are protective for freshwater ecosystems may not be sufficiently protective for groundwater ecosystems. [4] Much stronger evidence on presence, functions and sensitivity of groundwater ecosystems is required for a reliable hazard assessment.\nSignificant knowledge gaps exist regarding groundwater ecosystems and their biodiversity in Europe, making it challenging to establish their effective protection. Proposals should address such gaps, which would ultimately lead to better protection of our precious drinking water resources, as well as groundwater biodiversity and geodiversity, but also groundwater (aquatic and terrestrial)-dependent ecosystems and biodiversity.\nMore specifically proposals under this topic should include all of the following activities:\n- improve and develop innovative methods, including by utilising sensors (e.g. biosensors, remote sensors), for assessing and characterising groundwater ecosystems and their sensitivity, and identifying the presence and functions of different taxonomic groups and organisms;\n- establish harmonised, validated, and ultimately standardised, methods and generate reliable experimental data on acute and chronic effects for assessing ecotoxicity of pollutants as regards groundwater ecosystems and in particular sensitive/ vulnerable ecosystems, with the aim to prioritize substances and deriving groundwater standards to protect them;\n- identify a suite of biological and physico-chemical quality elements in view of a possible future assessment and classification of groundwater ecological status for inclusion in EU water legislation. This should include developing criteria and targets related to the temporary or long-term impacts on groundwater ecosystems.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing EU-funded projects and initiatives, for example projects funded by the co-funded partnership “Water4All”, with focus on groundwaters, to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid duplication.\nProposals are encouraged to combine inter-disciplinary expertise and integrate perspectives from different governance levels.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, eLTER and MIRRI-ERIC (and any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) [5] ) to store and give access to research data could be considered where relevant.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. The research actions are expected to yield valuable new insights and data, supporting and informing future assessments by IPBES.\nThe JRC can provide estimates of groundwater recharge and contribution of groundwater to streamflow, based on continental scale hydrological modelling, and consider testing the methods developed in the project, for the purposes of continental scale assessment of groundwater-dependent ecosystems.\nInternational cooperation with Mediterranean countries is encouraged.\n[1] Groundwater ecosystems, in a broad sense, encompass systems formed by organisms inhabiting water-filled spaces in the subsurface, including sediments and rocks, the hyporheic zone beneath rivers, the interfaces at springs and lakes, and the zone from the groundwater table surface down to the deepest habitable conditions, such as cave waters. These ecosystems are open systems that maintain direct connections with other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n[2] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/europes-state-of-water-2024\n[3] https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-amending-water-directives_en\n[4] See for example EMA (European Medicines Agency, 2018).

      "scope": "The deep sea represents 90% of the Ocean volume and remains the least explored biome of the planet. Nevertheless, we know that the deep sea forms an extensive and complex ensemble of ecosystems which functioning is crucial to the rest of the biosphere, global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems upon which much terrestrial life, including human civilisation, depends. The critical limiting factors in the definition and implementation of protection and restoration measures are the lack of biodiversity knowledge and appropriate monitoring, especially in layers below 1000 m. The main reasons are the limited access and high cost of explorations of the diversity of biotopes in the deep sea, and the resources available to identify organisms across the full range of sizes (from microorganisms to megafauna) and describe ecosystems functioning.\nIn line with the objectives and targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU climate adaptation strategy, the strategy for European life sciences, the European Ocean Pact, the Treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), proposals should:\n- fill the gaps in geographical coverage in habitats mapping, species inventory, genetic diversity, ecological functioning, food webs and ecological connectivity (including migratory species) of deep sea ecosystems in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones (abyssal seafloor, hydrothermal sites, seamounts, canyons and across the water column) between them and with shallower ocean zones (mesopelagic, epipelagic, coastal...);\n- develop, integrate and deploy imaging, acoustic, multi-omics, genomics and taxonomic technologies and methodologies for the inventory and fast identification of deep-sea marine species from microbes, invertebrates to migratory species, apex predators such as sharks and mammals, corals and other habitat-forming species, generating reference datasets from identified voucher specimens and novel methods to improve biodiversity monitoring and inventory and the discovery of novel biological traits, enhancing understanding of ecosystem resilience to climate and anthropogenic pressures;\n- contribute to the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and to free and open access to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s biodiversity data;\n- establish baselines, spatial and temporal dynamics, assess and predict the cumulated impacts from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors including underwater noise, on ecosystems functioning and services, including the biological carbon pump fisheries stock;\n- describe holistic interactions between the deep sea, Ocean and planetary health and propose actionable knowledge by involving multiple stakeholders for identifying adaptive management approaches, and mitigation and conservation scenarios for prioritised deep sea areas to reduce impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on ecosystem structure and functioning;\n- identify the indicators and thresholds, such as Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) and propose cost-effective observation approaches and the data integration, for the long-term monitoring and the modelling of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems functioning, covering oxygen concentration, carbon fluxes, nutrients and biogeochemistry, to inform management on impacts and conservation or mitigation measures.\nProposals should foresee dedicated tasks and resources for cooperating with projects funded under this topic as well as with other relevant international, Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 projects on marine biodiversity, functional ecology and on observation, mapping, monitoring and modelling.

      "scope": "Protected areas are key to ensure the conservation of species and habitats. However, the intensification of the main drivers of biodiversity loss is raising questions on how their effectiveness will be maintained in the future.\nThis topic is expected to support the EU commitment to legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s land area and a minimum of 30% of the EU’s sea area of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (target 1) and the related legislation, and the corresponding target of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (target 3). Knowledge generated under this topic is also expected to inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy after 2030 and the design and implementation of climate policies. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate provide recommendations to policy makers.\nProposals should:\n- analyse trends over time of the effects of drivers of biodiversity loss and their possible cumulative impacts. Direct drivers (changing use of sea and land, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species) and indirect drivers should be considered, including socio-economic related ones;\n- develop predictive tools to anticipate how the intensity of impacts will develop in the medium and long terms, taking into account relevant possible cumulative impacts;\n- assess expected future impacts on the conservation status of protected habitats and species in protected areas;\n- assess whether novel adaptive approaches for protection are needed and if so, explore options, possibly building on results of relevant LIFE projects and on the experience of climate refugia (areas where ecosystems sustain stability and resilience despite climate change) and of bright spots (where targeted conservation actions, climate adaptation strategies, or natural resilience mechanisms mitigate biodiversity loss). Assess the opportunity to rely on (new) practices such as assisted migration;\n- define best practices and test innovative management approaches of protected areas, with performance indicators. To assess the effectiveness of management approaches, projects should build on methods and indicators developed under LIFE PAME Europe [1] . Proposals should address various types of protected areas and assess how the results might be transposable;\n- consider the need for long-term ecological monitoring of protected habitats and species, provide recommendations and consider possible options for such long-term monitoring;\n- involve public authorities and/or entities which manage protected areas, and civil society organisations to ensure that the processes and outcomes of the R&I align with the needs, including for policy implementation, and values and expectations of society.\nProposals should address research field A: terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems or research field B: marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Both research fields may include freshwater ecosystems. The research field (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service, and ensure cooperation with the European partnership Biodiversa+.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] in the environment domain.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged especially when protected areas expand over different countries and for exchange of experiences.\n[1] LIFE PAME EUROPE - EUROPARC Federation\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

      "scope": "To address the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), as well as Sustainable Development Goals, actions funded under this topic should support the scientific development of A) integrated scenarios, B) predictive models and C) model intercomparison experiments for Member States and Associated Countries. Developments should be verified in case studies covering at least 2 European biogeographic regions [1] and spanning key economic sectors to inform systemic policy transformations and enable long-term planning for a nature positive society. Proposals should:\n- design and develop components of a European integrated prediction and scenario framework to forecast how natural ecosystems respond to a wide range of human-induced ecosystem interactions including climate change, pollution, socio-economic transitions such as conflicts, pressures, and policy interventions. These frameworks should link ecosystem functions with key economic sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, and test their resilience and tipping points under multiple plausible futures;\n- make use of long-term monitoring data across biodiversity, land use, climate, and socio-economic variables to improve reliability and real-world relevance. They should also quantify uncertainty in model projections and ensure scenarios incorporate dynamic feedback loops between ecosystems and socio-economic systems, and identify risk distributions relevant to frontline socio-ecological communities;\n- test and assess the suitability of the IPBES Nature Futures Framework for European application and align modelling approaches with international efforts and assessments under IPBES and IPCC. Proposals should seek to address knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate provide recommendations to policymakers;\n- advance model intercomparison capabilities to improve robustness, consistency and transparency in scenario-based assessments. To this end, the suitability of remote sensing data for scalability and intercomparison between different models and across different regions should be assessed.\nProposals should include case studies that cover at least two European biogeographic regions with global relevance to verify the developed scenarios, models and intercomparison experiments. Case studies should consider different geographical scales and explore ecosystem tele coupling across Europe and beyond. Scenario development should involve relevant stakeholders—including public authorities, economic sectors, and civil society—in co-creating narratives and ensuring policy applicability. Socio-economic transitions and equity and justice considerations concerning trade-offs and distributional impacts across regions and communities (i.e. across biodiversity, climate, food, water, air, health, energy and the economy) should be explicitly addressed in scenario assessments. Proposals are encouraged to address livelihood and distributional impacts linked to each nature-positive pathway. Proposals are encouraged to broadly and publicly communicate developed scenarios through interactive simulation interfaces (i.e. at the example of EN-ROADS [2] ).\nProposals should create synergies with and build on existing knowledge and results of other relevant EU-funded projects. Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures. This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science (ESSI). Successful proposals are expected to cooperate with projects that will be selected under ESA's FutureEO programme. To this end, proposals should foresee sufficient means and resources for effective coordination.\n[1] Biogeographical regions in Europe | European Environment Agency's home page\n[2] https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/",

      "scope": "Genetic erosion poses a significant threat to agricultural resilience, as genetic diversity is crucial for crops to withstand environmental stresses such as climate variations, pests, and diseases. As the global population grows, the demand for increased food production often drives large-scale agriculture, which compromises biodiversity and long-term productivity. While promoting and expanding agrobiodiversity enhances agricultural resilience, socio-economic obstacles hinder broader adoption. Beyond highlighting the importance of conserving agricultural biodiversity for food security, it is essential to demonstrate its role in enhancing food production, increasing farmers' incomes, and safeguarding livelihoods against environmental challenges. A significant obstacle to a wider adoption of more diversified production systems, is perceived risk in that process, in terms of yield, (marginal) income, lack of demand, stable and sufficient pricing, and potential increase of pests.\nProposals should:\n- quantify the contribution of agrobiodiversity (including soil microorganisms), mainly at parcel/farm level, considering both species abundance and composition, and its economic impact, in particular in regard to food security, such as yield stability, nutritional quality, nutrient cycling and resilience to pests and diseases;\n- develop solutions and strategies to scale successful agrobiodiversity practices tailored to local, regional and national levels to strengthen farmers’ financial position in adopting more diversified production systems;\n- test how instruments for mobilising private finance, such as nature credits, could enhance the competitiveness of farmers, foresters and other land managers, including by opening up new opportunities of income;\n- build on and develop a decision support tool analysing the risk of diversifying production systems, in terms of yield, marketability, pricing, pests and diseases, hazard assessment of adverse organisms, genes and chemicals, and more, to assist farmers, breeders and agribusinesses in farm diversification;\n- provide recommendation for farmers, breeders, agricultural organizations, and agribusinesses for risk mitigation in adoption of wider varieties and marketability of non-conventional crops and local breeds produced in lower volumes ;\n- define and evaluate the costs of farm diversification, in terms of labour and management complexity, and explore how these may be offset via lower costs of external inputs. Identify behavioural determinants in different socio-economic and cultural contexts to adoption of biodiversity friendly practices;\n- explore pathways for the valorisation of products, including tailored food processing and storage, relevant risk assessments for new methods/varieties, and strengthened collaboration with food industries.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the Nature Credits Roadmap [2] , and the EU Nature Restoration Regulation.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding to assess the inclusion of quantified data in the EU Food System Monitoring Dashboard, and farm sector resilience analysis. Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nProposals must adopt a multi-actor approach, engaging diverse stakeholders, particularly farmers and land managers, to integrate sector-specific knowledge and needs. This ensures impactful outcomes that address conservation and habitat requirements while aligning with agricultural contexts.\nProposals should build (when relevant) upon existing knowledge and solutions designed and previously developed from previous projects demonstrating positive outcomes of enhancing agrobiodiversity for sustainable agriculture, funded by EU and national programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), and the LIFE programme. Proposals should plan cooperation with the Agroecology Partnership and the Mission Soil.\nDue to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, including with China under the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biosolutions (FAB) flagship initiative. Development of specific technologies above TRL 4 is out of the scope of this topic.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex",

Textiles are the fourth highest-pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water and fifth for GHG emissions and a major source of microplastic pollution in production and use phases. They are also a key material and product stream in the circular economy action plan. Proposals are expected to demonstrate and deploy innovative solutions for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary textile materials and their processing and treatments.\nProposals should:\n- address textile consumer products made of fibre blends (e.g. polycotton, or other blends of multiple materials in combination such as synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural);\n- demonstrate and test novel and marketable solutions for post-consumer textile waste (apparel and home textiles) enabling its effective end-of-life collection, sorting and recycling (fibre-to-fibre), possibly including biotech solutions;\n- demonstrate and test innovative techniques for effectively disassembling complex products, separating multi-material layers and fibre blends and removal of non-textile components, coatings or contaminants to facilitate efficient recycling processes;\n- assess the recyclability limits of textiles by determining the number of recycling cycles a fibre can undergo. When further fibre-to-fibre recycling is no longer viable, alternative applications should be explored to extend the material's value. Solutions should address recycling of products made of natural fibres (e.g., cotton) or/and semi-synthetic fibres, i.e. modified natural fibres (e.g. viscose), blended with synthetic fibres, ensuring optimal resource efficiency and minimizing waste throughout the textile lifecycle;\n- characterize post-consumer textile waste in order to define appropriate management practices in particular if the technology is developed within an industrial and urban symbiosis;\n- advance recycling technologies that remove persistent chemicals (e.g. PFAS) from post-consumer textile waste which may harm human health and the environment, and that minimise the release of hazardous chemicals and microplastics during the recycling process.\nA lifecycle perspective using LCA and LCC should be used when validating the technical and economic feasibility of the developed, improved, demonstrated and up-scaled processes. For comparability reasons, LCAs should use well-established methods and be based on PEF wherever feasible. Proposals should fully incorporate the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) approach.\nProposals are expected to contribute to the objectives of the Textiles of the Future partnership and to build on/coordinate with EU projects funded under the partnership and previous textile-related Horizon Europe calls.

      "scope": "There is a need to better understand the production and use of biomass, a limited resource, in its various types. Bioeconomy, and biomass as its essential feedstock, provides solutions on various dimensions (environmental, social and economic). However, there are biomass-related challenges to overcome: the EU forest carbon sink is below the target and declining in most countries and the need to restore ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss [1] . This implies that biomass supply is partly unsustainable. Simultaneously, companies see themselves challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are solutions to increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the demand: e.g. better valorise unused or under-exploited sustainable biomass and degraded land, apply new breeding techniques and increase resource efficiency through circular design, new business models, consumption, recycling or repair.\nThere is a need to better understand where biomass valorisation can be improved, to ensure local or regional added value increases and to drive innovative and competitive business solutions. For an optimal biomass production and effective use, matching supply and demand in the local or regional context, a better and more robust understanding of actual biomass flows is a fundamental prerequisite.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n- Improve and develop innovative, administration-light biomass monitoring and modelling/assessment methods and digital tools at European level (regional, national, and continental scale) to optimise biomass flows, paying particular attention to areas with untapped (sustainable) biomass resources, in close cooperation with stakeholders.\n- Provide an updated estimate of biomass supply and demand today and projected until 2050 at national and EU level, including associated countries, considering the quality of biomass, their potential use, the sustainability and risks (e.g. spread of pathogens) of supplied biomass, as well as potential non-satisfied (non-)industrial demand due to the limitation of availability of sustainable biomass. The 2050 outlook should be accompanied by scenarios on EU’s future bioresources regarding supply and demand.\n- Test and demonstrate, in cooperation with stakeholders, the feasibility of biomass reporting in test regions of at least 10 countries across Europe with different potential of biomass supply.\nThe European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding since the monitoring and assessment tools developed may contribute to the EU level assessment of biomass flows of the Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy.\nProposals are encouraged to work together with additional relevant initiatives including those of the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, the BIOEAST Initiative; build on results from projects such as BIO2REG, CONCERTO, NextGenCarbon; as well as considering the topic ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-08: Improving biomass flows for a sustainable and circular bioeconomy’.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by the European research infrastructure in the environment, biological and food domains.\nThe topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the European Commission’s communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU; the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal; the Vision for Agriculture and Food; the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act and the Circular Economy Act.\n[1] EEA The European Biomass Puzzle | European Environment Agency's home page / EC LULUCF report / EC JRC The JRC Biomass Mandate | Knowledge for policy .",

      "scope": "As the bioeconomy and nature markets gain importance, enabling diversification of value streams for farmers, policymakers must ensure that the growing use of agricultural biomass and agricultural land for non-food purposes (e.g., for the development of novel bio-based chemicals, compounds, materials, products and services, energy production, environmental services provision, carbon and biodiversity credits) does not compromise food security. For the purpose of this topic, nature markets encompass market mechanisms (e.g., nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] , carbon credits, market-based payments for environmental services) mobilising private finance to create income streams for primary producers in return for undertaking actions supporting well-functioning ecosystem services (e.g., water quality and availability, biodiversity, climate). Strategies are needed to balance market incentives, safeguard food supply and the environment, and support farmers in diversifying incomes through sustainable business models and value chains. Successful proposals should support the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Common Agricultural Policy, the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) Regulation and the climate and biodiversity objectives of the European Green Deal.\nProposals should:\n- explore natural capital accounting methods integrating economics and nature into agricultural accounts, and their potential to support economic valuation, pricing and integration in decision-making of environmental services provided by farmers;\n- analyse existing and develop new innovative business models and value chains from which farmers can derive fair value and new income beyond food and feed production. This work should include, among others, an assessment of their potential to integrate sustainable practices, enhance farm profitability and performance, and support the transition to a circular bio-based economy and the green transition, as well as an assessment of the market operators involved;\n- when conducting the research/assessment, consider the potential of biomass residues and secondary biomass streams, including waste, as well as low value, unused or underutilised biomass, and land areas;\n- conduct interdisciplinary research from farm to macro levels, encompassing economic, social, biodiversity and climate impacts, and provide analytical tools in particular assessing implications for: farmers' income, decision-making and farm management including of its natural capital ; biomass supply and demand and threshold effects of market prices on production choices; land-use conflicts and food security risks (covering the availability, accessibility, utilisation and stability dimensions), considering leakage effects and other potential conflicts of use (e.g. water);\n- provide recommendations for the design of policies and sustainable business models and value chains. The recommendations should anticipate trade-offs and align bioeconomy, climate and biodiversity goals while safeguarding food security and ensuring that farmers can diversify and receive fair incomes. They should also respond to evolving consumer demand.\nProposals should ensure complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded LIFE and knowledge innovation projects, studies, pilot projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., Economic Accounts for Agriculture framework).\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities).\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, farm accountants, and businesses.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] in the environment, biological & food domains.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

      "scope": "The European industry must transition to a greener, more sustainable model to enhance its competitiveness against other business models and foster the production of novel high-value sustainable products. Achieving this requires a shift towards a bio-based system, which leverages biological processes to deliver products that contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing environmental impact and can compete with and eventually replace traditional models. For instance, the current use of hazardous chemicals in various industries, such as the textile and polymer industries, requires the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives.\nIn this context, the vast and largely untapped diversity of marine organisms—including fungi, algae, and invertebrates—presents a valuable source of biomolecules with unique properties. These marine-derived compounds hold significant potential across a range of applications, for example from construction materials, chemical processes to bioplastics and textiles. Supporting research and innovation in blue biotechnology fosters the transition toward greener, high-performance products across multiple industries.\nProposals should address the following:\n- develop safe and sustainable blue bio-based products, by exploring the use of the unique physical, chemical and biochemical properties of biomolecules from marine organisms (e.g., adhesion, structural organization, fluorescence, luminescence). Proposals in scope include novel adhesion agents or bonding products, biochemicals to replace hazardous chemicals, antifouling paintings and coatings, replacement for synthetic surfactants, biomarkers, biosensors, enzymes. Proposals aiming to develop molecules with important economic or societal impact are encouraged. The applications in health biotechnology, as well as the biofuel/bioenergy area are excluded, to avoid overlaps with Horizon Europe Clusters 1 and 5, respectively;\n- incorporate the use of synthetic and engineering biology approaches and foresee the necessary links with the digital technologies and tools (AI/ML, bioinformatics);\n- include the assessment of the costs and benefits compared to conventional alternatives in the market. Proposals should look into regulatory, market and value chain bottlenecks;\n- assess the safety, environmental sustainability and effectiveness of the developed bio-based products derived from marine environments compared to the equivalent material on the market;\n- develop recommendations for policy makers and industrial actors, considering the available scientifically sound assessment of risks and benefits of the developed solutions.\nProposals should cover the innovation chain from research, to development, and proof of concept. Legal aspects linked to securing clear access to marine resources, including related infrastructures and bio-resources banks and collections, their sustainable use as well as access and benefit sharing aspects, should be properly considered. Marine resources can be obtained sustainably from natural environments, as well as from publicly or privately accessible collections. The harvesting or utilization of sentient marine animals, including invertebrates, must be carefully evaluated to ensure that ethical and moral considerations are adequately addressed.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] , such as EMSO ERIC, EU-OPENSCREEN, ELIXIR, EMBRC ERIC, IBISBA. Efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders to maximize the impact and use of the developed products, including but not limited to economic and financial actors. International cooperation, for example with Latin America and Caribbean countries, is encouraged.\nProposals are expected to establish synergies and links with relevant projects funded under the Horizon Europe CL6 Work Programmes 2021-2025 [2] and with actions supported by the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU) and the Sustainable Blue Partnership (SBEP) ensuring that any potential overlaps or duplications are avoided.\nProjects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the European Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act, the EU Algae Initiative, the European Ocean Pact, the EU strategy on research and technology infrastructures, and the new approach for a sustainable blue economy .\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[2] E.g.

      "scope": "Agriculture and forestry are among the sectors most directly impacted by climate change, while also playing important roles in its mitigation, through greenhouse gas emissions, their reduction and carbon removals from the atmosphere. These roles are addressed in horizontal EU climate policies such as the Regulations on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) [1] and on Effort-sharing [2] or the forthcoming Climate Adaptation Plan, as well as in sectoral policies, most notably the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with a host of relevant rules and voluntary measures. The climate performance in agriculture and forestry is indirectly also affected by many other policies and measures, be they sectoral (e.g., on market organisation or on income support) or horizontal (e.g., on competitiveness). Depending on their design and application, climate policies in turn also have impacts beyond their immediate objectives, e.g. on competitiveness, income distribution, and biodiversity and nature protection. Apart from policies applicable in the EU and its Member States and in Associated Countries, the outcomes in each of these jurisdictions are also impacted by rules and standards applied in other parts of the world, through international markets and other transboundary effects.\nWhile efforts are made in some contexts to expand the scope of regular policy evaluations, so that they also include “external factors” and unintended consequences, this poses significant challenges methodologically and in terms of data and thus often remains an afterthought in analyses focused on individual policies or sectors. There is a need for more aggregate consideration of the full spectrum of levers impacting on climate outcomes, in a comparative and systemic perspective, with a view to improving the overall effectiveness, fairness and coherence of public policies.\nProposals should:\n- making use inter alia of advanced technological potentials for accelerated evidence synthesis, take stock of existing analyses and evidence on the performance of sectoral and horizontal instruments affecting climate-change mitigation and adaptation in the agricultural and forestry sectors, also in terms of the distribution of costs and benefits within and across sectors and societies;\n- design and carry out research to fill gaps in the understanding of the above questions, covering a broad range of policy instruments across relevant outcomes and include compound effects on other policy objectives as well as spill-overs from climate-relevant policies with a different (primary) objective, including biodiversity and nature protection;\n- for the agricultural and forestry sectors address adaptation as well as mitigation-related policies and outcomes and assess how (and with how much success) their interconnections have been reflected in relevant policies and institutions, identifying relevant enabling conditions;\n- develop frameworks for assessing overall policy outcomes across potentially conflicting objectives and identify specific leverage points for realistically improving aggregate outcomes, taking into account any existing review processes or mechanisms.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures in the environmental, biological and food domains.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 02018R0841-20230511 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] Regulation - 2023/857 - EN - EUR-Lex",

      "scope": "Water infrastructures both for drinking water supply and wastewater collection and treatment suffer from a lack of sufficient and continuous investment across Europe. Their conditions are evolving differently depending on the investment capacity of local authorities and/or water companies, as well as the climate and pollution conditions they are exposed to. They are often not flexible enough to adapt to a changing and increasingly unpredictable environment and lack of appropriate monitoring to properly understand their functioning in various operating conditions. On the treatment side, the technological processes are not always coping with pollution load variation or new contaminants threatening human health and downstream ecosystems. They are also more and more exposed to the risk of malicious attacks, being of human or cyber nature.\nWith the effect of climate change as well as the emergence of new threats from chemical, biological, human and cyber origins, it is necessary to develop and test a set of tools to ensure that water and sanitation provision is resilient now and for the future, building on the solutions that emerged in the sector or adapted from other sectors.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address some or all the elements below:\n- develop and integrate modular processes and tools to improve the adaptability of drinking water and wastewater infrastructures to emerging pollutions and effects of climate change;\n- integrate Nature-based Solutions infrastructures to reduce the carbon footprint of water infrastructure, better manage water flows and pollutants entering sewers, and support biodiversity;\n- enhance the use of digital solutions, new monitoring techniques, Earth observation tools, digital twin technology and artificial intelligence, including for predictive analytics, within drinking water and wastewater infrastructures to optimise their operation, anticipate infrastructure challenges and pollution and improve their efficiency and resilience, addressing leakages, infiltration, energy consumption, recovery of materials and carbon footprint;\n- develop robust data sharing framework to promote secure collaboration among stakeholders and identify interdependencies with other critical infrastructures in a resilience-based approach;\n- develop tools, approaches and procedures to protect both the physical and digital water infrastructures against malicious attacks.\nProposals are encouraged to explore the use of blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to ensure data integrity, enable smart-contract–based service automation, and support novel financing or certification schemes for future water infrastructures. Given the high degree of integration of the topic with existing infrastructures, proposals should target a large variety of stakeholders ranging from universities, SMEs, water utilities, energy utilities, etc.\nProposals should also seek to contribute to the further development of existing observing platforms and initiatives, including to the evolution of Copernicus services and the future EU Digital Twin on freshwater and Destination Earth. It should also contribute to define the bases for a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) sharing of data in the water sector in collaboration with the initiative conducted by the co-funded partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All).\nAll in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories (e.g. Copernicus). supported by the European Commission.\nProposals should also build on the results of previous projects funded under previous framework programmes, especially the projects related to the cluster ICT4Water. They should also foster complementarities and avoid overlapping with projects funded under the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030 and the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change. Finally, it should also look for collaboration with projects from Horizon Europe Cluster 3 in relation to security, where appropriate. The JRC may contribute with technical analysis and research on digital technologies for water management and monitoring, including real-world test cases.\nInternational cooperation is strongly encouraged.",

      "scope": "The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the long-term vision for EU’s rural areas, the vision for agriculture and food and its objective to foster fair living and working conditions in vibrant rural areas, climate objectives, as well as the competitiveness compass which, among its three core areas for action, aims at closing the innovation gap for the EU to boost its competitiveness.\nRegaining competitiveness is essential to ensuring long-term prosperity in the EU. However, not all territories have equal access to resources and opportunities. Efforts to enhance competitiveness must therefore also prioritise environmental and social sustainability ensuring that neither nature nor people are left behind in the pursuit of economic growth.\nAlthough rural areas often possess natural resources and are essential to support the provision of ecosystem services, they frequently face societal (e.g., declining and ageing populations, social exclusion and inequality) and market failures (e.g., under-provision of essential services, limited access to finance and infrastructure, digital divide, labour market mismatches) that hinder sustainable development, social inclusion, and competitiveness.\nProposals should:\n- improve the understanding of the drivers and obstacles of sustainable competitiveness in the contexts of societal and market failures in rural areas, and propose indicators to measure competitiveness that incorporate social and environmental performance;\n- support startups and/or businesses led by young [1] rural entrepreneurs to design, prototype and test sustainable digital, technological, nature-based and/or social solutions to improve access to services and/or create business opportunities in diverse rural settings; in addition, propose mechanisms to share these solutions among rural areas through translocal networks;\n- improve access to digital and hybrid education and training for rural communities to acquire new skills and support entrepreneurial mind-sets, in particular among young people, as well as link university graduates with young rural entrepreneurs to share knowledge and possibly create new collaborations;\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties in particular to support start up or businesses. The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 60 000.\nProposals are expected to build upon already existing results and to search collaboration with the other action funded under this topic and with other relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe. Proposals should include a task and appropriate resources to ensure these collaborations.\nProposals should also allocate appropriate resources to coordinate their work with relevant initiatives developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), particularly in the context of the Rural Observatory and the Startup Village Forum initiative.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines (e.g., economics, business and administration, education science, gender studies) and the involvement of SSH experts.\nProposals must consider gender in all aspects of project design and implementation, particularly in data analysis, support for start-ups and businesses, the development of solutions, as well as the provision of education and training opportunities.\n[1] Indicatively, 'young' is understood to mean up to a maximum of 40 years old.",

      "scope": "Effective plant health measures play a vital role in protecting agriculture and supporting global food security, safeguarding the environment, forests, and biodiversity, and enabling safe international trade. Among these measures, (post-harvest) phytosanitary treatments [1] — such as vapour, heat, cold, irradiation, and controlled atmosphere — are critical tools to prevent the introduction and spread of regulated plant pests [2] through imported goods.\nHowever, the current range of available phytosanitary treatments remains limited. In many cases, existing methods lack proven efficacy against specific pests, or scientifically sound protocols are unavailable. Moreover, practical challenges related to the implementation, scalability, potential health and environmental impact of these treatments often hinder their widespread adoption.\nThis action aims to stimulate innovation in phytosanitary (post-harvest) treatment solutions [3] to be used in trade.\nProposals should:\n- develop innovative, cost-effective (post-harvest) phytosanitary treatment(s) to prevent the introduction of pests through imports, with a specific focus on EU quarantine pests [4] ;\n- test and validate the proposed treatment(s) considering economic, technical, human health and environmental dimensions;\n- asses the cost-effectiveness, feasibility, scalability and practical applicability of the proposed treatment(s) under operational conditions;\n- evaluate efficacy and specificity of the treatment(s), establishing scientifically sound and user-friendly protocols and operational guidelines to ensure consistent application, safety and regulatory compliance.\nProposals should either address Area A: treatment(s) applicable to wood and wood products or Area B: post-harvest treatment(s) for fruits and vegetables. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, test and demonstrate the innovative treatments solutions in diverse contexts involving SMEs.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the common agricultural policy, align with the Vision for Agriculture and Food, and support Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 on protective measures against pests of plants.\n[1] Treatment (as phytosanitary measures) is the official procedure for killing, inactivating, removing, rendering infertile or devitalizing regulated pest.

Climate change compounds this issue by enabling pests to survive milder winters, expand their ranges, and increase their exposure to pesticides—accelerating the development of resistance. Addressing this complex issue requires a comprehensive, science-based systemic approach that integrates early detection, adaptive management, and long-term foresight to reduce resistance risks and strengthen the sustainability and resilience of agriculture and forestry. It is also relevant to acknowledge that while pesticides are important short-term solutions, the long-term solutions require shifts in current agriculture or forestry practices and system-level transformations within agri-food systems that would boost the resilience of these production environments, while preserving biodiversity.\nProposals should:\n- map resistance risks by assessing the current and projected emergence of pest resistance, considering the declining number of available active substances [2] and the authorised products for different crops;\n- develop early detection methods and predictive modelling (including AI-driven approaches) to anticipate and monitor the evolution of pesticide resistance, integrating advanced measurements tools and risk assessment methodologies, notably when products are used at farm level;\n- design and evaluate innovative integrated pest and weed management (IPWM) strategies that reduce resistance risks by expanding non-chemical preventive and curative options, optimising the rotation and combination of (agroecological) farming practices, and applying advanced technologies for precise and targeted pesticide use, while capitalising on the results of previous and ongoing initiatives;\n- innovate storage and handling practices to reduce resistance pressure during post-harvest stages;\n- support foresight activities to anticipate, mitigate and prevent resistance impacts by exploring interactions among technological, environmental, and socio-economic drivers, assessing planned resistance-management strategies against various future scenarios, establishing long-term resistance monitoring, and integrating foresight outputs into decision-making and adaptive management through collaboration across research, farming and forestry sectors, industry, stakeholder networks, and policymakers;\n- enhance capacity-building, stakeholder engagement and communication through awareness-raising, sensitisation, education, and the co-creation of solutions with end-users.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings, knowledge, solutions and tools, from past and ongoing projects and collaborate with ongoing initiatives.

      "scope": "The Vision for Agriculture and Food [1] recognises organic farming as an approach with potential to ensure an attractive and predictable agri-food sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive, while at the same time delivering several ecosystem services beneficial for the environment, climate and biodiversity. The Vision also recognises the importance of research and innovation (R&I) for sustainable farming approaches, such as organic farming, to thrive. At the same time, the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production [2] attaches a central role to R&I for achieving the Plan’s objectives. In line with this Action Plan, under Horizon Europe, the EU has funded several R&I projects addressing multiple aspects and challenges of organic production. The purpose of this topic is to fill remaining R&I needs to boost the organic farming sector in Europe.\nProposals should increase knowledge and develop safe, viable and cost-effective innovations to tackle agronomic, sustainability (social, biodiversity, climate, economic), value chain development and/or market-related challenges of organic production. Proposals should develop innovations addressing land-based organic production in a range of pedo-climatic conditions in the EU and Associated Countries. They should demonstrate the contribution of these innovations to facilitating the uptake and implementation of organic production methods by relevant stakeholders, among which farmers. This should include activities to increase networking and knowledge and best practice exchange among farmers (both among organic farmers and with farmers implementing other approaches) and with other relevant actors.\nProposals should establish sites in diverse pedo-climatic conditions to co-create, test, validate and upscale the innovations, and set-up a network connecting these sites.\nBoth crop and livestock production systems under organic production are in scope of this topic. Proposals should convincingly explain how they will fill existing R&I needs in line with the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [3] and the Vision for Agriculture and Food [4] . The projects under this topic are also relevant to the EU policies related to the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as the EU’s biodiversity, zero pollution and climate policies.\nIf proposals relate to some of the activities covered by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (including the CORE Organic ERA-Net), to the Horizon Europe Cluster 6 Work Programmes 2021-2022, 2023-2024 or 2025, to projects funded under the EU Mission Soil [5] , and/or to projects funded under the Horizon Europe Partnerships ‘Agroecology’ [6] , Animal Health and Welfare [7] or FutureFoods [8] , they should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, as well as with other relevant ongoing EU-funded organic farming relevant projects, and with projects funded by the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ or other Horizon Europe Partnerships. Activities falling under the scope of the topics ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-BIODIV-09: Enhancing the competitiveness of organic crop breeding: focus on intercropping adapted varieties’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-04: Improving understanding of the contribution of the organic farming sector to sustainability’ in this Work Programme are out of the scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of farmers and other relevant stakeholders involved in the organic farming agri-food value chain, taking into account a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach. The type and nature of stakeholders involved besides farmers should be determined in function of the specific challenge/area addressed. Sectors with high economic relevance in different pedo-climatic conditions and various biogeographical regions across Europe should be targeted in a representative way.\nBeneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties in order to support value chain actors in co-creating, testing, validating and/or upscaling the developed innovations. Proposals should promote close cooperation among relevant research and innovation actors across the EU and Associated Countries, ultimately leading to a more efficient organic production R&I ecosystem by linking up to existing related EU-wide initiatives, in particular the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/overview-vision-agriculture-food/vision-agriculture-and-food_en\n[2] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[4] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0075\n[5] https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/\n[6] https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/funded-projects\n[7] https://www.eupahw.eu/\n[8] https://www.futurefoodspartnership.eu/",

      "scope": "Protein crops [1] can play a key role in advancing sustainable and resilient European agriculture offering environmental, agronomic, economic and nutritional benefits. Despite their potential, the production and use of protein crops in Europe remains limited and require targeted efforts to scale up. Several barriers continue to hinder their development, including the lack of adapted local protein crops for the different European environmental conditions, the limited availability of effective and safe pest management practices and tools, the inadequacy of the machinery used in their production, poor infrastructure for processing and marketing, the absence of well-established local value chains, etc. A key element for a wide adoption of protein crops by farmers is demonstrating their potential benefits (economic competitiveness, environmental impacts, social engagement, adaptability) that enhance their market value and appeal.\nProposals should:\n- develop innovative solutions tailored to different conditions across the EU (agro-climatic, edaphic, socio-economic), to address key challenges hindering the inclusion of protein crops into diverse cropping systems. This should be done at farm level (addressing for instance yield, quality, resource optimization and resilience of protein crops under varying climatic and soil conditions) as well as the whole agri-food value chain (such as access to marketing outlets), increasing the competitiveness of protein crops;\n- promote circular bioeconomy by valorising protein crops’ by-products to develop economically viable and resilient farming models that enhance farmer profitability and reduce production risks. Explore and demonstrate innovative pathways for converting protein crops’ by-products into safe feed and food sources. If relevant, build on already identified protein crop by-products and value chains to develop concrete case studies that showcase practical circular and successful business models;\n- develop or adapt innovative and scalable integrated pest [2] and weed management strategies tailored for protein crops to enhance crop resilience, soil health, and productivity across a wide range of production systems and climate conditions, while limiting the impact on the environment and ensuring food safety;\n- conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit evaluation of the proposed approaches and solutions to ensure overall feasibility across diverse farming system;\n- explore, test and adapt available machinery for sowing, field management, harvesting and postharvest operations, tailored to different protein crops. Consider, if relevant, the integration of digital/AI tools. Propose viable avenues for increasing access to this specific equipment, including through cooperatives/producers’ associations or collaborating with SMEs/startups;\n- support farmers to transition to the incorporation of protein crops in the European production systems by widely sharing practical knowledge through existing advisory networks, digital platforms or capacity building programmes and potentially deployed at large scale. Create diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, such as audiovisuals, brochures, presentations, that showcase innovations in a creative way, incorporating artistic elements for engaging storytelling.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together. An active participation of farmers, retailers, SMEs and consumers is encouraged, in local protein crops value chains, through the development of near-farm activities to drive local innovation. Beneficiaries. may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, engage SME’s or startups to develop, test and demonstrate the proposed innovative solutions.\nProposals should address diverse farming systems/approaches, including conventional and organic farming.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other relevant projects in particular those to be funded under the topic \"HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-05: Enhancing farmers profitability and resilience through innovations for diversified crops and value chains\".

      "scope": "Despite the crucial role that woody perennial crops such as fruits and nuts play in our diets, as well as their importance for global economies, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, traditional breeding methods for these crops remain slow and labour-intensive due to long gestation periods (juvenile phase) and complex genetics. This hinders the timely development of perennial breeds to cope with challenges like climate change, pests and diseases, impacting among others crop productivity. Developing user-friendly tools that can be effectively transferred to breeders will boost the impact and efficiency of breeding programs for perennial crops.\nProposals should:\n- develop new and/or improved tools and methods aimed at shortening generation time and overall breeding cycle in perennial crops, while enhancing sustainability traits such as pest and disease resistance, yield stability, quality and adaptation to climate changes;\n- assess the scalability and accessibility of the tools and methods and ensure the provision of the required dataset and info for their effective implementation;\n- implement genomic selection tools and models – taking into account interactions between genotypes and environment - into actual breeding schemes for perennial crops and study the empirical results of these models to determine their accuracy, reliability, and applicability and improve their effectiveness for commercial settings;\n- validate the tools across different species or breeding objectives to ensure reliability and replicability and develop standardized protocols and guidelines for their use in consultation with breeders to facilitate the effective adoption and utilisation of the tools/methods;\n- evaluate the newly developed tools and methods for potential trade-offs, unintended outcomes and potential effects on the environment.\nAll breeding approaches are in the scope of this topic. Proposals should target fruit and/or nut crops [1] .\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, cross-test the tools developed in different species and facilitate the engagement of SMEs for testing in commercial settings.\nProposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe and ensure collaboration with relevant ongoing projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructure [2] in the environment, biological and food domains.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food by promoting plant breeding innovations, including new genomic techniques (NGTs), the Commission communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU [3] and the Life Sciences Strategy.\n[1] According to the FAO Indicative Crop Classification (ICC) presented in the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020 (Annex 4 - Group 3, under the voice ’Fruit and nuts’), with the exclusion of berries.\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ .\n[3] COM (2024)137 final.",

      "scope": "Boosting circularity and diversification strategies of livestock production systems by integrating for example diverse animal breeds and species, multiple animal products and by-products, and sustainable land-use approaches like mixed crop-livestock systems and agroforestry can help to reduce environmental ad climate impact, to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, to minimize waste, and to enhance overall farming system resilience to environmental and economic shocks. Such strategies can provide alternative revenue streams (e.g., meat, dairy, wool, eggs, wood, fruit, manure, ecosystem services/carbon credits), improve farmers’ income stability, reduce dependency on external inputs and on single-product markets, and create more sustainable farms and rural economies.\nFarmers are increasingly interested in diverse and circular livestock farming strategies, but the efficiency, profitability, trade-offs, interactions, and co-benefits of these strategies vary by region, farm type, and economic conditions. The aim is to assess the real short- and long-term impact and scalability of these strategies in different pedo-climatic regions and in various terrestrial livestock systems, including organic farming. It is important to investigate local agricultural and agro-industrial resources, including residues, by-products and co-products that are not valorised to produce energy or bio-based chemicals for the wider bioeconomy (such as bioenergy, biopolymers/biomaterials), but instead remain within the farming system for circular uses such as animal feed, soil amendments, organic fertilizers, and other innovative uses.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n- develop and validate innovative strategies and tools, including monitoring systems, to optimize diversification and circularity in terrestrial livestock farming systems at multiple levels (e.g., animals, products, by-products, farm, land) and scales (spatial, organizational and temporal). This includes valorising resources, by-products, residues and waste, closing the nutrient loops, and enhancing resilience, sustainability, biodiversity and profitability while considering the specific local context and needs of rural areas, and ensuring that food safety is maintained;\n- foster the utilisation of locally available value-added products, co-products and by-products from terrestrial livestock farming systems, taking into account the EU regulatory framework and relevant standards, while assessing synergies, trade-offs, and possible interactions between resource use, efficiency, circularity and sustainability;\n- enhance exchange among the participants along the value chain of information, good practices and innovations on circularity and diversification, including logistic, governance and business models that help in sharing local resources, aggregating supply, improving the bargaining power of farmers through cooperative structures and preserving the cultural heritage related to traditional local rural production;\n- analyse the social and economic viability of the diversified and circular livestock farming systems, with particular attention to market trends and value chain analysis, including traceability, and their contribution to sustainable rural development;\n- provide scientific evidence and policy advice that support the assessment of the current EU regulatory framework relevant to the sector and to existing or novel products derived from animal and agricultural by-products.\nProposals should either address Area A: any terrestrial livestock production system or Area B: production system on the wool value chain (i.e. fiber animal production systems). The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Green Deal’s objectives for resilient and sustainable agri-food systems, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU climate policy and the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic production [1] .\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in animal husbandry in Europe, including farmers, shepherds and relevant organisations notably in the livestock sectors, territorial planners, advisors, private sector/industry (e.g. processors, retailers, distributors), policy-makers, consumers, etc.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects, where relevant.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

      "scope": "Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) refers to any form of agriculture that controls and optimises environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light or nutrient concentration. Examples of CEA include greenhouses, vertical farms, grow rooms, building-integrated agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, as well as other innovative farming practices - both off land and land based - where technological advancements enable precise regulation of growing conditions farming.\nBy developing innovative farming techniques that integrate the latest technological advancements including artificial intelligence (AI), this research should provide a competitive and sustainable transformation in response to global food security and sustainability challenges. Furthermore, it should also empower farmers and key stakeholders in the agricultural primary sector by enabling them to adopt sustainable, efficient, profitable, circular, and low-emission farming practices. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and AI-driven solutions, the activities should contribute to the overarching goals of climate neutrality and climate resilience, reinforcing the EU’s commitment to a sustainable agricultural future.\nProposals should:\n- develop and assess advanced cost-effective innovative and sustainable solutions (including nature-based solutions) to address the key challenges (including climate change related and environmental) for crop optimisation in CEA. The assessment should address, among other, crop health and yield, energy efficiency, water use efficiency, nutrient management, environmental conditions, cost-effectiveness, automation and technology integration, sustainability and environmental impact, food safety, pest and disease management, scalability and adaptability;\n- develop data-driven decision-making smart automation and precision farming techniques, as well as predictive analytics for plant growth optimisation (e.g. via AI modelling);\n- explore appropriate new business and cooperation models adapted to proposed solutions, taking into account organisation and distribution concepts, and marketability of the resulting products. Consider requirements from relevant EU regulatory frameworks including where relevant needs for pre-market authorisation;\n- foster knowledge sharing including by training to test and adopt the innovative solutions, and informed advice for improved competitiveness and sustainability of CEA.\nProposals should develop innovative solutions in both conventional and organic production systems. The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the European Green Deal policies dealing with environment protection and climate change, and the Apply AI Strategy.\nActivities should fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach and allow for adequate involvement of relevant actors including farmers, SMEs, start-ups, scientists and developers.\nTo effectively transition these innovations into the market, SMEs should actively be involved in this process. Activities are expected to achieve Technological Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.\nProposals may involve financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs providing and/or developing testing, or validating the proposed innovative technologies/solutions. A maximum 30% of EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings from past and ongoing research projects and especially seek synergy with the other project to be selected under this topic and with the project to be selected from the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-08: Exploring the potential of controlled environment agriculture (CEA).\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

However, the introduction of alternatives in the form of biological or innovative low-risk plant protection products has not followed with the same pace as the withdrawal of active substances from the EU market. If this trend continues, it could affect the EU’s ability to ensure food security and sovereignty.\nTo ensure a smooth transition, coordinated action is needed. Strengthening dialogue, guiding research, and supporting innovation should equip policymakers and sectors to adapt and build a resilient, nature and biodiversity-friendly crop protection system.\nProposals should:\n- establish or reinforce an inclusive, multi-actor platform for an EU-wide network to facilitate dialogue, knowledge exchange, cooperation among policymakers, regulatory bodies, farmer organisations, researchers, industry actors, and other stakeholders;\n- provide guidance to identify critical uses of active substances at risk of withdrawal, assess potential agronomic and economic impacts and map existing alternatives, including those that support agro-biodiversity, and research needs;\n- facilitate targeted discussions to prioritise the most affected crops and regions, define pathways for the development and adoption of alternative solutions with a priority on issues where a risk of deadlock situation has been identified as a result of the withdrawal of harmful pesticides, and shape strategic research and innovation agendas;\n- support agricultural sectors in co-developing actionable plans — from early-stage research to field-level deployment — that address the impacts of substance withdrawals and foster mutual learning across sectors and EU Member States.\nProposals should consider the perspectives and needs of the different 27 EU Member States to ensure a high level of representation. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The participation could involve contributing to prioritization of critical active substances based on the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of the pests controlled by the active substances and assessment of the acceptability of alternative solutions by agents in the food system.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects and collaborate with projects funded in HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-02: Tackling pesticide resistance: early detection, management strategies, and foresight.",

      "scope": "The world’s migratory species are in decline, and their global extinction risk is increasing, with a growing part of this acceleration linked to climate change and a deterioration of their migration routes. Migratory marine fish stocks - ranging across a wide size spectrum - are vital for ecosystem functioning and food security, as their long-term persistence depends on management approaches that balance sustainability with ecological resilience in a system of global change. Furthermore, diadromous fish species play a critical role in land-sea interactions across their ranges, providing unique financial and non-financial societal goods and benefits to society and nature, such as marine-derived nutrient flows to rivers and lands, and exceptional cultural values. Ability of these species to connect and utilise a variety of habitats over long distances, makes them 'umbrella' species, meaning conservation measures for these species benefit broader ecosystems. Protecting these species and sustainably managing the bio-resources they provide across national and international waters, and often multi-national catchments require a holistic and coordinated approach, integrating local attitudes, uses, knowledge, policies and conservation measures, and adapted to local circumstances where necessary.\nProposals should:\n- develop methods and methodologies, where relevant at regional scale or global scale, to assess the effectiveness of conservation and management measures that will allow for adaptive management;\n- develop tools and practices to reduce anthropogenic mortality factors for these species and in all key lifetime aquatic habitats and to avoid fragmented non-coordinated management across sectors and countries;\n- generate new knowledge on the interplay between climatic and non-climatic pressures, particularly related to fisheries of marine species, or in relation to infrastructure impeding connectivity (e.g. hydropower, pumping stations, flood control) and pollution for the diadromous species;\n- assess the impact of emerging pressures on the migratory species of interest;\n- assess the ecosystem services and the resulting societal goods and benefits provided by long-ranging migrating and/or transboundary land-sea-connecting species;\n- strengthen data collection systems covering all life-history stages and successive key habitats of these migratory fish, to improve monitoring coordination across regions and countries;\n- incorporate relevant stakeholders and end-users from the design phase through development and implementation, ensuring that outputs can be readily applied by them.\nThe scope includes migratory marine and diadromous species of commercial interest, with particular emphasis on endangered species and endangered local populations. Where applicable, considerations related to farming of migratory species should be addressed.\nProposals should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities disciplines. Citizen science is encouraged at all stages of the research activities for this topic.\nProjects are expected to contribute to the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the European Ocean Pact, the Vision for Fisheries and Aquaculture with a 2040 perspective, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directives, the Water Framework Directive, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the Food 2030 policy framework, the Nature Restoration Regulation.",

It is thus crucial to tackle the impact of plant pests in an integrated manner, while ensuring this is done through technologies and practices fostering agricultural sustainability, resilience to climate change and safeguarding biodiversity.\nProposals should:\n- advance knowledge on biology, mechanism of disease, spread dynamics, and climate change impacts on key plant pests across different African agro-ecosystems, considering also climate change impacts;\n- develop cost-effective, environmentally friendly methods, tools and strategies that are safe to consumers for the sustainable management of the most impactful plant pests in Africa, aiming to minimise crop losses both at pre-harvest and during storage of harvests;\n- foster agroecological integrated pest management practices aiming at reducing the impact of plant pests;\n- improve productivity and the quality of crop products in the African agricultural systems by reducing the impact of plant pests.\nInsects, weeds, fungi, bacteria, and viruses that can damage crops fall within the scope of this topic and are considered plant pests. Applicants are expected to explain and justify the choice of pest(s) in alignment with the proposal’s objectives and the topic’s expected outcomes.\nThe actions funded under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Global Gateway strategy, contribute to the African Union-EU High Level Policy Dialogue on Science, Technology and Innovation and to the respective R&I partnerships on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA) and on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy. Projects under this topic are relevant for the climate objectives of the African Union and the EU, and for the commitments of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nProposals should contribute to the implementation of the short-term and medium-term actions outlined in the AU-EU Innovation Agenda [1] in the priority area of Green Transition (notably action (4) among short-term actions and (1) and (3) for medium-term actions), and aim to translate R&I efforts into tangible business, products, services, development and employment opportunities in Africa and Europe.\nFurthermore, when relevant proposals are encouraged to seek connections with Regional Multi-actors Research Networks on Agroecology supported by the EC in Africa [2] .\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach to ensure the adequate involvement of the public authorities, advisory services, farmer organisations, and industry.\nProposals should adopt an inclusive approach that respects and integrates local knowledge and practices alongside technological and scientific expertise, where indigenous insights are enriched by innovative approaches and new technologies through mutual learning.\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/new-eu-africa-innovation-agenda-enhance-cooperation-science-technology-and-innovation-2023-07-20_en\n[2] Regional Multi-Actor Research Network on Agroecology to Support Regional Centres of Excellence related to the Green Transition ; RMRN Western Africa: CORAF & Cheikh-Anta-Diop de Dakar for Western Africa ; RMRN Eastern Africa : Icipe and partners",

      "scope": "The Vision for Agriculture and Food [1] recognises organic farming as an approach with potential to ensure an attractive and predictable agri-food sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive, while at the same time delivering several ecosystem services beneficial for the environment, climate and biodiversity. The Vision also recognises the importance of research and innovation (R&I) for sustainable farming approaches, such as organic farming, to thrive. At the same time, the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production [2] attaches a central role to R&I for achieving the Plan’s objectives. In line with this Action Plan, under Horizon Europe, the EU has funded several R&I projects addressing multiple aspects and challenges of organic production. The purpose of this topic is to fill remaining R&I needs to boost the organic farming sector in Europe.\nProposals should increase knowledge and develop safe, viable and cost-effective innovations to tackle agronomic, sustainability (social, biodiversity, climate, economic), value chain development and/or market-related challenges of organic production. Proposals should develop innovations addressing land-based organic production in a range of pedo-climatic conditions in the EU and Associated Countries. They should demonstrate the contribution of these innovations to facilitating the uptake and implementation of organic production methods by relevant stakeholders, among which farmers. This should include activities to increase networking and knowledge and best practice exchange among farmers (both among organic farmers and with farmers implementing other approaches) and with other relevant actors.\nProposals should establish sites in diverse pedo-climatic conditions to co-create, test, validate and upscale the innovations, and set-up a network connecting these sites.\nBoth crop and livestock production systems under organic production are in scope of this topic. Proposals should convincingly explain how they will fill existing R&I needs in line with the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [3] and the Vision for Agriculture and Food [4] . The projects under this topic are also relevant to the EU policies related to the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as the EU’s biodiversity, zero pollution and climate policies.\nIf proposals relate to some of the activities covered by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (including the CORE Organic ERA-Net), to the Horizon Europe Cluster 6 Work Programmes 2021-2022, 2023-2024 or 2025, to projects funded under the EU Mission Soil [5] , and/or to projects funded under the Horizon Europe Partnerships ‘Agroecology’ [6] , Animal Health and Welfare [7] or FutureFoods [8] , they should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, as well as with other relevant ongoing EU-funded organic farming relevant projects, and with projects funded by the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ or other Horizon Europe Partnerships. Activities falling under the scope of the topics ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-BIODIV-09: Enhancing the competitiveness of organic crop breeding: focus on intercropping adapted varieties’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-04: Improving understanding of the contribution of the organic farming sector to sustainability’ in this Work Programme are out of the scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of farmers and other relevant stakeholders involved in the organic farming agri-food value chain, taking into account a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach. The type and nature of stakeholders involved besides farmers should be determined in function of the specific challenge/area addressed. Sectors with high economic relevance in different pedo-climatic conditions and various biogeographical regions across Europe should be targeted in a representative way.\nBeneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties in order to support value chain actors in co-creating, testing, validating and/or upscaling the developed innovations. Proposals should promote close cooperation among relevant research and innovation actors across the EU and Associated Countries, ultimately leading to a more efficient organic production R&I ecosystem by linking up to existing related EU-wide initiatives, in particular the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/overview-vision-agriculture-food/vision-agriculture-and-food_en\n[2] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[4] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0075\n[5] https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/\n[6] https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/funded-projects\n[7] https://www.eupahw.eu/\n[8] https://www.futurefoodspartnership.eu/",

The third instalment of the partnership is expected to contribute to expected outcomes specified in topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1.",
      "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership for a climate-neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy (SBEP) identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of the existing topic and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in year 2022 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented, in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to the initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe scope of the application for this call on the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership should focus on the 2023-27 programmes according to the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years. It should pursue alignment, cooperation and structuring of research and innovation efforts across the EU and national levels, focusing on regional seas and on the objectives of the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and of the European Ocean Pact, to support a just and inclusive transition to a regenerative, carbon-neutral and circular blue economy and to foster knowledge exchange and co-creation of actions with regulators, policymakers and businesses. It should also continue or expand the priority areas identified in the Strategic Research & Innovation Agenda, promoting R&I alignments across national, regional, and EU levels, and fostering integration across science, industry, governance, and society. The partnership will focus on multiple strategic areas like ocean health, sustainable blue economy, digital twins, and citizen well-being, while aligning with EU policies such as the European Green Deal and other directives. It should recognise the diversity of citizens to be involved and the vulnerability of different groups when approaching different analyses, and develop more inclusive recommendations. The Partnership should consolidate relevant structuring activities and propose additional ones (potentially done by additional partners) aiming at promoting Blue Economy Innovations, contributing to the development of the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS), for instance by facilitating and promoting coordination of cross-border ocean and coastal observations programmes, at increasing the availability of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data for environmental, climate and blue economy purposes, at exploiting the opportunities offered by Artificial Intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, etc.\nThe partnership is expected to continue to organise joint calls as part of the additional activities and therefore it should factor in ample time to run the co-funded projects.\nThe partnership's additional activities are expected to be designed and described in such a way that it is clear how they will increase scientific contributions, applicable in a legal/regulatory context, and how they will facilitate the use of scientific knowledge by regulators and policymakers and support the development of a sustainable blue economy. The additional activities are expected to be implemented through the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of researchers from different disciplines, advisors, local, regional and national authorities, government representatives, industry and businesses, including SMEs, knowledge institutions and citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and other relevant actors of the value chain, supported through Open Science practices and an inclusive governance, policy and decision-making.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and additional partners, if any, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement. The proposal should also describe the specific activities foreseen to strengthen the synergies with other related Missions and Partnerships.",

      "scope": "Knowledge gaps exist between agricultural policy priorities and data infrastructure to evaluate social sustainability issues, particularly regarding farmers. Often social issues are addressed by various policy instruments from different policy areas, but there are inconsistencies, for example in the way that target groups are identified and measured in the statistics collected at European level. A framing of the social dimension of agriculture is necessary to complement the existing environmental and economic aspects of sustainability of assessment tools, strategies and policies for agriculture in the EU. Social issues may remain hidden if there is no consistent data able to capture them. Social aspects seem to be excluded from most of the analytical tools available. Greater understanding of social issues and the best policy approaches to address them requires appropriate data to develop better indicators and measurement that can be integrated into analytical tools. Successful proposals should therefore directly and/ or indirectly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance of the sector, including social sustainability, and competitiveness in agriculture.\nProposals should:\n- identify the social impacts of agriculture on farmers (e.g., employment, demography, migration, distributional aspects, procedural justice, inclusiveness, health and well-being, social integration, gender equality, etc.), by considering various type of agricultural activities and farming methods (including organic farming) at various geographical scales, from local, national, EU to global levels;\n- map, assess and address gaps in data, indicators, and modelling approaches currently lacking social perspective by considering various type of agricultural activities and farming methods (including organic farming) to improve the assessment of social performance including determinants, synergies, trade-offs and benefits;\n- advance access, harmonize and improve interoperability of evidence/data available from observational, qualitative or case-study approaches to complement quantitative research methods. Examine networking structures to reach all relevant actors, interactions and relations, both work- and life-related;\n- test, demonstrate and pilot promising new/improved indicators, models, tools and approaches to assess social performance;\n- identify and address challenges for the EU, Member States and regions to deploy social sustainability principles in the agricultural sector and provide policy recommendations to overcome them.\n- provide recommendations on how to improve the social sustainability of the agricultural sector and ensure a just transition;\n- widely disseminate and share knowledge and solutions to policymakers, farmers, businesses and other relevant end-users in order to facilitate their uptake.\nProposals under this topic should support EU ambitions related to the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , and contribute to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food for 2040 aiming at an agri-food system that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, and thus attractive, competitive, future-proof and fair for current and future generations. Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the CAP to promote fair jobs and social inclusion for farmers, the successful proposal should support the development of innovative governance models by providing strong evidence-based knowledge and analytical capacity to support its implementation. Proposals should as well support the development and implementation of the future CAP post 2027.\nNew interdisciplinary knowledge combining economic and social sciences offer a new perspective on agricultural sciences in which social elements could be the starting point for sustainability evaluations of agricultural systems. To this purpose, proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, demography, behavioural science and education.\nProposals are expected to take into consideration the results of other related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant EU-funded projects and initiatives.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the iMAP modelling platform, sharing of information, and contribution to dissemination of results.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

These should make use of all relevant existing and upcoming EO data including Copernicus Sentinels and relevant contributing missions, as well as ground-based networks (e.g. GAW, ICOS, TCCON, etc.) and socio-economic data as relevant.\n- support international intercomparison and benchmarking (e.g. uncertainty characterization) efforts. Use cases addressing hot spot emission monitoring are particularly welcome.\n- provide clear plans for global cooperation, transition into operational services, data sharing and integration across sectors, policy uptake, knowledge exchange and capacity building activities.\nAdditionally, the action should embrace all the relevant initiatives existing at the European level and include a relevant panel of users and stakeholders at EU and national level. It should support the EU in addressing its international commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.\nThe European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) may join the consortium selected for funding as a member, or participate in the project in another way, as the tools developed under this action are relevant for JRC’s role as leader of the Copernicus CO2 Task force and can facilitate EU level assessments of greenhouse gas emissions.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.",

      "scope": "Open-source geospatial software ecosystems form a critical digital infrastructure for climate services, agriculture, biodiversity, environmental monitoring, and beyond. While Europe is home to world-class developers and software assets used globally and presenting the backbone to the modern geospatial sector (e.g. GDAL, QGIS, Pangeo stack, etc), their long-term sustainability remains challenged by fragmented, voluntary support, low visibility in funding and investment channels, and limited access to business knowledge and opportunity tailored to open-source development models.\nImportantly, many open-source projects already operate at high technology readiness levels (TRL), with active user communities, broad adoption, and demonstrated product-market fit. However, these projects often lack the business frameworks and institutional support necessary to facilitate long-term sustainability, resilience and European software sovereignty. Their challenges are distinct from those of early-stage research projects or conventional start-ups, and they require tailored approaches to governance, licensing, service monetization, and maintenance.\nTo address open-source geospatial specific challenges, proposals under this topic should:\n- establish a business incubation and support hub for the geospatial open-source community in Europe, acting as a single-entry point to foster entrepreneurship and sustained open development across critical geospatial open-source projects. To this end, the hub should identify and develop pathways for open-source geospatial software communities to partake in viable business opportunities, fostering innovation and entrepreneurial growth within the open-source ecosystem and working towards long-term sustainability of the critical geospatial open-source software ecosystem;\n- analyse the European market and innovation landscape, to identify current and future demands for geospatial open-source software across public and private sectors, identify gaps and business opportunities for commercial uptake of open-source software and the creation of business models;\n- in collaboration with the European geospatial and open-source communities, including established organisations, such as NumFOCUS, OSGeo, Linux Foundation and others, proposals should identify, and catalogue critical geospatial open-source software projects, and support fundamental, mature open-source projects with high TRL and demonstrated user traction in developing sustainability and sovereignty strategies, including tailored business strategies, IP models (where applicable), and investment readiness, to bridge the gap between open innovation and venture-ready business opportunities.\nProposals should include capacity-building elements and services, such as business mentoring, legal and IP advice, training on licensing and open business models, match making with investors, alignment with European Innovation Council (EIC) selection criteria, and community-building actions for the critical geospatial open-source projects. The applicants should furthermore plan facilitating pathways from critical open-source software to Venture Capital support, such as EIC support instruments, including Transition and Accelerator programmes.\nProposals should foresee a range of 45-60% of the proposed budget for providing financial support to third parties (FSTP), with the aim of establishing seed funding mechanisms to aid identified critical geospatial open-source projects and associated entities established in EU and Horizon Europe associated countries. In accordance with the developed critical open-source software to business and sustainability pathways, these Grants should aid critical open-source projects to implement measures to start identified business opportunities with activities such as administrative and legal set-up, productisation, business development, branding and marketing, etc.",

By blending the strengths of thematic and advisory networks, these hubs should offer services to widely disseminate information on specific themes among practitioners on the ground, contributing to a well-informed, and engaged AKIS community. Proposals should set up these hubs as a go-to source for valuable content, facilitating access to thematic research findings, innovative solutions, and best practices, empowering advisors with cutting-edge knowledge and providing ample opportunities of collaboration and cross-fertilization amongst the different AKIS actors.\nProposals should:\n- compile a comprehensive range of up-to-date scientific and practical knowledge, best practices and innovative solutions within the thematic area indicated, which are effective and ready for use in practice, but not commonly known and/or used by the end-users. This objective should be achieved by primarily drawing from existing resources, while also remaining open to incorporating new sources as they become available;\n- develop and widely share and disseminate an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing informative materials and training courses using the most effective approaches, formats, tools (including audio-visual) to reach end-users and advisors through diverse channels mostly used by practitioners. The information provided should be easy to access and understand, and translated into at least all 24 EU official languages to allow dissemination across the whole EU. Consortia should ensure collection and dissemination of knowledge from and to at least fourteen EU Member States, guaranteeing a balanced geographical coverage;\n- offer services that enhance networking, cross fertilization and knowledge exchange between the different AKIS actors [3] , to stimulate dialogue on innovative solutions and initiatives, to build relations and support mutual learning across the EU;\n- actively involve advisors in knowledge hubs and mobilise relevant AKIS actors (including the AKIS coordination bodies) and actions at European/ national/regional levels to support the implementation of the knowledge and solutions in practice across the EU;\n- include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with, ensure complementarities, avoid duplication of efforts and use efficiently the outputs and activities of the relevant past, existing and future AKIS projects [4] .\n- establish strong collaborations with national or regional authorities and ecosystems ensuring effective partnerships that support Member States in the training of advisors and enable them to provide practical guidance tailored to diverse contexts, including accessing finance;\n- develop a long-term plan to update and maintain the knowledge hub and its outputs beyond the project duration. Ensure that all resources are created with interoperability, adaptability and transferability in mind to facilitate their continued use and transfer/integration across diverse platforms and stakeholders.\nProposals should either address the thematic Area A: Enhancing competitiveness of protein crops, or Area B: Sustainable water management under climate change. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the proposal. Within the frame of each of the broad thematic area, applicants should select specific topics in a bottom-up way in order to respond to the most urgent need(s) from practice and explain the theme’s relevance in relation to end-users’ need(s), clarifying the added-value of the proposal and how it avoids duplication with the ongoing or completed thematic networks and projects [5] .\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a balanced consortium of relevant actors with complementary knowledge, actively involving advisors and end-users to identify the most urgent practical needs and plan and execute the main tasks of the knowledge hub.

By engaging in on-farm demonstrations, farmers are better positioned to assess the applicability of innovative practices or tools. Complementing on-farm demonstrations with comprehensive cost-benefit analyses further empowers farmers, allowing them to quantitively evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the adoption of new solutions/practices. This approach should not only promote informed decision-making but also accelerate the uptake and integration of innovative practices across the agricultural sector. Proposals should either address Area A: Crop production systems, or Area B: Livestock and mixed production systems. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the proposal.\nProposals should:\n- develop objective benchmarking criteria to select agricultural innovations, considering factors such as their impact, ease of implementation, scalability and applicability across different agricultural systems;\n- develop and apply a standardised methodology to assess the economic, environmental (including biodiversity effects), and social impacts of adopting these innovations, with focus on the analysis of the costs and benefits for the practitioners;\n- screen and select promising practice-oriented innovative solutions developed by research and innovation projects in the area of agriculture to be tested on-farm and by farmers, on the basis of the objective benchmarking criteria;\n- test, validate and showcase the innovative solutions in real conditions directly on- farms across different geographic realities in real conditions, and thoroughly analyse their costs and benefits for the practitioners. It is essential that proposals ensure complementarity and cooperation with existing and future peer-to-peer and on-farm demo activities in their planning and avoid overlaps and repetitions, ensuring geographical coverage of the EU;\n- develop and widely share learning materials and courses, and incentivise peer-to-peer learning by organising, e.g., cross-border field visits and farmer-centred webinars presenting the most effective innovative solutions to farmers and advisors.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating advisors, farmers and/or foresters and/or rural actors. To effectively support the transition of innovations into the market, the participation of startups and SMEs is strongly encouraged.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate innovative measures. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Particular efforts [1] in outreach and communication should be made by the project to help publicise these calls to the stakeholder targeted as beneficiaries of the support.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the cross-cutting objective of the common agricultural policy (CAP) to enhance knowledge flows and the adoption of innovation among AKIS [2] actors, in particular advisory services and end-users [3] .\n[1] activities that go beyond the minimum requirements set out in General Annex B.\n[2] AKIS is defined in Article 3(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115.\n[3] An “(end-)user” of R&I result(s) is a person who is him/herself putting the results into practice (i.e. practitioner); depending on the area selected, end-users could be farmers and/or other rural actors, or both of them.",

      "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European partnership of Agriculture of Data identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also been implementing the partnership through a co-funded call launched in year 2024 and a number of internal activities, including research projects, based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01. In this context, the current consortium has unique expertise in relation to the objectives of the partnership, the activities to be implemented in particular through financial support to third parties and internal activities clearly required/envisioned pursuant to the initial proposal/partnership. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe partnership should seek to include additional partners, in particular from Member States and Associated countries not yet in the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01 and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement. Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of the existing topic and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions.\nThe proposal submitted to this call should align with the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda. Through its activities, the partnership should deliver and give rise to ready-to-use tools, solutions and innovations, seek uptake of results by farmers/agricultural producers, advisors, policy-makers, public administrations and all relevant stakeholders, and provide science-based policy advisory activities. The proposal should focus on additional priority activities and when duly justified, on continuation of on-going activities.\nThe partnership should create an “umbrella effect” through taking stock, linking and, assessing Research and Innovation (R&I) initiatives and use cases. It should leverage on nationally funded research activities to create critical mass and synergies across borders and also support defragmentation of the European data landscape. It should also pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to organising and implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties, for which it should factor ample time to run and report on the co-funded projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] in the environment, food and digital domains.\nSpecific additional activities to enhance the partnership’s collaborations at international level, should also be described.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ .",

      "scope": "Proposals should:\n- better understand, project and reduce uncertainties linked to the impacts, timing and consequences of an ice-free Arctic. This includes the underlying systems (such as ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere) and processes, strengthening research on key or main drivers of internal variability and their interconnectedness to the climate system, under multi and cumulative and cascading impacts of anthropogenic activities (resource extraction, climate change, shipping and industrial activities, pollution, introduction of NIS, etc.), abrupt, irreversible change/tipping elements and thresholds, including their reversibility. In particular, understanding the nuances of the impacts of occasional daily ice-free conditions, versus frequent monthly ice-free conditions, versus ice-free conditions that occur for several months a year, is needed to assess the true impact of a new seasonal Arctic sea ice regime in a warming world, in particular in and for Europe.\n- enhance regional models representing integrated key physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes, especially to capture processes in the changing sea-ice regimes (ecological and political) and the impacts of extremes, building on and further developing the existing IPCC class climate models and making use of new technologies for sustained monitoring of key climate indicators / shared Arctic variables and machine learning techniques for the advanced interpretation of these data.\n- identify transformative pathways and key leverage points for sustainable mitigation and anticipatory adaptation approaches. This could include and are not limited to looking into aspects of: community resilience and health, particularly Indigenous populations, in adapting to cultural, political, economic and environmental changes, including addressing food security, health impacts, and preserving cultural practices; explore novel economic opportunities and challenges, evaluating the potential for shorter and new shipping routes and other economic opportunities, explore sustainable energy solutions for Arctic communities, including wind, solar, and geothermal energy potential, resource exploration, and sustainable economic development while ensuring environmental protection; explore elements of risk management and hazard mitigation preparing for increased coastal erosion, increased extreme weather events, and the impacts of thawing permafrost on infrastructures, greenhouse emissions, and increased risks of natural and anthropogenic hazards; develop strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sequestration in Arctic ecosystems (bearing in mind the precautionary principle/approach, and the efficiency and effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions); improve projections for Arctic’s “Last Ice Area” (LIA) — a vital habitat for ice-dependent species — and critical for Arctic habitats , and inform conservation policies and measures; explore the power of enhancing cooperation among Arctic nations and global partners to share data, resources, and expertise and identify issues of geopolitical and strategic nature and assess the implications of a navigable Arctic for shipping and other blue economy or coastal-linked activities, resource extraction, and international relations, strongly considering sustainability and the precautionary principle/approach.\nActions should conduct trans- and multi-disciplinary research, include aspects of gender, SSH, equality and inclusion, and intergenerational concerns, and strengthen the inclusion of different knowledge systems (Indigenous Knowledge, Local Knowledge and Science) in broadening our understanding the multifaceted governance, sustainable development and international politics of an ice-free Arctic. International cooperation is strongly encouraged, especially with the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) partner countries [1] . A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under Polhavet 2050 – Arctic Ocean 2050. The actions should build on existing observing platforms and initiatives, and/or contribute to the evolution of the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and Destination Earth. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus and EMODnet). Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThis topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination, with relevant ESA Polar Science Cluster projects, including utilising novel satellite Earth Observation datasets and joint research actions. Furthermore, this topic is supporting the European polar science coordination efforts, including synergies with the objectives of the European Polar Coordination Office (EPCO) and through contributing to the implementation of its work plan. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] , as well as related projects in the environment domain.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The JRC may contribute with its expertise related to developing new methods to forecast air pollution and to estimate methane emissions from thawing permafrost.\n[1] Home - All Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

      "scope": "The 2020 and 2025 Strategic Foresight Reports [1] put forward resilience as a compass for EU policies. Resilience is defined as the ability not only to withstand and cope with challenges but also to undergo transitions, in a sustainable, fair, and democratic manner. Adopting a transformative, proactive and forward-looking approach to resilience is needed for the EU to thrive in turbulent times, anticipate new challenges and create a safe space for citizens and businesses. Against this background, proposals should target several systemic risks and crises (e.g., sanitary, environmental, economic, geopolitical, biodiversity, demographic, technological) that are causing, or likely to cause, significant socio-economic impacts directly or indirectly affecting European agriculture or forestry, and agri-food or forest-based supply chains, considering potential compound, cascading and amplifier effects under climate change.\nThe actions under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU Forest Strategy, the common agricultural policy, and the forthcoming European Climate Adaptation Plan.\nProposals should:\n- improve analytical capacity on: the exposure of the agricultural or forestry sectors and of agri-food or forest-based supply chains and their agents, including consumers, to (interacting) systemic risks and crises, including compound, cascading and amplifier effects related to climate change and trade disruptions; the assessment and measurement of the propagation of shocks and short-, medium- and long-term impacts (social, economic, environmental including biodiversity) of those (interacting) systemic risks and crises on the agricultural or forestry sectors and on agri-food or forest-based supply chains and their agents, at different scales (local to global) and considering the vulnerability of different groups (e.g. age, gender or other social factors). Proposals should take into account the specificities of different types of supply chains, e.g., in terms of length, organisation, critical dependencies, considering also the role of ecosystem services and, where relevant, intergenerational time scales;\n- explore a range of effective socio-economic and technological (e.g., advanced digital technologies) options and identify leverage points to further develop integrated prevention, preparedness, management, adaptation and transformation strategies and pathways that encompass different temporal (short to long term) and spatial (global to local) scales to improve the resilience at each critical stage of the agri-food or forest-based supply chains;\n- analyse those options with regard to societal and institutional preconditions, the costs and benefits, at different levels, of action versus non-action, as well as coherence, synergies and trade-offs with competitiveness, health and sustainability objectives.\nProposals should either address Area A: Agriculture and agri-food supply chains, or Area B: Forestry and forest-based supply chains. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the application.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. They should also ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects, including from the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Soil, and ensure synergies with other relevant EU initiatives and processes (e.g., Resilience Dashboards [2] ).\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.). Proposals selected in Area A are also expected to collaborate with the projects selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-03-GOVERNANCE-01: Strengthening the resilience of European farmers through improved capacity in coping with risks and crises.\nProposals should support collaborative and interdisciplinary work, involving the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines in combination with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [3] in the environmental, biological and food domains.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The role of the JRC would be to contribute with knowledge and expertise on concurrent and recurrent climate hazards (especially drought and heatwaves) and their amplifying effects in terms of impacts in the agricultural and forestry sectors, and to support exploration of high-impact low-probability events, including those linked to crossing tipping points.\n[1] 2020 Strategic Foresight Report - European Commission\n2025 Strategic Foresight Report - European Commission\n[2] Resilience Dashboards - European Commission\n[3] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

By 2026, the Commission will have adopted the first EU certification methodologies for different carbon farming activities through delegated acts, will have issued implementing acts with certification rules, and will have started the process of recognising certification schemes entitled to apply CRCF rules. With implementation of CRCF expected to start in 2027, this topic should serve to develop innovations and knowledge facilitating and enhancing its implementation on the ground.\nProposals should:\n- develop innovations to facilitate carbon farming certification, particularly by integrating advanced technologies (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, Earth observation, IoT) and by enhancing cooperation among holders of relevant knowledge and data (e.g., networks of benchmark sites, ring tests among soil laboratories, interoperability of relevant datasets), in order to harmonise data collection and verification and to minimise administrative burden for operators;\n- maintain open-access lists of models, sampling protocols, datasets of emission factors and other relevant data to harmonise sustainability benchmarks for carbon farming activities, enhance the robustness of company-level and national greenhouse gas inventories for the land sector and the agricultural sector, and ensure the comparability and interoperability of all CRCF uses;\n- based on experience with the implementation of the CRCF Regulation and its implementing rules during the first years after entry into force, and building on previous knowledge and tools developed by other relevant (EU-funded) projects, enhance capacity among the relevant stakeholders and facilitate the broad application of new or improved technologies, processes or services supporting the successful participation of land managers, certification schemes, and certification bodies;\n- create awareness about CRCF among all potential users, buyers, or financiers of carbon farming (e.g., companies in the bioeconomy, national and regional agriculture and environmental authorities, financial institutions), collect information about their data needs, and facilitate access to those data within the context of CRCF certification and registry;\n- systematically collect and analyse feedback and lessons learned by carbon farming actors involved in CRCF implementation, particularly regarding obstacles to implementing and scaling-up of CRCF certification;\n- identify and address – through technological, economic or social innovations – remaining obstacles for effective large-scale participation in CRCF certification, and propose potential improvements to enabling conditions, certification methodologies, verification rules, and incentive structures.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of relevant stakeholders, including potential carbon-farming practitioners (farmers, foresters and other land managers), other market participants, certification bodies and relevant public authorities.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project(s) selected under this topic and with projects under other relevant topics in Horizon Europe Work Programmes, including the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' and the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO).\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\n[1] https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en#eu-carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming-certification-crcf-regulation",

      "scope": "The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Green Deal objectives for resilient and sustainable agri-food systems, the EU climate policy, the methane strategy, the Vision for Agriculture and Food, and the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] .\nLivestock production significantly contributes to GHG emissions and resource consumption, making it essential to improve feed efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Enteric fermentation in ruminants produces substantial methane emissions, while inefficient feed conversion increases feed demand, land use, and pollution. Developing and implementing effective feed additives can lower methane production, enhance nutrient utilization, and reduce nitrogen excretion, supporting sustainable livestock farming, improved profitability for farmers, and global climate goals.\nReducing methane emissions from ruminants contributes to environmental sustainability by lowering the climate and environmental impact of livestock production, while also supporting economic sustainability for farmers through improved productivity and cost savings. Only a handful of additives have demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing methane emissions or have become commercially available. The limited availability of reliable options and the challenges posed by inconsistent efficacy and applicability across diverse production systems represent a constraint. Proposals should address various terrestrial livestock systems, from conventional to extensive systems, considering regional feeding systems. Proposals should address at least farmed large ruminants.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n- develop and test a wide range of additives that reduce emissions in operational environment (reaching TRL 7), their synergies and optimal delivery strategies for diverse terrestrial livestock systems, including extensive and grass-based systems, both under conventional and organic production. Impacts on animal health, welfare, performance, product quality, and net GHG emissions and air pollutants, and potential trade-offs among these factors should be addressed;\n- identify clear endpoints for risk assessment of feed additives to demonstrate their safety and define complementarity criteria to demonstrate their effectiveness and environmental impact, all supported by scientific evidence;\n- verify the practicalities, applicability, scalability and socio-economic-environmental impacts, including trade-offs with other environmental and social dimensions, of using feed additives across different production systems and in different feeding scenarios;\n- promote and facilitate a standardised data collection system for quality control procedures and record-keeping practices that ensures consistency across stakeholder groups and meets the requirements for accurate reporting, keeping in mind the EU [2] and EFSA regulatory framework from the inception and for feed additives;\n- identify strategies like improved distribution networks, farmer education programmes, and possible subsidies or incentives to make new innovative feed additives that reduce livestock emissions more affordable;\n- assessing consumer perception to understand attitudes towards the use of feed additives to reduce emissions in livestock production and identify key factors influencing their decisions.\nThe JRC participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the integrated agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP), sharing information, and contributing to dissemination of results.\nTo respect the ‘Do-No-Significant-Harm' (DNSH) principle, proposals need to properly address and exclude any potential risk of feed additives on the environment, animal or human health.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in the livestock sectors, including farmers, advisors, private sector/industry (e.g., processors, feed manufacturers), policy-makers, consumers, etc.\nProposals should capitalise on research findings and tools, included those developed under previous and ongoing relevant research projects. Proposals should interact with relevant structures or organizations at European level and beyond such as FAO, Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP, FAO) [3] , Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases [4] .\nTo better address the requirements of the topic, international cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] Regulation (EC) 1831/2003 , Regulation (EC) 767/2009\n[3] https://www.fao.org/partnerships/leap/en/\n[4] https://globalresearchalliance.org/research/livestock/networks/",

      "scope": "The Vision for Agriculture and Food recognises organic farming as an approach with potential to ensure an attractive and predictable agri-food sector, while at the same time delivering several ecosystem services beneficial for the environment, climate and biodiversity. There is a dual need to, on one hand, better understand the contribution of organic farming and of the organic sector as a whole to the three dimensions of sustainability, and on the other, to improve methods for data collection in the organic sector, in a way that reduces administrative burden on farmers and on other operators. There is potential for both needs to be addressed in combination, and a role for research and innovation to support in achieving this objective.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n- undertake an exhaustive mapping of existing tools, platforms and methods at EU, national and local levels, that allow for the collection of relevant data on organic production to comply with the various reporting requirements of the sector, including under the Common Agricultural Policy and under the EU organic certification. This exercise should include a mapping of the actors involved in the collection of data, as well as an analysis of cost-effectiveness, best practices and challenges faced. It should also include an assessment of the potential of existing tools to reduce administrative burden on organic farmers and on other operators of the organic value chain, as well as to streamline data exchange with relevant actors, including certification bodies and supply chain actors;\n- facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices on data collection and reporting on organic production across the EU. Identify concrete opportunities for the cross-fertilisation and transfer of solutions among countries/regions;\n- assess the need, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of leveraging existing data collected by organic certification bodies in a way that it can simultaneously be used to assess the contribution of organic production to the three axes of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). This should include an analysis of existing standards for the interoperability of agricultural digital systems, and identification of opportunities and challenges;\n- develop recommendations, including in relation to governance, for the effective use of current tools for data collection, considering differences across the EU Member States;\n- organise and implement training activities targeted to organic farmers and other operators of the organic value chains, to build their capacities to collect relevant data to comply with the reporting obligations on organic production. This should include networking activities to foster cooperation among actors in the organic agri-food supply chains with a view to increasing overall efficiency of the organic sector for data collection.\nProposals should address all EU Member States. Proposals under this topic should support the implementation of the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] and of the EU regulatory framework for organic farming, and contribute to the objectives of the Vision for Agriculture and Food [2] , the Common Agricultural Policy, and the EU’s biodiversity, zero pollution and climate policies.\nBoth crop and livestock production systems under organic production are in scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in the organic sector, and including a range of actors to ensure that different sources of knowledge and perspectives are brought together. The needs and expertise of all relevant actors, including certification bodies, should be duly considered in the activities. Proposals should capitalise on existing knowledge and tools, such as the Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN) [3] . Proposals should build on the results of relevant past/ongoing EU-funded R&I projects relevant for the organic farming sector, as well as of other relevant related work/studies, and on any relevant activities funded under the Digital Europe Programme. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other relevant ongoing and upcoming EU-funded R&I projects and initiatives, including the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ and the project that may follow from the topic “HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data”.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0075\n[3] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/farm-structures-and-economics/fsdn_en",

By reducing dependency on a single farmed crop, farmers can strengthen their competitiveness in an ever-changing agricultural landscape. The temporal and spatial diversification of crops through e.g. rotation and associations, are drivers for low-input, resource-efficient farming systems that can fulfil the need to produce food, feed, industrial products (e.g. bioenergy, biomaterials, biochemicals) and other ecosystems services. These diversified and low-input farming systems will emerge if clear benefits to farmers and society are demonstrated and if the downstream value chains are properly organized.\nProposals should:\n- develop, test and showcase innovative solutions as well as business and cooperation models with a focus on activities addressing the challenges to support farmers in diversifying their crop production, enhancing profitability, resilience and sustainability;\n- assess the viability and impact of the practical implementation of the proposed innovations on the overall sustainability of farmers activities and businesses (economic, social and environmental). The climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection and restoration potential of the proposed innovations should be analysed;\n- describe an exploitation pathway tailor-made for the developed innovations through the different necessary steps (e.g. market research, regulatory approvals and licensing, IP management etc.) in order to accelerate exploitation of the results;\n- provide support to farmers to transition to crop diversification, addressing the specific challenges of the sector and designing strategies to overcome them. Create diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, such as audiovisuals, brochures, presentations, that showcase innovations in a creative way, incorporating artistic elements for engaging storytelling.\nActivities must fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach and allow for adequate involvement of SMEs, technology developers, farmers and consumers. The involvement of farmers SMEs is crucial and should be fostered through targeted calls and financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs developing and testing the proposed innovative solutions. Proposals should address various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming.\nProposals should allocate adequate resources to collaborate with topic projects funded under other topics in this work programme, in particular \"HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-03. Proposals should clearly explain how they will build on and not duplicate past and ongoing EU-funded R&I activities, including relevant projects and activities funded under the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ and the EU Mission Soil.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] and the Common Agricultural Policy.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

      "scope": "Small-scale aquatic food production includes small-scale fisheries, recreational fisheries and aquaculture farms that are classified as SMEs. In 2021, small-scale fisheries contributed to 49% of employment in EU fisheries. Together with other maritime activities, small-scale fisheries play a vital role in local economies, particularly in the Mediterranean, where over half of the sector is concentrated. Recreational fisheries are non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport. While the marketing or sale of catches from recreational fisheries is prohibited, if properly monitored and managed they can contribute to conservation efforts and support community development. According to the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, the aquaculture sector in the EU consists primarily of small and family-owned enterprises- especially in the case of mollusk farms. However, small-scale actors often face difficulties in developing and adopting innovative technologies.\nSelected proposals should advance knowledge and develop tools, including Nature-based Solutions, for managing and further developing small-scale aquatic food production. They should include, where relevant, both aspects of natural science and technical know-how to improve small-scale aquatic food production as well as issues related to social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. In the frame of SSH, cultural elements such as local traditions related to aquatic food production and consumption could be included. The scope of the topic includes fisheries and aquaculture activities taking place in fresh, brackish and marine waters, such as small-scale fisheries, small-scale mollusk, seaweed and fish farms, recreational fisheries, urban aquaculture and aquaponics.\nSelected proposals should develop innovative methodologies to assess environmental and socio-economic contributions of relevant small-scale actors to the prosperity of local communities within the broader aquatic food system, taking into account a gender sensitive approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations. This could, for example, include diverse data sources (e.g. citizen science, social media) and advance data processing, validation, and interoperability solutions using for example AI, machine learning, and big data analytics to provide actionable insights.\nThe effects of climate change on small-scale aquatic food production should be addressed as well as the potential contribution of small-scale aquatic food production to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, the potential for environmental services provision and of improvements of ecological footprint should be explored. Aquatic animal welfare issues should be considered, where relevant.\nSelected proposals should include from their design throughout their development and implementation relevant stakeholders and end-users and produce outputs that can be readily applicable by them. Special attention should be given to knowledge transfer, training, and capacity-building activities to ensure the practical implementation of research findings and innovations by small-scale actors and policymakers.",

      "scope": "Through food and beverages, the population is exposed to an immense variety of chemicals (as contaminants and as ingredients). The “foodome” is the complete set of compounds present in a food sample at a given time; it includes both endogenous biomolecules (produced through a species' metabolic processes) and exogenous compounds (natural and synthetic substances from production, processing, handling, and packaging). The current knowledge is largely confined to a narrow set of approximately 150 food components catalogued by traditional databases. These components represent only a very small fraction of the total chemical complexity present in foods, while thousands (>100,000) of compounds and contaminants remain largely unquantified and underexplored. Understanding this “nutrient dark matter” would require identifying, cataloguing and quantifying the full spectrum of substances present in our food and present in accessible, AI-ready databases. The need for such information is today a bottleneck to make the nutrition field predictive and data driven, and has the potential to make food processing more efficient in bringing new foods items on the market. Efforts to create such datasets are underway but owing to the quantity of samples (hundreds of thousands of compounds across thousands of foods), such databases often rely on high-throughput experimental methods which do not allow a precise characterisation of the molecules identified.\nProposals should address the following activities:\n- develop and test validated AI algorithms capable of interpreting and annotating high-throughput foodomics data, for instance from untargeted mass-spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance;\n- the AI algorithms should be capable to predict or infer the presence and concentration of compounds based on (incomplete) foodomics data via innovative approaches, for instance by considering phylogenic relationships between species. Moreover, this should help identify analytical methods and potential food safety hazards based on their similarity to known compounds;\n- develop a European research and innovation network between Member States and Associated Countries in food exposome research to support the development, standardization, valorisation and dissemination of the AI results and considering existing initiatives such as the Centre for Excellence in the Periodic Table of Food Initiative from Wageningen University.\nThe multi-actor approach is encouraged. Proposals should include industry in the consortia and academia, startups, SMEs and international initiatives. Collaboration with international partners is encouraged as well as with existing private companies in the EU/Associated countries.",

Proposals should address unmet research needs, complementing previous Horizon Europe calls.\nIn that sense, proposals should consider, build on – if appropriate – while not duplicating, previous research, including but not limited to, SSH disciplines and/or research by other Horizon Europe projects, in particular in the context of this destination. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.\nGiven the multifaceted character of the challenges confronted by democracies, applicants should ensure effective interdisciplinary collaborations by building consortia with the participation of all relevant disciplines, depending of course on the nature of the selected democratic challenge and research angle.\nApplicants are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches, including also by considering alternative and complementary models for democratic participation and engagement, facilitating the development and potential uptake of solutions. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant democracy practitioners and policymakers, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term contributions to the expected outcomes, performed by the democracy practitioners and policy-makers. Proposals should directly engage citizens, as well as civil society organisations, to enable broader public debate and explore uptake of democratic innovations and better anticipate potential risks.\nProposals are encouraged to collaborate with the JRC Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy, particularly with respect to demonstrating how structured opportunities for citizen participation strengthen inclusiveness and fairness of democratic institutions and practices, and foster evolution in democratic public spaces.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en?filename=Political%20Guidelines%202024-2029_EN.pdf\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250\n[3] https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6453\n[4] For the roadmap for women’s rights, see the announcement of its adoption with links to the communication and its annex: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_681\n[5] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021DC0101\n[6] https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities",

      "scope": "Dementia is a progressive neurological disease. The number of people with dementia will double by 2050 in the European Union, from 10 million currently. As people with dementia lose their ability to care for themselves, care is often provided by informal caregivers, which mostly include family members, and more specifically women. In fact, 71% of the estimated time devoted to unpaid care for people with dementia is devoted by women. Women, especially those in vulnerable situations such as those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, often face additional pressures in managing caregiving responsibilities, which may exacerbate pre-existing inequalities. Furthermore, the provision of informal care has a negative impact on the economic and social life of the caregiver, as the time spent on the person with dementia is time not spent in employment or with other friends and family. Additionally, informal care is unpaid and has been estimated to have negative financial consequences for the caregivers themselves and the society as a whole. Studies have also shown that people with dementia and their informal caregivers have higher rates of depression than the general population.\nWhile there is a lot of attention for clinical research, there is far less attention for the aspects surrounding the economic and social life, financial stability and the mental health of persons with dementia and informal caregivers. Many innovative solutions have been proposed, but few have been implemented on a wide scale. Social public policies with different design and funding that take into account the substitution and complementarities between formal and informal caregivers have been implemented to reduce the burden of the informal caregivers. What is needed, are systemic interventions focussed on improving these aspects for patients and informal caregivers and addressing the gendered nature of caregiving.\nPriority should be given to scaling up and contextualising interventions that have already shown promise or effectiveness at smaller scale, rather than developing entirely new or untested solutions. Applicants should provide a robust methodological framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions. Proposals should also assess the economic feasibility and sustainability of the interventions, including cost-effectiveness and potential integration into existing health and social care systems or policy frameworks. Proposals can focus on groups in vulnerable situations (e.g. migrants, lower socio-economic populations, people with disabilities) for gender-responsive and inclusive interventions. Social inequality analyses are therefore also recommended. Community based models (e.g. dementia-friendly cities, peer-support groups) can be included, as well as analyses of the quality of residence of people with dementia. Proposals are encouraged to include technology and digital tools in the scope of their work.\nConsidering the already high burden of dementia, interventions should be implemented in at least four Member States or Associated Countries. Considering the focus, it is of the upmost importance that informal caregivers are involved in the research throughout (in the design and implementation) to ensure that interventions are tailored to the real needs of caregivers and the individuals they care for.\nProposals should outline clear, evidence-based strategies for tailoring, deploying, and assessing these interventions at individual, family, community, and societal levels, while addressing the specific needs of different caregiver demographics.",

      "scope": "The topic aims to optimise the efficiency of materials, water and energy use by recycling and upcycling of side streams from production and end-of-use waste, to become more competitive, safe and sustainable. Material production becomes less dependent on imports and / or use of non-renewable materials by improving recovery along the value chain, developing and upscaling low-CO2 processes to recover materials, including to replace current efficient but CO2-intensive recycling.\nThe continuity and high resource demand for materials and energy of industrial processes need dependable availability of resources. The attainment of this target requires moving away from primary, often expensive, and rare resources, by the re-integration and valorisation of secondary resources (end-of-use waste) and industrial side-streams into the process industries as feedstock. Priority should be given to streams that contain critical and insufficiently available raw materials, and to streams with a large carbon footprint or a large required energy input for their production.\nThe development of technologies should encompass the entire value chain from the collection, dismantling, sorting and separation of waste to the processing of the streams and the production of new high-quality materials. The demonstration of the innovative, efficient, and economically viable technologies is required, considering a scale and conditions that can give reliable indications on the real-world economic potential. Minimizing the intake of energy and water should be considered.\nProposals under this topic are expected to address at least 3 of the following points:\n- Increase the share of sustainable feed streams of the process industries from end-of-use waste and/or foster circular material flows in house and/or across sites of iron-containing and other residuals / waste / by-products, avoiding incineration or disposal, including the development / upscaling of low CO2 processes with reduced negative impact on air quality;\n- Improve product designs including by-products for easier re-cycling and upcycling;\n- Enhance existing technologies for a more efficient residual / waste / by-products collection, sorting, classification, characterisation, treatment, processing and re-use. This can include development / improvement of end-of-life recycling processes targeting waste, scrap, dust and sludges for possible use for high-performance high-reliability products;\n- Recover relevant secondary raw materials, including critical ones, and target maximum process efficiency;\n- Reduce the usage of scarce and critical raw materials in the production processes, while at the same time preserving ecosystem and reducing pressures on biodiversity that would be caused by extraction;\n- Reduce the number of manufacturing stages by shortening of production processes, leading to a reduction in the energy consumption; and/or consider approaches/technologies for optimising efficiency in terms of water use.\n- Understand the effect of specific contaminants on the properties of materials produced from secondary feedstock and develop technologies for their removal if needed, also in view of the need for pre-treatment and secondary manufacturing steps.\n- Where relevant, include analytical techniques for micro- and/or nano-characterisation of materials to gain the necessary knowledge to influence processes and allow dedicated modelling.\nShowcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale. Digitalisation should be included when effective, but it must not be targeted independently from the development and validation of the necessary process technologies.\nThe re-integration of side streams in the production cycle can take place within one sector or across sectors (industrial symbiosis). Impacts of regulations must be considered and proposals for their modification and/or enhancement should be suggested where required.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Processes4Planet and Clean Steel.\n[1] Environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings: Council and Parliament reach agreement - Consilium",

The scope includes necessary developments of related processes and technologies to ensure integration in industrial manufacturing facilitating uptake of the developed solutions. Proposals should also develop circular business models considering the cost of changes needed along the life cycle of these new materials to facilitate their uptake.\nThe scope covers the full innovation cycle from the design for circularity and functional integration (new materials designs), development and scaleup (including scalable recovery, recycling and valorisation at end of life), to demonstration of industrial uptake and integration into products. The transformative potential of the developed solutions is to be showcased by demonstrators and industrial use cases. Projects should also explore possibilities to transfer developed solutions to other applications or sectors.\nThe SSbD framework [1] should guide the innovation process towards safer and more sustainable chemicals and advanced materials.

The new alternatives to be developed should meet the technical functions required in the specific applications while aligning their innovation process decision making with such framework.\nBest use of digital tools and FAIR data, including AI and data-driven approaches throughout the innovation process should support the circular transition for industry and circular product design. This includes sharing FAIR and interoperable data and tools across supply networks and value chains, to foster circularity, including data needed for materials and component development, production and circular product design. Proposals should adhere to the FAIR data principles and adopt wherever relevant, data standards and data sharing/access good practices.\nThe approach should foster collaboration among stakeholders along the innovation chain and industrial value networks to accelerate the development and adoption of new circular solutions.\nProjects should build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, in particular with the Materials Commons for Europe.\nProposals should support strategic value chains in the fields of mobility and medical devices.

These workflows and tools may include the use of artificial intelligence as well as self-driving labs and their interconnection and design of experiment/design of simulation methods. They should also drive innovation in risk assessment, new test methods and support and facilitate the operationalisation and use of the SSbD framework [1] . Projects should include demonstrators which help to validate the materials development in realistic conditions.\nBy doing so, new innovative advanced materials (IAMs) with superior or novel functionalities and alternatives to substances of concern should be developed more rapidly in Europe. In addition, digital feedback loops ranging from requirements and information from production processes and scale-up, to manufacturing and integration into products, should be developed to accelerate market uptake. Innovative digital tools to speed up risk assessment and thereby market access of chemicals and advanced materials may also be addressed.\nInteroperable workflows based on shared standards and dedicated ontologies, in particular through collaboration with the Materials Commons for Europe, should help to reduce the cost of the digital transition for industry with respect to circularity and safe and sustainable by design, e.g. by reducing the risk for adopters and vendors, and through modular tools that can be extended to new application domains without a major redesign. Tools should foster workflows in that ensure high-quality, well-structured and documented primary FAIR data and FAIR digital tools and workflows, enabling the re-use and/or streamlining of large data sets, facilitating academic and industrial collaborations and integrating AI and other digital technologies. Synergies with the SSbD toolboxes can also be foreseen including the adaptation and validation [2] of the test methods for advanced materials. Proposals could also facilitate the generation of relevant data and where relevant sharing of data with the Common Data Platform for Chemicals. Where relevant, proposals should actively contribute to and cooperate with the EU Innovation and Substitution Hub(s). Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to the proposed activities.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.\nProposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of added value to the operationalisation of the SSbD framework.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU).\n[1] See documents defining the SSbD framework on: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\n[2] In this context, validation refers to the requirement that test methods included in any SSbD toolbox must be sufficiently reliable and robust for innovators to use them.",

Proposals should aim to provide travel grants strengthening collaboration in relevant ongoing research activities in Europe on the topic of advanced materials with applications to either mobility, energy, construction, electronics or medical devices. Proposals should ensure a wide geographical coverage of the grants in Member States and Associated Countries.

This involves optimising the integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion processes.\n- Demonstrate processes that minimize energy consumption during the entire conversion process, leveraging advances in process integration that can shift equilibria and the use of renewable electricity and available heat sources.\n- Contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions by enabling the sustainable use of CO2, supporting circular economy principles through the valorisation of CO2, possibly aligned with CCS.",
      "scope": "There are only a few products that can be competitively produced from CO2. Increased opportunities for CCU from process industry emissions require the development of a larger portfolio of potential CO2-derived products. The higher cost of CO2-based products compared to conventional production routes is mostly driven by the high energy demand arising from the thermodynamic constraints of CO2. The smart integration of CO2 capture, purification and conversion can enable process optimisation with reduced energy consumption as well as reduced capital expenditure. Additionally, innovative processes can overcome the inherent equilibrium limitations of CCU production. The development of new integrated processes can be an opportunity to optimise the use of electricity, make use of available heat sources and relevant infrastructures and thus accelerate the development of CO2 valorisation.\nProposals under this topic are expected to address several of the following points:\n- Develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for the smart integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion, focusing on reducing energy demand, capital expenditure and possible integration with CCS infrastructure requirements.\n- Incorporate renewable energy sources (including the fluctuation of energy availability) and innovative energy management strategies to enhance the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the CO2 valorisation processes.\n- Identify and integrate available heat sources and existing infrastructures to enhance process efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n- Address the constraints related to CO2 conversion processes, employing innovative approaches to maximize yield and process efficiency, for example by overcoming low equilibrium yields.\n- Conduct comprehensive lifecycle and economic assessments to ensure that the proposed solutions are viable, sustainable, and economically attractive.\nConversion of CO2 to methanol and fuels is considered outside the scope of this topic.\nShowcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale.\nThe inclusion of a GHG avoidance methodology [1] is recommended and should provide detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. Proposals should consider representative real industrial sites demonstrating the solutions at least in open-loop computations. This should be done in parallel to the actual operation of the plants with validation of the benefits by simulations with accurate models. Experiments involving real industrial sites are encouraged. Societal- and environmental impact as well as implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European partnership Processes4Planet.\n[1] That could follow Innovation Fund methodology: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf",

As not all cost and quality challenges may be immediately overcome by technological innovation, accompanying business models and systems approaches are needed to enable equitable cost and risk sharing among all involved stakeholders in the textile value chain.\nAttributes such as recyclability, recycled material content, and resource efficiency as well as reduced carbon and environmental footprint are expected to be part of the textile-specific requirements under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation.\nProposals should specifically address:\n- Innovative processing technologies to facilitate the efficient use of recycled, regenerated and bio-based fibres as well as sustainable processing and functionalising chemicals across all major stages of the textile manufacturing value chain, such as spinning, weaving, knitting, dyeing or finishing;\n- Quantification of biodiversity outcomes associated to new processes by using existing Monitoring, Reporting and Validation (MRV) methodologies, adapting and testing them if needed;\n- Characterisation, quality assurance and mitigation strategies for the most common processing and functionality challenges and limitations of the sustainable materials and chemicals targeted;\n- Development of best practices and training materials targeted at designers, manufacturers, brands, end of life managers and end users, working with the targeted materials and chemicals;\n- Strategies and tools to practically implement collective risk sharing and smart scaling approaches.\nProposals should actively involve suppliers of renewable materials and sustainable chemicals, brands, commercial end users and developers/manufacturers of relevant processing technology and industrial partners with the capacity to commercially scale up production with the targeted materials and chemicals. The involvement of partners beyond the manufacturing supply chain, such as product designers, brands, commercial end users and end of life managers including collectors, sorters, recyclers and remanufacturers is particularly encouraged. Proposals should carry out research and innovation to develop missing elements and achieve the necessary integration, including economic viability. Hence, synergies with, or using results from, other projects may be appropriate. The mere integration of existing technologies or processes is outside the scope of this topic .\nProposals should provide between 10% and 25% of the EU contribution through financial support to third parties (FSTP), in order to maximise the number of SMEs involved in small-scale innovation projects. FSTP funding can be provided only to SME participants, while the active participation of larger companies in such innovation projects in encouraged.

Where relevant, any solution proposed for the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials should also include the appropriate management of the hazardous substances removed.\nActions should develop intelligent and innovative production systems which better utilise natural resources by minimising losses during waste-rock separation in an optimised and energy-efficient process and by minimising use of water.\nRecycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this topic.\nActions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.\nActions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant. The action should also include the analysis of financial opportunities ensuring the market exploitation and replication of the circular business model behind the developed solutions as new processes, products and/or services. The industry based in the EU, and users of recovered secondary raw materials should assume prominent role in the proposed actions, supported by adequate allocation of resources.\nProposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. For TRLs 6-7, a credible strategy to achieve full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the commitments of the leading partners after the end of the project.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged with countries with which the EU has signed Strategic Partnerships on raw materials, especially with Ukraine.

It should build on existing initiatives with already developed single access points to a comprehensive set of facilities and services in a selected technology area, like for example Open Innovation Test Beds or other integrated networks, that allow for a quick deployment of a common access scheme.\nThe action should include setting-up a pilot centrally managed and funded access programme, allowing companies quick access to the needed services, with simplified and standardised access conditions applicable across the EU, to be coordinated and in line with the work on the envisaged European Charter of access for industrial users to research and technology infrastructures. While the focus shall be the provision of access and support services to companies, the action can also include enhancing the accessibility and usability of technology infrastructure services to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of users.\nThe action should aim at significant broadening of the user base of the technology infrastructures to address the needs of startups and scaleups that do not have access to such facilities in their local ecosystems. To this end, proposals should include the development and implementation of activities to increase the visibility and promote and demonstrate the uptake of technology infrastructures services provided to users across the EU.\nFurthermore, proposals should aim to enhance transnational and multisite collaboration among Technology Infrastructures fostering the building of technology infrastructures ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, and best practices in management, service offer, staff exchange and networking.

      "scope": "Drastically improved AI methods and technologies hold transformative potential for the process industries, enabling advancements in process design, operational efficiency, and faster innovation across the entire lifecycle of plants and products. By using different AI approaches such as multimodal generative AI, foundation models, and agentic AI, the industry can move beyond conventional AI applications as e.g. predictive maintenance and quality control toward more intelligent, adaptive, and creative solutions.\nAI-based solutions can deliver value at every stage of the process lifecycle. In design and engineering, they can enable new innovations and accelerate the development process. During operations, AI technologies can be employed to optimize processes, enhance reproducibility, adapt to changing conditions, and provide new forms of support for the workforce and enable autonomous operation. In value chains, AI can help to adapt faster and detect changing customer needs. These capabilities support faster innovation and strengthen competitiveness in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape. However, realizing this potential requires careful consideration of risks related to reliability, security, and trust, ensuring that AI solutions are effective, safe, and responsible.\nProposals should produce dedicated innovative AI-based solutions for the process industry for one of the following scopes:\n- More effective and faster development of new materials and processes\n- Competitive and sustainable production, reducing the negative environmental impact of industry\n- Reduction of risks for the health of the workforce and for the environment and making workplaces in the process industries more attractive.\nIn the projects, user acceptance and training of the users as well as integration into the OT/IT landscape of the companies should be taken into account, e.g. through active engagement in design, development and integration of systems and processes.\nThis topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Processes4Planet and AI, Data and Robotics.",

Creation of a comprehensive framework for general purpose and flexible robotics skills development with industry-relevant challenges, evaluation metrics and success criteria.\n- Facilitation of widespread deployment of robotics in manufacturing especially SMEs, through modular, adaptable, and reconfigurable solutions built on robotics foundation models, to meet evolving production needs",
      "scope": "The proposed project aims to significantly enhance robotics capabilities in manufacturing by developing advanced robotics skills (for example, task and environment aware autonomous pick and place with high precision and speed, human-robot collaboration, etc).\nBy leveraging the use of next-generation AI, including generative AI, to enable robots to better adapt to real-world environments and interact with human operators, and focusing on reconfigurability, the project will develop industry-agnostic solutions that can be easily adapted to different manufacturing environments.\nThe project will create a comprehensive framework for robotics skills development in manufacturing, including the initial definition of three technical challenges that must be clearly described at proposal stage, with evidence of their industrial relevance and potential impact. The detailed specification and design of these challenges may be further refined during the first phase of the project in collaboration with industry partners.\nThe project will organize a multi-stage competition for each of the three identified technical challenges. Each stage of the competition is expected to present an increased level of complexity compared to the previous one. The approach for designing the competitive process, including the use of FSTP, should aim at maximising the impact.\nOne of the key use cases for this project will be the automotive industry, which should be explicitly included in proposals either as a primary focus or as a dedicated use case, demonstrating how advanced robotics can enhance production efficiency and adaptability in this sector. Other use cases alongside the automotive one are allowed and encouraged, to demonstrate the industry-agnostic nature and the transferability of the developed solutions to different industrial contexts.\nUser-industry companies from the manufacturing sector (including automotive) should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and actively support the FSTP recipients in achieving powerful and exploitable results that benefit their industry.\nOrganization of the Challenge:\nStage 1 – Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection of the 10 highest-ranked proposals for each of the three technical robotics skills, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, research organisation or public body secondary or higher education establishment, developer of robotics solutions, or a small team of organizations.\nStage 2 – Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 will receive a EUR 200,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 3 highest-ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 – Grand Finale (competition among Stage 2 winners): The 3 best teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 will receive a EUR 1,000,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges defined for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the team winning the grand finale in maximising the impact and uptake of its solutions.\nProposals must include a draft exploitation plan outlining how the solutions developed by the FSTP recipients will be taken up, with concrete support from the user-industry partners to ensure industrial relevance and future exploitation.\nThis scheme is repeated for each of the three technical challenges.\nThe consortium will ensure high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships, and will seek to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.",

These algorithms should be integrated with advanced, high-resolution hazard models — including hydrological and hydraulic models — tailored to the specific characteristics of the local area.\n- The Local Digital Twins will enable: Flood damage models capable of calculating building-scale impacts, forming the basis for damage hotspot maps. Interactive user interfaces that allow components to be exchanged, modified, and reconfigured to estimate flood damage under various urban planning and risk management scenarios — for example, assessing the feasibility of proposed or existing constructions in flood-prone zones and recommending targeted mitigation strategies.\nThe scope of this topic includes a strong research and innovation component aimed at the prototyping, testing, and large-scale validation of tailored AI algorithms designed to model multiple disaster types, with a focus on operational deployment in real-world contexts. .It is recommended to prioritise the use of frugal (and local) AI as much as possible. This approach will both reduce greenhouse emissions -an indirect driver of climate-related disasters- and ensure that the tools remain functional in environments with limited connectivity.\nProposals should take into account the expertise of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) [1] , particularly its experience in developing global systems for disaster and risk management and analyse the potential uptake of the project outcomes by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service . In addition, proposals should align with for the 2025 Mission call on Local Digital Twin for urban planning, ensuring interoperability and complementarity with related European initiatives.\nThe project results should be modular for reuse in locations outside Europe considering constraints on deployment of AI solutions in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, the project results shall be open source as much as possible and transferable through open platforms.\n- Focus will be on open-source solutions (both software and hardware) and their integration into existing platforms (e.g. EDIC [2] ) to ensure replicability of the results and portability in different areas.\n- The proposal should support open-source software and open hardware design.

The aim is to deliver concrete outputs that improve the conditions for use of the supported projects through credible technical, industrialisation and financial roadmaps, validated against investor requirements (e.g. EIB, InvestEU). Activities also include analyses of investor-readiness and supply-chain sovereignty.\n- Phase 2: For further information, see the indirectly managed action “HORIZON-CL4 Quantum Top-Up to InvestEU: Grand Challenge Phase 2” in the Cluster 4 part of the Horizon Europe 2026/2027 Work Programme. This CSA is designed to allow the best possible application in Phase 2 and the current CSA results may therefore inform applications by beneficiaries to investment support managed by the EIB under InvestEU (separate procedures).\nUnder Phase 1 projects are expected to establish a comprehensive technical and financial roadmap that demonstrates the potential of the proposed Q-INS solutions, and at least deliver evidence-based design and benchmarking packages for reduced-scale systems ( such as documentation, test/benchmark reports and evidence of pre-existing or externally financed prototypes) in one of the following two categories:\n- Category 1 (cold-atoms Q-INS) : Q-INS based on cold-atom interferometry (or other technology of at least equivalent performance) featuring long-term navigation accuracy (<10 m/hour) due to reduced drift with respect to commercial Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). End-user requirements together with documented benchmark evidence from existing or externally financed prototypes will be collected for demonstrations in maritime or aviation applications.\n- Category 2 ( Chip-scale Q-INS ): Low C-SWAP Q-INS measuring acceleration, rotation rate, and/or magnetic field, aimed at the implementation of chip-scale sensors based on defect centers and vacancies in crystals or on warm atomic vapours (including nuclear magnetic resonance), for applications e.g. in small satellites, UAVs, and autonomous transport.\nProposals should target systems that are already sufficiently mature to enable credible benchmarking and industrial road-mapping. Specific expected outcomes include:\n- A detailed technical roadmap, including system architecture, integration strategy, performance milestones, risk assessments and industrialisation plan for scalable production\n- The industrialisation plan should be validated in conjunction with the EIB requirements, including commercialization timelines, and should include at least the following: Detailed Q-INS architecture based on quantum sensing techniques hybridised with classical IMUs, Compliance assessment for SWaP-C requirements, environmental resilience, and real-world integration, An assessment of dependencies on non-EU suppliers of critical components and proposal of effective mitigation measures in view of a sovereign supply chain, Potential list of end-users to capture system requirements and use-case constraints\n- A comprehensive financial roadmap and viability assessment covering business models, market analyses, commercialization pathways, revenue projections and investment criteria\n- Documented lab-validation/benchmarking of an existing or externally financed prototype (no EU funding of R&I or prototype development in this CSA), with preliminary benchmark results.\n- An application strategy identifying target sectors (maritime, aviation, space, autonomous systems) and quantifiable advantages over classical IMUs.",

      "scope": "Generative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.\nUser industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide to the competing FSTP recipients the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small team of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\n- Stage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow to select for Stage 2 the 20 highest-ranked proposals, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations led by such SME\n- Stage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 20 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\n- Stage 3– Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,000,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, an amount of EUR 5,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge.\nThe proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects [1] and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy [2] .\n[1] In particular, proposals in telecommunication should exploit potential synergies with projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08, HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-09 and HORIZON-CL4-2025-04-DATA-02; proposals in pharma/drug should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from Cluster 1 and IHI Innovative Health Initiative; proposals in the aerospace should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from the clean aviation JU and other similar projects/initiatives.\n[2] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy.",

      "expected_outcome": "While today’s AI agents still have limited capabilities, advances in model architecture, memory, reasoning, and autonomous behaviour are paving the way to unlocking their potential across economic sectors. The Apply AI Strategy [1] acknowledges this trend and the need to advance research on next-generation AI agents. Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:\n- Significant improvements in the autonomy, robustness and reliability of AI agents through advanced planning mechanisms, memory management, and reasoning capabilities.\n- Innovative multi-agent frameworks and protocols demonstrating effective decentralized coordination and collaboration among multiple AI agents beyond the capabilities of individual agents.",
      "scope": "Next-generation AI agents are autonomous systems powered by large AI language models (e.g., large language models or large multimodal models), that can plan, utilize tools and perform actions autonomously to achieve specified goals based on high-level instructions. The large AI model acts as the agent's \"brain,\" capable of interpreting instructions, generating plans, and using tools. This capability enables agents to autonomously plan and adapt behaviour in real-time to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. AI Agents hold significant promise in numerous applications areas such as data analytics and coding.\nEffective AI agents require careful design, incorporating structured planning and reasoning methods to manage complex tasks, and be equipped with appropriate validation and monitoring techniques. Multi-agent collaboration frameworks further enhance capabilities by enabling structured interactions among multiple agents.\nKey aspects in designing effective AI agents include robust planning, reasoning, and search mechanisms that allow agents to approach complex tasks by breaking them down into structured subgoals. Effective memory and state management are necessary to maintaining coherent long-term interactions, achieved through a balanced integration of short-term and external long-term memory solutions. Moreover, integrating external tools and APIs is essential for overcoming limitations in large AI models, enhancing agent performance in tasks requiring accuracy and reliability.\nPotential research areas include enhancing AI agent autonomy through advanced self-planning and self-optimization capabilities, enabling agents to improve their decision-making and strategic planning. Other research directions include innovation in memory-augmented AI agents to facilitate robust long-term reasoning and lifelong learning; developing advanced multi-agent frameworks specifically tailored for collaborative agents, including research on AI agent frameworks based on mixed AI architectures, and advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities to enable real-world applications.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.

Predictive analytics and risk-based approaches should allow tailored compliance pathways, while integration with national systems and the Single Digital Gateway should promote cross-border mutual recognition and application of the Once-Only Principle. Public administrations should be equipped with automated compliance assessment tools, real-time analytics dashboards, and interoperability frameworks to enhance and streamline regulatory oversight and cooperation. The technologies and solutions should contribute to the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency in AI-driven compliance solutions, including traceability and explainability of automated actions.\n- The solutions under Area 1 should adhere to open technical standards, ensuring scalability, inclusiveness, and co-development with private and public stakeholders. Robust cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, trust safeguards, security and privacy cryptographic protection, including via post-quantum cryptography, should be embedded, aligning with EU data protection and digital identity frameworks. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models should be harnessed, to the extent possible/reasonable, to enable data-driven feedback loops that support continuous policy learning, allowing regulators to monitor rule implementation, identify unnecessary burdens, and simplify legislation based on real-time evidence. Where appropriate, the actions under this Area should build on and integrate the privacy-enhancing (including anonymization) technologies developed under earlier topics in the Horizon Europe programme.\n- Area 2: The actions under this area should focus on the design and deployment of secure, scalable, and adaptive data management systems that automate key data processes , such as data curation, metadata tagging, ontology management and discovery, labelling, annotation, and quality control, developing and adapting appropriate AI methods and tools for these specific tasks. These systems should facilitate seamless integration and sharing of data across sectors and disciplines, ensuring interoperability, data provenance, data privacy and handling secured against emerging quantum threats via post-quantum cryptography, and compliance with applicable EU legal frameworks. Special emphasis is on enhancing data accuracy, representativeness, and relevance, particularly for use cases in industry, public services, citizen engagement, and the development of trustworthy AI applications, as well as the Common European Data Spaces. The development of such high-quality, semantically rich datasets will be essential to unlock the full potential of AI across domains.\n- Furthermore, the actions under Area 2 may also support the generation and use of high-quality synthetic data, including spatial synthetic data, to complement real-world datasets while preserving data privacy via advanced, state-of-the-art cryptographic protection. This may include, among others, the use of AI-enabled generative graphics pipelines to automate the creation of large-scale simulated environments and the application of parallelised and/or neuromorphic computing techniques to train AI models and artificial agents efficiently.\nThe actions under both areas should take into account the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre, particularly the blueprint for common European data spaces, and build synergies with related Union initiatives such as AI Factories, European Blockchain Services infrastructure, and the European Business Wallet, as well as with sector-specific Common European Data Spaces, and EU Digital Identity Wallet large scale pilots. Close collaboration with relevant European Partnerships, stakeholders, including industry, public administrations, and research organisations, will ensure that the systems meet the practical needs of data users while fostering innovation, competitiveness, and digital sovereignty within the Single Market.",

      "scope": "This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.\nTo overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.\nProposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).\nProposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:\n- Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;\n- Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;\n- Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;\n- Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;\n- Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life.\nActivities covering the following aspects are encouraged:\n- Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;\n- Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.\n- Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nProposals are expected to also establish cooperation and complementarity with the selected proposal under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-02-03: “Creating a digital passport to track battery materials, optimise battery performance and life, validate recycling, and promote a new business model based on data sharing (Batt4EU Partnership)” with regards to safety and ageing information as part of the battery passport.\nProposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) [1] whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu)\nJRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).\nProjects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.\nTo strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en",

      "scope": "The European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 2025 [3] , and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.\nThe instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.\nThe action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.\nThe project selected should address all of the following actions:\n- Make a consolidated analysis: on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions [4] of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation. of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions ’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium. of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities.\nMid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.\n- Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.\n- Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.\n- Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should be updated and completed on a regular basis.\n- Eventually provide a set of recommendations to the European Commission taking stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-projects in their Final reports on Societal Readiness. Practical improvements of the current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision [5] should be kept in mind when providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.\nAn analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) applied to R&I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed. Successful practices identified may complement recommendations to be provided to the Commission.\nInformation on e.g. on perceptions, feelings, concerns, past experiences on ways of working that is not translated into projects’ documents should be collected via direct interactions (bilateral discussions with respective project partners).\nThe action should also initiate similar monitoring activities on Societal Readiness pilot projects funded under future Horizon Europe work programmes, whenever operational phases of this action and new pilot projects overlap.\nA duration of 42 months is recommended for this action.\nThe proposed action requires the effective contribution of relevant SSH disciplines including the involvement of SSH experts to proficiently support the monitoring and evaluation of Societal Readiness pilot-projects in Cluster 5 work programme 2025.\n[1] Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics\n[2] Social Sciences and Humanities\n[3] HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-06; HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-04; HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-11; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-12\n[4] A declaration of confidentiality will be signed by the CSA\n[5] Societal Readiness is an indication of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for different societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing its potential for societal uptake and transition towards societal adaptation.

      "scope": "The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;\n- Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures [1] ;\n- Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;\n- Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;\n- Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;\n- Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD).\nSolutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04 [2] and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.\nAs the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01 [3] and other directly relevant call topics.\nIn view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad [4] and Diversify – CCAM [5] .\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

      "scope": "The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.\nThis will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving [1] and BERTHA [2] for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.\nTo achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.\nProposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART [3] and SUNRISE [4] and complemented by the project SYNERGIES [5] . Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 [6] . Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06 [7] .\nProposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for the parametrisation and validation of behavioural models, while considering regional and cultural differences as well as specificities of respective road infrastructures.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

      "scope": "CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.\nTo encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.\nEdge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus , it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM [1] and AIthena [2] .\n- Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES [3] . The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects;\n- Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently;\n- Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change.\nThe research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [4] .\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.\n[1] Trustworthy AI for CCAM, grant agreement ID: 101076911 .\n[2] AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: 101076754 .\n[3] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542 .\n[4] See the evaluation methodology here .",

      "scope": "Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space [1] aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).\nSeveral data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME [2] project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE [3] and SYNERGIES [4] . However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre [5] . In parallel, the DeployEMDS [6] builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.\nConsequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena [7] and AWARE2ALL [8] have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks.\nBy establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society.\nProposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps;\n- Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space;\n- Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles;\n- Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators;\n- Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform;\n- Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures.\nA strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects [9] is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl [10] . The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space ( Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving ). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium ( EDIC ) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [11] .\n[1] Creating a common European mobility data space - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] Framework for coordination of Automated Mobility in Europe, grant agreement ID: 101069898 .\n[3] Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: 101069573 .\n[4] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542 .\n[5] Data Spaces Blueprint\n[6] See for more information: https://deployemds.eu/\n[7] AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: 101076754 .\n[8] Safety systems and human-machine interfaces oriented to diverse population towards future scenarios with increasing share of highly automated vehicles, grant agreement ID: 101076868 .\n[9] The awarded proposal should build on the outcomes of the preparatory action PrepDSpace4Mobility and the EMDS study under CEF.

      "scope": "The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 [1] . To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.\nThe EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy [2] (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.\nResearch in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.\nProposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;\n- Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;\n- Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;\n- Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;\n- Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);\n- Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;\n- Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;\n- Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS [3] ), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.\nThe projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment [4] (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks [5] , in particular cascading impacts across sectors.\nProposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards, [6] and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.

      "scope": "Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods.

The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.\nTherefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.\nThe proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.\nProposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange.

Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.\nBuilding on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;\n- Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.\n- Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.\n- Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.\n- Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation;\n- Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics;\n- Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU [2] , the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [3] , and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain;\n- Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR [4] , digital identities [5] , data spaces [6] , AI act [7] , Data Governance Act [8] , Cybersecurity Act [9] ; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance.\n- Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices.\n- Identify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj .\n[2] Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52023PC0441\n[3] Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022L2464\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj\n[6] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces\n[7] Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n[8] Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0868\n[9] Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019R0881",

      "scope": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.\nAccurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:\n- Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime) [1] , Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) [2] , Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV) [6] and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU) [3] , and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);\n- Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER) [8] ;\n- Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards [9] ;\n- Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport [10] ;\n- Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector.\nBuilding on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:\n- The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;\n- Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;\n- Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;\n- New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;\n- Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information [11] .\nThe Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services.\nThe proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format; GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded; GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations.\n- Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular: a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations; allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft.\n- Based on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU);\n- Building on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive) [12] must be ensured;\n- Define R&I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions measuring framework.\nThe project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\nMechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[2] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[3] COM(2023) 441 final\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[6] Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[7] COM(2023) 441 final\n[8] https://emissionfactors.eu/\n[9] This standard has also been formally adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) under the reference CEN ISO 14083\n[10] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9781f65f-8448-11ea-bf12-01aa75ed71a1\n[11] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information\n[12] Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources, and repealing Council Directive (EU) 2015/652",

      "scope": "While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy [3] .\nProposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;\n- Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive [4] and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;\n- Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle;\n- Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC);\n- Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT;\n- Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains.\n[1] COM(2021) 324 final eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download\n[3] Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future, COM/2020/789 final\n[4] Directive (EU) 2023/2661",

      "scope": "The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.\nProposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:\n- Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;\n- Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;\n- Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;\n- Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;\n- Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;\n- Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards;\n- Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments: new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices; smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic; road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project; development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.\nSpecial focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc).\nProposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning.\nProposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions [1] and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and behavioural norms.\n[1] E.g. https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/861570 and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430 projects",

      "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- Knowledge of high-risk locations along the road network becoming available, before crashes actually occur, enabling road authorities to deploy appropriate countermeasures proactively;\n- Predictive identification of safety-critical situations based on data from multiple sources and enabling real-time interventions to avoid crashes;\n- Determination of the optimal sample size to allow for reliable real-time crash occurrence prediction;\n- Enhanced monitoring of traffic flows and incorporation of traffic flow variations and patterns in real-time crash prediction, which will also lead to more effective traffic management by foreseeing unexpected or disruptive events.",
      "scope": "One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.\nIn terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON [1] could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);\n- Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;\n- Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;\n- Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;\n- Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;\n- Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;\n- Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;\n- Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services.\nParticular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.\nWays to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.\nResearch is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.\n[1] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955269",

      "scope": "The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade.\nThe aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.\nTo enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):\n1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:\n- Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;\n- Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;\n- Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);\n- Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability.\n2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments [1] .\n3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:\n- Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;\n- High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);\n- Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);\n- Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.\nThis research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency:\n- RES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection\n- RES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD)\n- RES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis\n- RMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements\n- RMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance degradation\nA close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned.\n[1] Note: the project will assess the use of specific models for the prediction of icing conditions (e.g., addressing cloud micro-physics for the formation ice crystals, super cooled water droplets), which can be coupled to climate models (e.g., General Circulation Models).",

      "scope": "There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.\nMoreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.\nThe shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework [1] set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action [2] .\nFurther to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SO x emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH 4 , NO x , N 2 O, NH 3 , UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM [3] , as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions.\nLimited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future.\nAssessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N 2 O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted.\nIn addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place.\nWith CH 4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel.\nNew fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH 3) , methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N 2 O and NH 3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH 3 and H 2 , as well as dual-fuel engines and CO 2 capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO 2 is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced.\nDemonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR [4] .\nTo address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&I activities:\n- Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N 2 O, UFP, NH 3 , CH 4,, PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data;\n- Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports;\n- Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated;\n- Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area;\n- Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals;\n- Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates;\n- Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged;\n- Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations;\n- Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels;\n- Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation;\n- Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels;\n- Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, major port cities and coastal areas in the EU.\nProposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on “Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities should be avoided.\nProposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial.\nThe funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects selected under the topic of the EU Ocean & Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and ship source pollution policies.\nThis topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.\n[1] The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040. Measures include the adoption of lower-carbon fuels such as methanol and ammonia. In the EU, initiatives like FuelEU Maritime and ETS inclusion will drive this transition while regulations address harmful emissions like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, with Tier III NOx limits enforced. Discussions also focus on Black Carbon emissions in the Arctic and health impacts of ultrafine particles.\n[2] For example, evidence shows that the introduced Tiers may not be effective in controlling NOx emissions in real vessel operation, scrubbers may result in the formation of new ultra-fine particles, ammonia combustion potentially leads to the formation of nitrous oxide and ammonia slip, methanol combustion may lead to the production of formaldehyde, LNG may result in the slip of methane, etc. Obviously, any strategy targeting the control of GHG or air pollutants should not result in negative side-effects such as the release of harmful pollutants which are today not covered by regulations.\n[3] CH4 – methane; NOx - nitrogen oxides; N20 – nitrous oxide; UFP – ultra-fine particles; BC – black carbon; PM – particulate matter.\n[4] Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable",

      "expected_outcome": "A quite wide portfolio of technologies, which are close to be deployed but still lack the real-world demonstration of economic viability, exists. Significant volumes of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\n- Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;\n- Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\n- Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;\n- National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime.\n- Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns;\n- The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated.",
      "scope": "Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO 2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Proposals are expected to:\n- demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity;\n- address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO 2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate);\n- address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate.\nProjects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available.\nProduction of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic.\nThe projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions.\nThe plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment and business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants.\nAn assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production. Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG emissions reduction potential; projects are encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund.",

Advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute to net-zero manufacturing in Europe.

      "scope": "Projects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.\nCompetitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO 2 suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO 2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.\nValue chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.\nA sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.",

      "expected_outcome": "The EU’s Offshore Strategy [1] underlines that the deployment of offshore wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023) [2] .\nOur knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted [3] . However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.\nImproving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR [4] in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;\n- The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;\n- Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;\n- Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones.",
      "scope": "Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:\n- Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;\n- Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;\n- Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;\n- Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;\n- Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;\n- Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;\n- Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project.\nParticular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures.\nComplementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core infrastructure , for instance the projects funded under topics:\n- HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06: Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean;\n- HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms.\nIn addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics.\nEnvironmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy.\n[1] COM(2020) 741 final\n[2] COM (2023) 668 final - EUR-Lex - 52023DC0668 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)\n[3] See for instance the ETC/ICM Report 2/2022: Mapping potential environmental impacts of offshore renewable energy, at: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy\n[4] https://www.ospar.org/",

      "expected_outcome": "The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda [1] .",
      "scope": "Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;\n- Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;\n- Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;\n- Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;\n- Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.\n- Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process.\nProposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\"",

      "expected_outcome": "Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation. The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;\n- Increased module durability and reliability;\n- Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;\n- Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);\n- Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda [1] .",
      "scope": "The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:\n- Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;\n- Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;\n- Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;\n- Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime.\nDifferent locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

      "scope": "The challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.\nThe operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.\nThe EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects.\nProposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.\nActivities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.\nThe proposed action is to be structured as following:\nPreparation phase :\nParticipating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8).\nThe procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to be necessarily tested at the same site.\nAt the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation of the lead procurer.\nExecution phase :\nThis phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts.\nThe procurement will be executed as a single joint procedure in which different lots can be considered. The research and specification works are expected to lead to at least two commercial scale demonstrators tested for at least 12 months in a commercially representative site during the action duration following the IEA-OES [1] stage-gate metrics.\nResults will be shared with the European industry to accelerate the technology development and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of knowledge creation. At the end of the action, at least one of the demonstrators is expected to be ready for testing in an operational environment at commercial scale.\nAt the end of the action, designs are expected to be ready to proceed to Stage 5 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas (Commercial-scale array demonstration).\n[1] IEA-OES: International Energy Agency – Ocean Energy Systems",

This includes the integration with various data sources and sectors, such as mobility, to promote decentralisation, energy-efficiency, and cost-efficiency and to enable interoperability across different parts of the energy system;\n- Explore the potential of generative AI for system optimisation through scenario generation, simulation, and time series forecasting, while also developing optimisation tools for both supply-side and demand-side management using forecasts and data for renewable energy, transmission assets, storage, and energy-saving applications for consumers;\n- Propose tools and control systems to apply generative AI solutions developed in a high-risk use-case (as defined in the AI act).\nThe developed solutions should be dynamic, flexible, offering reconfigurable automated management, control and data exchange to ensure seamless operations across decentralised a setting.\nProjects are expected to:\n- Demonstrate AI-powered energy services, tools for power system planning and operation, and smart grid functionalities, such as flexibility, and electric vehicle (EV) charging as well as possibly transmission system operation across at least three EU member states and/or associated countries to enhance demand flexibility and drive innovative capabilities for decarbonisation and energy efficiency;\n- Indicate which generative AI basic tools, including available tools from the AI Factories, will be used and demonstrate how energy sector users will be involved in the development and the testing (and possible uptake) of the generative AI tools by the project;\n- Indicate what types of assets and what data sources will be used and involved in the project;\n- Involve both traditional energy stakeholders and new entrants, such as energy service companies, aggregators, digital infrastructure providers, system integrators, energy asset manufacturers, energy communities, and active consumers;\n- Leverage relevant European and international standards and technical specifications, and actively engage with standards development organisations;\n- Contribute to the BRIDGE initiative [3] , actively participate in its activities;\n- Make use of the AI Factories and solutions, open-source where relevant, building on developments in previous Horizon Europe projects, particularly those related to flexibility markets and data exchange, Internet of Things and edge-cloud computing, adhering to relevant standards and engaging with standards development organisations to further develop these standards;\n- Demonstrate how the new solutions can be integrated into and/or replace (parts of) existing legacy systems, including (for projects that focus on DSOs) demonstrate how the new solutions can integrate core functions of grid operations including SCADA systems functionality;\n- Jointly provide a diverse set of applications of generative AI.\n[1] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories\n[2] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/accelerating-green-transition-role-digital-infrastructures-decarbonising-energy-and-mobility\n[3] https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/",

      "scope": "The project should:\n- Develop innovative and open-source tools for managing shared energy community assets (e.g., energy storage facilities) and optimising energy community management (e.g., selection and switching of aggregators, preparation and trading of smart contracts, peer-to-peer and energy sharing, self-consumption);\n- Develop open-source tools for forecasting, prediction and advanced data analysis using AI tools and in-depth data analysis for customers and prosumers for autonomous optimisation of consumption, production, storage, smart devices (appliances), and electric vehicle (EV) both at household and energy community levels;\n- Extend DSO SCADA and substation systems for autonomous control of grid assets and seamlessly integrate these systems with home and building energy management systems for direct and fast control and data acquisition to implement local (distribution) grid services (constrain alleviation, grid reconfiguration, restoration of supply, maintenance, and enhancement of energy quality), real-time assessment and monetisation of the use of grid resources;\n- Integrate the three elements above as a basis to establish a platform for cooperation between individual customers or prosumers, entire energy communities, wide area aggregators, and DSOs to provide, acquire, and settle energy system-oriented services (system-wide balancing, support of frequency regulation). The cooperation platform should be based on a plug-and-play integration of the energy community eco-system components (hardware and software), using and extending relevant communication standards and data models. The integration mechanism should be embedded within the core systems used by customers/prosumers, DSO (and TSO), aggregators and market operators, fully aligned with SGAM;\n- Develop tailored security solutions for private and public communication networks used by IoT apps and devices (smart appliances) across energy carriers;\n- Ensure the follow-up and implementation of EU policy measures, including by conducting quality assessments and introducing national community energy targets;\n- Foster institutional allies at local and regional levels;\n- Provide access to and capacities for using digital planning tools;\n- Identify the barriers for network operators (e.g. legal, economic, regulatory etc.) who want to introduce smart consumption options for their customers.\nPreferably semantically interoperable interactions, as enabled by the ETSI SAREF ontologies, are used. Furthermore, the project should follow the IEC TR 63097 Smart Grid Roadmap, and where relevant, the developed solutions should be open for off-shelf integration using common communication and data standards.\nThe project should benefit from the direct participation of energy communities, smart appliances manufacturers, home energy devices manufacturers, home and building energy management system developers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), and aggregators.\nHowever, in order to comply with Article 33, 36 and 54 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, TSOs or DSOs participating in this project should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities or recharging points for electric vehicles. Moreover, the role of the distribution system operator in facilitating peer to peer trading should be without prejudice to the rules in Article 35 Directive (EU) 2019/944.\nThe developed solutions have to be tested within, at least, three energy communities from different European countries, preferably in regions with different socio-economic development contexts and different resource availabilities. Technical and social characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions' credibility. The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems.\nIn order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities.\nThe selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively participate in its activities. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g., clusters of digital projects and coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant.\nIn particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.",

The consortium should assess the current regulatory context and provide recommendations linked to the proposed solutions for shaping future needs (e.g., regulatory, standardisation, permitting). In addition, appropriate local community engagement initiatives as well as expectations and experiences of underground thermal storage infrastructures (and to what extent it varies in dense urban areas) should be explored.\nThis topic requires citizens engagement and dialogue and the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities and ensure the translation of innovation into real-life outputs.",

For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities.\nFor point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process.\nThe use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.\nIn particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission [1] is encouraged.\n[1] Carbon Dioxide Removal – Mission Innovation (mission-innovation.net)",

      "scope": "Buildings result in greenhouse gas emissions over their whole life cycle (operational and embodied emissions). Buildings can also contribute to long-term carbon removals by storing carbon in construction products. Construction and renovation works must also meet a variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.\nProposals are expected to address all the following:\n- Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;\n- Develop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions;\n- Validate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;\n- Research the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;\n- Consider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;\n- Contribute to the development of European standards [2] , where relevant;\n- Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters [3] .\nSelected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People).

R&I in this area has been identified as a priority by the EU-India Trade and Technology Council’s Working Group on Green and Clean Energy Technology to reinforce bilateral cooperation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Battery recyclers based in the EU and India benefit from of the improved sustainability, safety, and affordability of innovative recycling processes.\n- Stakeholders on battery recycling based in the EU and India benefit from each other’s experience on recycling logistics, including the informal processes and supply chain constraints.\n- The cooperation between EU and India key researchers, institutions and industries which are active in battery recycling is supported and strengthened.",
      "scope": "Projects are expected to build a jointly operated recycling pilot line on Indian soil demonstrating innovative recycling processes for lithium-ion batteries going beyond the current state of the art in terms of recycling efficiency (in particular of Li), environmental impact, cost, and compatibility with different types of batteries (including those currently on the market and to be anticipated in the coming years). The pilot line must be able to process black mass including mixed chemistries with Li as end product, with a purity level suitable for Cathode Active Material (CAM). Recovery of graphite or silicon/graphite in various compositions should also be addressed. Adequate benchmarking figures must be provided to show progress beyond the state of the art.\nProjects are also expected to demonstrate effective use of technologies for logistics, sorting, collection and discharging of end-of-life batteries. This should involve the informal sector (i.e. end users, collection points, sales channels) and include the following two areas:\n- Development of innovative and digitalised waste collection systems towards zero-risk to improve quantity, quality, safety of the stored End of Life batteries\n- Safe, fast, cost-efficient ways for large-scale discharging/deactivation End of Life batteries (both damaged and scraps), anticipating the development for new chemistries.\nProjects are furthermore expected to assess the environmental impact of the piloted innovations in the recycling processes through Life Cycle Analysis.\nProjects to be aligned with the missions, policies and priorities in the area of battery recycling, in both the regions (India and the EU). On the Indian side, alignment with relevant regulatory and strategic frameworks is expected, such as the Battery Waste Management Rules (2022) and the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage. EU projects are expected to build upon the activities of past and ongoing recycling-related projects under the BATT4EU partnership, as well as progress being made on the implementation of the Battery Passport. Projects are furthermore expected to be in line with the Batteries Regulation [1] (in particular with sections referring to recycling efficiency) and the Safe and Sustainable by Design guidelines [2] .\nThe exploitation of results, including IPR, should be appropriately addressed in the proposal.\nJoint work should benefit from the Indian and European experience in battery recycling. Aligned projects should have the same start date, the same duration, same targets, and must show clearly how the coordination among them will bring added scientific value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects a genuine EU-Indian cooperation, aligned projects should involve properly coordinated research activities between EU and India in the jointly developed research plan of the two coordinated projects. Independent projects, which are not aligned, will be considered ineligible. Proposals will include detailed explanations about tasks and effort of the coordinated proposal as a whole and cross-references to the other part of the proposal.\nThe coordinated call aims at exploiting synergies between India and Europe in terms of scientific expertise and resources in topics related to battery recycling by implementing coordinated projects. Potential areas for collaboration (i.e. the coordinated part of the call) could include (but are not limited to) demonstration of more flexible and adaptable recycling processes capable of treating mixed battery chemistries; innovative & digitalised waste collection systems; advanced sorting systems; active monitoring systems for high level of safety; safe, fast and cost-efficient discharging/deactivation (gen4 included); prediction for second-life use of batteries, diagnostics including State of Health.\nThe topic is within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in relation to battery recycling technologies. For the purposes of this topic, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI), Government of India has made the required funding available for the coordinated projects of the Indian side. A balanced effort and matched budget between Europe and India regarding the two coordinated calls are expected.\n[1] Regulation - 2023/1542 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/recommendation-safe-and-sustainable-chemicals-published-2022-12-08_en",

Meanwhile, a surge in the number of end-of-life (EOL) PV modules is expected, of which crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV is the main type. It would therefore be beneficial to improve the eco-design and sustainability of silicon-based solar cells and modules, by reducing the use of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs), revalorising the use of recycled silicon waste, adopting recyclable/repairable module designs and extending their lifetime without compromising their reliability and durability.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Ultra-low carbon footprint and reduced environmental impact PV cells/modules through lifetime extension, Ag or In free, and with designs that allow recyclability and repairability;\n- Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

Injection tests can be done with water only to reduce cost and testing duration, although this could possibly (but not necessarily) be complemented by water with CO2 (or N2) to determine the reservoir injectivity with different phases.\n- Cooperate with a national competent authority to ensure support in terms of the selection of the priority target formations and to have access to existing subsurface data. Demonstrate how the test site has been identified, and that CO2 storage is legally possible in the designated area.\n- Test sites must be in a saline aquifer at a minimal depth of 800 m, in a geologically stable area, with minimal faulting and fracturing, that provide significant scalable storage capacity (proven confinement, limited heterogeneity, and with favourable porosity and permeability and porosity), and are expected to gain the necessary permits, following the appraisal and testing. The geological conditions of the site should be defined in term of risks as it is in the Directive, that is, proposed site must demonstrate, in line with existing data, that prior analysis shows that, under the proposed conditions of use, there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.\n- Tests should be designed as to allow a reliable quantification of the injectivity index. Test duration should be optimised to achieve a representative pressure transient response.\n- The Horizon Europe grant can support all data acquisition, processing and interpretation, modelling, the drilling, completion and logging of the test well, the injectivity test, and the measuring & monitoring technologies. These operations can be carried out by the consortium or be subcontracted.\nThis topic contributes to the R&I activity in the SET-Plan CCUS Implementation Plan [1] to unlock CO2 storage capacity through support to pre-commercial appraisal activities.\n[1] 06700519-1f0f-49b7-bd03-b9021e08fc1b_en",

      "scope": "The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and innovation priorities and targets for wind energy, as defined by the Implementation Working Group (IWG) on wind energy, the European Technology and Innovation Platform on wind energy (ETIP Wind) [1] and the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) joint programme on wind energy [2] .\nThe activities carried out by the project will pertain to the following priority R&I areas:\n- Industrialisation, scale-up and competitiveness: mass production supported by automation and reliable supply chains, design for large volume manufacturing and deployment, design for reliable and lasting products and improved construction and installation methods, digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial environment.\n- Optimisation and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance: integration of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, advanced repair methodologies and new sensor technologies, interoperability among wind farm sub-systems, advanced communication technologies and cybersecurity, innovative component replacement solutions and quick connect/disconnect systems for mooring lines and inter-array cables.\n- Wind energy system integration: definition and modelling of future system needs, advanced grid capabilities, interoperability, solutions to effectively manage curtailment, integration with energy storage technologies and hybrid plants, distributed wind energy.\n- Sustainability and circularity: material substitution for decarbonisation, material reduction, recycling methods, lifetime extension via re-using, refurbishing and re-purposing, new decommissioning tools and methods and solutions to minimise the environmental and biodiversity impacts and optimise the socio-economic impacts.\n- Floating offshore wind: development and demonstration of innovative technologies for offshore floating wind. Development of optimised floating wind energy systems through the integrated design of the different elements of the system, including the floater and the generation part.\n- Research and technology infrastructures for wind energy: upgrade of existing and establishment of new infrastructures and test centres for the sector. An area of particular interest in this domain are large-scale testing facilities for offshore floating wind energy systems.\n- Wind energy systems interactions with climate, atmosphere, ocean and geophysics: geophysical characteristics measuring and modelling, wake effect model development, climate change impact analysis\n- Environmental and social aspects, coexistence: evolution of environmental impact assessments, spatial planning, biodiversity solutions, reduced pollution (e.g. noise and vibration, pollution due to erosion of the blades), design and implementation of practices and platforms that facilitate inclusive communication and stakeholders’ involvement, tools to map stakeholder concerns and development of practical approaches to lifecycle public participation, socialisation of wind rights, relationship between people, technology and places for all relevant social issues\n- Emerging technologies: new concept assessment and development (e.g. multirotor concepts, tip rotor designs, ducted turbines), improved performance and efficiency of emerging/innovative wind energy systems\nStructure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation\nThe action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities implemented through financial support to third parties. The R&I activities are divided into three challenges:\n- Breakthrough challenge\n- Validation challenge\n- Demonstration challenge\nThe breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities.\nThe breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new and potentially disruptive solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the wind energy sector and on the acceleration of wind energy deployment at scale both off- and onshore, including with experimental proof of concept, as well as with validation both in laboratory and relevant environment, as appropriate. Concepts and technologies initially developed through the breakthrough challenge could be further matured through the validation challenge.\nThe validation challenge entails actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions, both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment that have been developed in the project but also developed previously and separately in other European and national projects. For the validation, the project can consider different use cases (e.g. onshore, offshore).\nThe demonstration challenge entails demonstration activities to accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry, in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan (activities up to TRL 7-8). It will solely be implemented by the core consortium.\nThe total maximum amount of EU funding for the demonstration activities is expected to be 50 million Euros.\nThe project is expected to implement at least 3 demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The proposed solutions should be demonstrated for a continuous period of at least 6 months.\nThe project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone, for each demonstration activity, before entering the deployment phase. Before each go/no-go milestone, the project is expected to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans, compliant with the applicable standards and iii) a complete business and implementation plan. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project proposal is also expected to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this, the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.\nPrivileged research and innovation areas for the demonstration challenge are the ones listed from a. to f. in the scope: a. industrialisation, scale-up and competitiveness, b. optimisation and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance, c. wind energy system integration, d. sustainability and circularity, e. floating offshore wind and f. research and technology infrastructures for wind energy.\nActivities directly implemented by the core consortium\nThe activities of the core consortium are expected to include the implementation of direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects). It is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.\nActivities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)\nA share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to support research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.\nThe use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, attracting different stakeholders and innovators to develop and validate new technological solutions in the wind sector and respond quickly to new challenges. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&I work can continue without major interruption.\nThe demonstration challenge is excluded from FSTP calls.\nFor the FSTP calls, the following should be taken into account:\n- Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of the long-term R&I challenges. Up to 8 million EUR of the EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The FSTP breakthrough challenge should aim at attracting innovative entities that does not necessarily have the capacity to apply directly for EU grants.\n- Validation challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 16 million EUR of the EU requested contribution is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.\nThe first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP calls for the validation challenge must be published in a later stage considering the experience and the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core project R&I activities. The duration of the actions supported by FSTP should not be longer than 18 months.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nFor the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [3] .\nGovernance of the project\nThe project will have to set out how and with what frequency the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.\nThe core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.\nThe project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in wind energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Wind Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership related initiative and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advises the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET Plan activities and goals. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.\nThe proposal should define mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), benchmarking and progress monitoring). Besides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the wind energy sector [4] . The project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.\nThe consortium will have to present a clear risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.\nIn the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges and actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). A given action supported by such FSTP scheme can be implemented by one third party or a by consortium of entities.\nAs regards data management, in addition to fulfilling the standard research data management and open access requirements in line with the Grant Agreement provisions, the project is expected to set up a platform, possibly re-using an already existing one, to ensure the accessibility and maintenance of the data generated by the project. The platform should be able to organise and host data generated by other research and innovation projects on wind energy. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable)\nThe consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D community.\nCooperation with International Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) on wind energy systems\nFor activities carried out that are also covered by relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Cooperation Programme for wind energy systems [5] , proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.\nDuration\nThe estimated project duration is around 5 years.\n[1] See for instance: ETIP Wind Strategic Research & Innovation Agenda 2025-2027 - November 2023\n[2] See for instance: NeWindEERA – A New Research Programme for the European Wind Energy Sector – September 2024\n[3] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[4] ETIP Wind, EERA JP Wind and IWG Wind (2025); “From innovation to industrial competitiveness – How wind R&I funding will deliver European technology sovereignty”.

      "scope": "The implementation of zero emission vehicles for long-distance heavy-duty freight transport is of key importance to meet the European targets reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. To further accelerate HD-BEV integration in logistic fleets and operations it is essential to identify and address the remaining barriers and challenges of their deployment. These barriers can be related to e.g. limitations in vehicle technology, digital tools, knowledge and user awareness, stakeholder engagement, energy and power availability, charging infrastructure needs such as depot charging and Megawatt Charging System (MCS), permit processes and connection to the grid and services. The challenges for logistics companies’ (also smaller operators) implementing zero emission transport solutions need to be addressed.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Perform large-scale demonstrations of HD BEV equipped with MCS reaching up to a hundred market-ready vehicles and new generation vehicles in logistics fleets operations, involving several transport operators also engaging SMEs and microenterprises, focussing on long-haul operation (average ≥600km operations) during extended durations of over twelve months. The demonstrations must cover at least four European corridors’ segments in at least four Member States (MS) and/or Associated Countries (AC), and involved HD BEV should where possible be also equipped with MCS connector.\n- Identify and address the barriers and challenges to accelerate the deployment of fleets of HD-BEV in long-distance logistics operations in Europe, considering also the impact of battery degradation and the weather conditions in all seasons.\n- Develop and integrate in the demonstrations the use of digital tools with use of AI, access to data sets, operational and governance logistics models including charging opportunities and models to facilitate increasing numbers of HD-BEVs in logistics operations\n- Ensure synergies with the existing publicly accessible charging infrastructure available or funded under the CEF and/or other national/regional funding schemes and assess charging methods and business models for long-haul operations such as depot, destination, truck-stops, overnight etc., using different charging power considering cost and time optimisation. Only depot charging (mono and/or multi-operator) infrastructure can be (partially) funded in demonstration projects, including related innovative business models associated such as smart, bidirectional V2X solutions and possible second life of batteries.\n- Develop a competition-compliant ecosystem for sharing data for HD-BEV fleet management in so-called data labs including data pooling, which can include publication of open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data, and which could build on the common European mobility data space, also supporting the dissemination best practices, learnings and capacity building mechanisms as levers for HD-BEV acceleration. Using the shared data, new services and tools can be developed, including AI-based tools, agents and model frameworks for fleet management, both for on-board and remote monitoring.\n- Define and test use cases for the use of HD-BEV fleets in long-distance logistics operations for cross-border flows, operational strategies to shift freight transport demand to zero-emission solutions, and collaborative business model(s).\n- Establish synergies and leverage with previous and ongoing projects related to HD-BEV and charging systems and with related forums, platforms and programmes, such as with the European Clean Corridors Initiative, as part of the Automotive Action Plan. [1]\n- Map and assess how policies and relevant legislation (including incentives) can support an affordable transition to HD-BEV. Identify and address, by providing recommendations, remaining legal and regulatory barriers encountered in the demonstrations.\nAn analysis of the potential economic, social and environmental benefits (notably greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions reduction) must be included in the demonstrations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] e.g.: Research projects - 2Zero Emission ; Sustainable Transport Forum (STF) - European Commission , “European Clean Transport Corridor initiative” – Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector (COM(2025) 95 final).",

      "scope": "In the past years a variety of road vehicle technologies on component and sub-system level (e. g. mechanical, electro-mechanical, electro-chemical, etc.) have been developed and offer the potential to be combined and improve user benefits at the embedded system level. The potential to further leverage these developments with Software Defined Vehicle solutions (e.g. high-level functionality ranging from energy efficiency and performance improvements to personalizing the driving experience) over the lifetime of the vehicle needs to be explored. This would bring together developers working at the embedded system level with those working on high-level functions also to ensure that novel solutions will conform with homologation requirements. Solutions coming from this project must also be compatible with current automotive standards, esp. regarding external infrastructure. Compatibility e.g. with EVSE regarding ISO 15118-20 must be ensured.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects, where possible building upon available open-source building blocks:\n- Investigate the potential of novel propulsion and chassis system/sub-systems packaging and performance from a holistic EV architecture perspective and for fast charging, significantly improving the current State-of-Art performance via digital solutions and leveraging AI when beneficial.\n- Include chassis and traction hardware solutions as well as standardised control and physical interfaces to improve innovation speed and software solutions, also leveraging the potential of open source.\n- Develop a system architecture to ensure optimal compatibility with the high-level SW and the physical powertrain and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems (e.g. mechanical, electro-mechanical, etc.) with appropriate SW tooling for efficient SDV development, integration and validation, e.g. operational functionality, also including driving range improvement according to user expectations. Target applications are expected to be fit for mass-market M1 C-segment vehicle or below.\n- Identify required software interfaces (Application Programming Interface and/or software services), i.e. especially which kind of information/data are required for an energy-efficient in the context of powertrain, chassis, automated driving and vehicle SW/interfaces needed for vehicle-to-grid functionalities, considering the vehicle and environment.\n- Develop solutions that minimize energy use while meeting users’ expectations, such as battery management, predictive maintenance, or eco-efficient routing and driving systems, leveraging AI-driven workflows when beneficial. When using AI-based approaches, projects are expected to ensure that the use AI in electric vehicles does not increase the overall energy need.\n- Ensure the consistency of data and information from different sources and different market players to ensure the scaling potential of solutions (i.e. in-vehicle interfaces as part of the Vehicle Signal Specification, e.g. COVESA, Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle). [2]\n- Propose recommendations on possible test protocols for future implementation and safety ratings.\n- Collaborate with the Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative under the Chips JU [3] by adopting relevant existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework. Ensure close coordination with the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European Automotive Action Plan.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

      "scope": "Ports are important multimodal hubs in the supply chain, linking the sea with the hinterland, evolving into critical hubs and facilitators of sustainable energies, are clusters of industry and circular economy, as well as geo-political and geo-economic resilience. Europe needs ports that are competitive and sustainable on local, regional and global levels, and the Competitiveness Compass calls for a new strategy to highlight the role that European ports will play in the future EU economy.\nThe Green Deal aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reverse the degradation of ecosystems by 2030 . The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy [1] (SSMS) states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change, less biodiversity harmful and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that ports can provide increasing volumes of clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, and on a modernised grid.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Identify innovative technologies, as well as results from EU-funded research, innovation and deployment projects and other technological, economic and social best practices. Consider mature technologies ready to be deployed in middle and small-sized ports across the EU contributing to the expected outcomes. Address challenges and opportunities for the implementation and/or for commercial deployment of these solutions in small and medium-sized maritime ports and inland waterway ports located throughout the EU.\n- Developing strategies contributing to the expected outcomes for middle and small ports across the EU following a geographical balance, contributing to the objectives of the EU Ports Strategy.\n- Design and demonstrate integrated smart energy systems and grids for port and waterborne transport operations, including energy production, storage and OPS operations, covering the needs for electrification and charging of port terminal equipment, and modes of transport connecting the port to the hinterland, such road transport, nearby industry and buildings) to make the solutions more energy- and cost-effective.\n- Develop climate resilience strategies of middle and small size ports and their infrastructure, including adaptation measures to address sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related risks, with a focus on cost-effective and scalable solutions (such as nature-based solutions), building on best practices developed in EU-funded research projects.\n- Analyse how VTMIS and port community systems can be developed and exploited to their full potential, harmonizing functionalities whenever possible, paving the way to automatic shipping. Consider possible linkages to eMSW and eFTI.\n- Apply digital standards and common semantics which enable the harmonisation of collection and analysis of GHG and pollutant emissions at small and medium sized TEN-T ports network.\n- When developing digital solutions proposals should consider cybersecurity implications and develop solutions that assess and manage vulnerabilities in IT and OT systems, establish robust incident response plans, implement strong access control measures, network and supply chain security, in line with EU standards such as the NIS Directive and the Cybersecurity Act and with the goal of achieving resilience and redundancy.\n- Explore long-term workforce requirements for zero-emission, climate-resilient, biodiversity friendly, safe and competitive port operations, ensuring continuous knowledge transfer between universities, vocational training providers and industry.\n- Develop a R&I roadmap for solutions of EU and EEA ports to address the areas covered under the expected outcomes, taking into consideration 2035 as an intermediate milestone and 2050 as the final one.\n- Explore, with competent authorities and stakeholders, how environmental aspects related to zero pollution and circular economy for ports as well as maritime and inland waterway vessels can be improved in an environmentally and economically sustainable way (through reception facilities, degassing facilities, OPS...), in line with the ambition expressed in i.a. NAIADES III, SUMPs, local or regional Air Quality Plans and Waste Management Plans. Collaborate with industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to align project outcomes with EU policy objectives, particularly the Port Strategy.\n- Explore cooperation between ports, as well as stronger horizontal networking, to increase the efficiency of undertakings and improve the integration of European ports.\n- Evaluate the financial implications of proposed solutions and identify possible strategies and tools for financing/funding as well as business models that go beyond request of public support.\nSolutions at project level must be demonstrated in at least six medium and small-sized TEN-T ports ensuring a geographical balance, of which five are maritime ports and one inland. Not all solution must necessarily be demonstrated in all ports.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

      "scope": "European shipbuilding industry is facing increasing pressure from international players, and there is a need to improve its competitiveness through innovation and technological advancements. The MARI-4YARD project together with RESURGAM, FIBRE4YARDS, SMARTYards and PENELOPE developed several solutions on materials, processes, AI and skills. Additionally, the project SEUS in Horizon Europe is developing an integrated software platform with the ambition to save time in engineering, assembly and construction at European shipyards. However, there is still a need to increase the ambition and demonstrate these solutions in medium and small-size shipyards.\nAt the same time, shipyards are often located in sensitive natural areas, such as coastal regions and estuaries. This provides an opportunity for shipyards to evaluate and reduce their impact on the surrounding biodiversity.\nThe topic aims to improve efficiency and sustainability of European ship newbuilding and retrofitting processes, to improve the use of resources and circularity, to develop necessary skills and improve working conditions. This requires considering all relevant innovations such as robotics, automation, digitalization and AI in the context of shipbuilding to enhance EU/EEA -focused value chains. The purpose is to increase the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding sector with a view to further replicating and utilizing results, including in potential applications to the Innovation Fund.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Deployment and integration of innovative technologies and systems in small and medium-size EU and EEA shipyards to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of newbuild, repair and retrofit processes and process chains.\n- Pilot applications should consider all aspects of the shipbuilding process (including technological, business-related and organizational aspects), equipment, and ship design, potentially including: a) automation and robotics in shipbuilding processes; b) advanced digitalization in design and production; c) innovations in retrofitting and predictive maintenance of shipbuilding assets; circular economy in all relevant processes (construction, repairs, retrofitting and dismantling).\n- Pilot applications should also consider systems interoperability and integration with existing shipyard infrastructure, tools and equipment.\n- Explore advanced ways of digital collaboration (co-simulation, sharing digital data) while considering cyber security, to improve synergies within value chains, including equipment manufacturers, shipyards, ship designers and shipowners.\n- Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies in real life shipyard ecosystem and as much as possible in relation with full scale ship building, including benchmarking of existing practices and consideration of environmental impacts and potential safety improvements for workers. Demonstrations should take place in at least three EU/EEA shipyards.\n- Develop biodiversity friendly strategies, integrating nature-based solutions on site, promoting circularity and sustainability of processes.\n- Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant.\n- Propose measures to solidify the current strengths of smaller and medium-sized shipyards across Europe, with a focus on increasing competitiveness and growth, reinforcing and growing European shipyards and improving environmental performance.\n- For exploitation purposes, proposals should: a) develop business plans and rollout strategies, including measures to reduce knowledge and technology leakage outside of Europe; b) identify clear target groups (vessel types, segments and processes) and their current state, deficiencies and improvement needs, and make a clear exploitation strategy on how to roll out the results to end-users.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

      "scope": "The rapid transition to low and zero-carbon solutions in maritime and inland waterborne transport requires port authorities and stakeholders to swiftly adapt to supply large quantities of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels and electricity. However, this shift poses new safety challenges, particularly in port areas where multiple bunkering operations, import/export terminals, and fuel handling and storage activities coexist. The close location of most ports to cities and inhabited areas raises issues of safety on two fronts: the space deficit due to the difficulty of enlarging the port areas in these locations, (leading to e.g. the storage of various fuels in close proximity), and the broader danger to these inhabited areas due to their proximity to the ports and by extension the storage of these fuels. To ensure a safe and efficient energy transition, it is crucial to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in port areas. As not all ports will be able to store every type of clean fuel in the port or neighbouring area, safety of transport and distribution within the port area (including anchorage) should also be analysed.\nExisting EU legislation regarding specifically the safety of port workers is limited. The Directive on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (2001/96/EC) sets out the EU requirements which increase safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid cargo in EU ports. Further instruments such as the Directive on port State control (2009/16/EC) and the Directive on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector (2009/18/EC, recently amended) , while related to safety in the maritime sector, do not apply to the safety of port workers specifically. Broader instruments such as the EU Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive (89/391/EEC) and the Directive on the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for the Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work (2009/104/EC) , while applicable to port workers due to their general character, miss the intricacies needed to address the specific risks of workers in this sector. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that port workers are being exposed to new risks due to the rising use of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in the maritime sector and the need for safe bunkering and storage of these fuels in port areas.\nGiven the above it is important to have a clear picture of the current status regarding the storage and bunkering of fuels across EU ports, identify existing and applicable legislation, map gaps and potential risks and make appropriate recommendations for follow-up actions.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Conduct a comprehensive review of the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels within (inland and sea) the port areas, including distribution, simultaneous bunkering operations, import/export terminals, handling and storage of fuels.\n- Analyse gaps in existing regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the safe handling and storage of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, in maritime and inland TEN-T ports.\n- Identify safety risks not adequately addressed by current rules and risk assessments, including Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) taking into account - inter-alia - gas dispersion, fire/explosion impacts and their probabilities using F-N curves.\n- Develop guidelines and recommendations to ensure safe operations (considering environmental and health aspects) per fuel type in port areas, considering varying port sizes, services (including technical-nautical vessels), locations, and geographies, especially for ports located in populated areas including establishing safety zones. International rules, standards and guidelines should be taken into consideration (especially from the IMO and the IHPA where relevant). Relevant environmental Plans required by EU or national legislation such as Air Quality Plans should be considered.\n- Develop standard risk assessment criteria for groups of ports with similar characteristics, operational and weather conditions by researching and establishing standard criteria for risk assessments in port planning and development. This includes defining safety-by-design procedures for new port infrastructures and bunkering operations.\n- Engage with relevant stakeholders, including port authorities, terminal operators, shipping companies, trade unions and regulatory bodies, to ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the developed guidelines and recommendations.\n- Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. This strategy should include the design and implementation of comprehensive training modules tailored to various roles within port operations, focusing on the specific safety protocols and procedures associated with renewable low and zero-carbon fuels.\n- Propose certification and continuous professional development pathways to maintain high safety standards and adapt to evolving technologies and regulations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT).

Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.",

      "scope": "With continuous increase in electrification of the car fleet and railways, the share of non-exhaust particulate emissions into the environment becomes increasingly important. Non-exhaust emissions (NEE) of particles apply to all forms of ground transport and can be categorised as those coming from several sources, such as brake wear, tyre wear, pantograph-catenary wear, wheel-rail contact, road surface wear, as well as vehicle-induced resuspension of road/track dust deposited on the surface. There may be other sources, e.g. engine belts and clutch plates. Quantitative data on the magnitude of non-exhaust emissions are fragmented and highly uncertain, particularly when compared to data for exhaust emissions. Emissions vary widely according to brake, tyre and road surface material, and with driving style. Further research efforts are necessary to increase the understanding of these particles, their creation, ageing and dispersion in the environment.\nMoreover, the health impact of NEEs is far less studied, and it remains unclear whether these predominately solid/non-soluble PM may induce the same effects as combustion PM. Additionally, these pollutants has been reported to adversely affect terrestrial systems and aquatic environment as well as the biodiversity; however, it is not clear to what extent.\nResearch into rail particulate emissions is an equally important area due to its implications for air quality, human health, and environmental impact. However, research data on the health impacts of specific particulate components is limited. Furthermore, comprehensive studies on the chemical composition of rail particulates are scarce. The impact of rail particulates on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity is not well understood, while more data is needed on how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas. Addressing these research gaps would provide a more comprehensive understanding of rail particulate emissions and contribute to the development of effective mitigation strategies.\nIn order to address the two aforementioned areas (road and rail), R&I actions are expected to address the following aspects:\n- Methods and tools for the segregation of NEE particle sources: i) during particle collection (e.g., due to high background concentrations), ii) attribution of collected material to different sources. Appropriate real-world test conditions, equipment and sampling methods for the evaluation of particles (e.g., separation of total and solid particles)\n- Source identification and characterization including detailed source apportionment (brake wear, tyre wear, wheel-rail interaction, resuspension, etc.) and chemical composition;\n- Assessment of the influencing parameters: use cases (e.g. different vehicle types or tyre types), conditions (e.g. urban, rural, motorways, tunnels), driving behaviour, state of the road surface or rail tracks; attribution and distribution;\n- Emission Measurement Techniques including but not limited to standardized measurement methods and real-time monitoring;\n- Downstream assessment: analysis of the deposited material in the environment, assessment of its decomposition, aggregation, dispersion and degradation;\n- Health Impact estimates building on existing toxicology studies (or developing new ones if deemed necessary) and long-term exposure effects supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis;\n- Estimates on the environmental impact on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity as well as deposition patterns (i.e. how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas.)\n- Mitigations through focusing on State-of-the-Art systems: test systems (including the vehicle e.g., vehicle-lightweight technologies) that can mitigate non-exhaust emissions to reach TRL 6 or higher, innovative tyre and brake designs and materials that balance durability, safety, and reduced abrasion, innovative road surfaces and texture (considering the interaction between tyre and road), runoff and drainage systems. For the railway sector mitigation solutions could include test systems addressing emissions from key mechanical interfaces (e.g., braking and wheel–rail contact), vehicle innovations to reduce wear-related emissions, and infrastructure measures such as optimized track materials, surface treatments, and improved drainage and containment systems. Consider life cycle assessment for the analysis of the systems\n- Support standardization and regulation based on the recommendations in support of industrial competitiveness\nProposals should take into consideration the results of previous or on-going EU funded projects such as Leon-T , ULTRAHAS , nPETS and LIFE23-ENV-ES-LIFE NEEVE and any other similar projects.",

      "scope": "Climate monitoring of Essential Climate Variables [1] at global and regional scales is crucial to assess the state of our climate, its variability and change, and to track progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the corresponding EU climate objectives. Underlying elements, in particular climate data records, reanalyses and forcings, are fundamental to climate science and serve multiple applications across weather, climate, environmental and sectoral domains, generating societal benefits. In turn, methods to distil information from this wealth of data can help extract relevant knowledge and key messages for climate policymaking.\nProposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:\nA. Next generation climate data records\nActions should advance innovative methods to enhance, expand and update climate data records; exploit recently rescued and/or new data streams; develop innovative methods to improve the water-energy-carbon cycle physical and bio-geochemical consistency across data records; and improve their applicability for users.\nB. Next generation Earth system reanalyses\nActions should undertake research to prepare for the next generation global and European high resolution climate reanalyses. Progress is expected in enhanced data assimilation methods, further coupling the Earth system components, expanding atmospheric composition reanalysis backward in time, piloting carbon-energy-water cycle reanalyses, exploring data-driven methods for reanalyses and applying such improvements in subsequent applications and international initiatives.\nC. Next generation climate forcing and emission data sets\nActions are expected to conduct research to ensure more updated and sustained production, and quality assurance procedures of climate forcings and emissions data sets in support of international climate change assessments and climate simulations, including harmonization between forcing and emission data sets (historical and scenarios).\nAdditionally, all actions should promote the development and use of new, rescued or proxy data streams, and innovative digital tools and methods, including AI-based, to transform climate data into actionable knowledge. These efforts should align with, build upon, and support global intercomparison and coordination frameworks such as CMIP, promoting standardisation, accessibility and utility of climate information across climate science and service user communities, with due consideration of FAIR principles.\nNoting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale.\nResearch areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public.\nInternational cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP [2] , GCOS [3] , and IAMC [4] is strongly encouraged, as well as close coordination and complementarity with Copernicus, Destination Earth, and other relevant stakeholders.\n[1] GCOS Essential Climate Variables\n[2] https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\n[3] https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos\n[4] https://www.iamconsortium.org/",

      "scope": "The development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States rely on the most accurate and decision-useful assessments of climate risks that science can provide. For this purpose, the new knowledge feeding future EUCRAs will be essential. In the first EUCRA assessment, a number of gaps in terms of knowledge and action, and corresponding recommendations are highlighted to underpin more effective EU policy intervention to manage climate risks, stressing the importance of a systemic approach to climate risk assessments, adaptation and resilience and of the interaction with non-climate risk drivers, such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation among others.\nTo support the future EUCRAs and advance adaptation and climate preparedness, actions should improve the understanding and quantification of climate risks, their underlying drivers, and reduce associated uncertainties for different systems and regions. New knowledge should be integrated to assess the risks of wildcards (high impact low probability or black swan events), crossing of tipping points and transboundary, compound and cascading risks in a way that can facilitate decision-making.\nEvidence from recent experiences of materialised climate risks and the performance of adaptation efforts, encompassing the whole range from failure to success and including the role of behavioural aspects, should be mapped and analysed to improve understanding of the key factors that determine effective environmental and social resilience, preparedness and adaptation capacity [2] . However, developing context-specific adaptation strategies is out of the scope of this topic.\nThe main focus is tackling knowledge gaps identified in the EUCRA. Actions should extend and improve the evidence base by retrieving inputs from relevant end-users, including local and regional authorities, and civil society organisations. While general aspects should cover the whole EU, actions should also improve understanding of sub-European and national to local specific risks. Actions should enhance methodologies and tools for risk assessment, making the outputs available through user-oriented EU portals. For these purposes, proposals should:\n- Address at least two systems or sectors (e.g. ecosystems, agri-food, health, infrastructures, energy, water, economy and finance) that interact and have transboundary effects.\n- Include study cases at sub-European scale. While all the cases together should cover the 4 regions defined in EUCRA [3] , some of the individual cases should also address the transnational dimension (i.e. include more than one country of the particular region).\nActions should contribute to future editions of EUCRA. Specific resources should be devoted to this purpose. Actions should leverage recent advances on other climate risk assessments and related frameworks from reliable sources (e.g. the World Climate Research Programme, WCRP).\nActions are encouraged to integrate multiple data sources and to leverage digital technologies, such as AI/ML techniques, tools, and models, including those developed under the European Commission’s Destination Earth initiative, if appropriate.\nCoordination and collaboration with relevant projects from Mission Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 on Climate Science and Responses is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national to local scale assessment, methodological consistency, and cross-fertilisation through project scientific boards; with projects from Cluster 3 Destination Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe for knowledge exchange and better integration of end-user perspectives, and from relevant Destinations in other Clusters. Actions are encouraged to make use of the European research infrastructures including Integrated Research Infrastructure Services for Climate Change Risks [4] , if appropriate.\n[1] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment\n[2] See for instance the report “ Safer together: A path towards a fully prepared Union - European Commission ”\n[3] Northern, Western, Central-eastern and Southern Europe as considered in the EUCRA report.\n[4] https://www.iriscc.eu/",

      "scope": "As emphasized by the IPCC, it is urgent to better understand the benefits and opportunities associated with deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation action to inform strategic decisions. Comprehensive assessments of the socio-economic impacts of climate change are essential for this, however, current approaches face significant challenges with a wide uncertainty in global damage estimates, fragmentation, lack of comparability across methodologies, and reliance on extrapolation from historical data, increasingly unrealistic in the context of current unprecedented changes in the climate system.\nActions should develop and enhance models, methods, and tools to improve the understanding of future socio-economic costs of climate inaction (for the purpose of this topic defined as insufficient, or delayed action), advancing novel approaches and frameworks to address the limitations in existing methodologies, integrating latest scientific evidence, diverse data sources and applicable to various conditions and contexts. In this context, actions are encouraged to leverage emerging digital capabilities, including, if appropriate, those developed under initiatives like Destination Earth. Research should account for the full spectrum of climate impacts, such as those from extreme and low-probability high-impact events and the consequences of trespassing Earth system tipping points, to ensure more comprehensive and accurate assessments. Cascading and compound effects as well as non-market impacts (e.g. health, biodiversity and ecosystems, migration) should be considered. Actions should also contribute to rethinking discount rates and damage functions to better reflect the long-term uncertainty of climate impacts and their implications.\nActions should assess foregone co-benefits and missed opportunities of climate inaction, and their distribution, ranging from health-related gains to economic benefits like business and industrial opportunities, job creation, energy and economic security, innovation and lower costs, as well as environmental and social improvements such as from biodiversity conservation, and reduced inequalities. They should assess increased adaptation needs and costs associated with inadequate mitigation, accelerated climate impacts, lost resilience, crossing of adaptation limits as well as the impact on public budgets [1] . To provide the full picture, the cost of climate inaction should be compared with the cost of ambitious mitigation and adaptation.\nActions should emphasise treatment of uncertainty, ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change. They should explore approaches more compatible with planetary boundaries, going beyond traditional welfare and cost-effectiveness models.\nThis topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant SSH disciplines. Actions should include a process of co-design with stakeholders (e.g., representatives of governments, public administrations, such as civil protection competent authorities, or the private sector) to support uptake of the results.\nProposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:\nArea A: Global\nAnalysis should be global in scale, while also providing regionally resolved insights to enable comparisons across world regions, distinguishing between developing and developed, and duly reflecting diverse circumstances and contexts. International cooperation is generally encouraged and specifically required with low and lower/upper-middle-income countries [2] – particularly major GHG emitters [3] such as China (contributing to the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiative [4] ), India, Brazil and Indonesia. It should enable delivery of robust, representative and widely accepted estimates, and support scientific capacity building where appropriate.\nArea B: The EU\nActions should focus on the EU. Particular attention should be given to consequences for EU industrial performance, security of supply and strategic autonomy.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe.\n[1] For example, the proposals could build upon the joint World Bank and European Commission reports on disaster and climate resilience: Economics for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness\n[2] https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lendinggroups ; standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply - only participants from some of these countries are automatically eligible for funding\n[3] https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgtot#emissions_table\n[4] International cooperation with China in research and innovation",

Such tools and products should be made available for policymakers, companies and the general public to incentivise and equip society to critically assess climate change-related information online and offline.\nResearch is expected to explore how to bridge the gap from climate knowledge and awareness to behavioural change, taking into consideration various factors that shape perceptions across different segments of the society. Actions should generate knowledge and develop innovative, engaging, tailored and multilingual tools, learning techniques, and narratives for impactful climate change communication frameworks at scale. Best-practice examples on European and international level should be retrieved. Climate scientists should be trained to effectively communicate with non-specialist audiences, including policymakers and other stakeholders. Research should investigate how to design and implement targeted communication campaigns that boost climate awareness and preparedness while preventing climate anxiety and counteract disinformation. These campaigns should promote fact-checking, clear and transparent knowledge on climate science and climate policymaking and foster the ability to interpret uncertainties. Citizen engagement, of youth and other vulnerable audiences in particular, is encouraged.\nActions should develop communication strategies, tools and products tailored to real-world context and societal needs, to counter disinformation and enhance climate communication, leveraging visual and digital tools including AI, as appropriate. They should demonstrate clear pathways for uptake and scaling such as piloting with end-users and integration into existing platforms or frameworks.\nThe primary focus of actions should be on Europe, with local and national foci as appropriate, while other regions may be used for framing information. International cooperation is encouraged, especially with the United States [1] and low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding [2] .\nThis research requires a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach drawing on insights from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (SSH) including behavioural sciences and gender, media studies, and communication theory. Participation of the private sector, in particular SME, is also strongly encouraged.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe. Collaboration with the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Climate neutral and Smart Cities is recommended when performing empirical work. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes.\n[1] Standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply – legal entities from the USA are not automatically eligible for funding.\n[2] Please refer to Horizon Europe List of Participating Countries on EU Funding and Tenders Portal for up-to-date information.",

While significant advancements in global weather and climate science have transformed resilience efforts elsewhere, their benefits in Africa remain to be harnessed, to unlock the continent’s ability to address climate challenges more effectively.\nActions should address critical knowledge gaps for improving weather and climate modelling for Africa in the context of changing climate, with focus on the understanding and representation of weather and climate dynamics in Africa at regional, interregional or continental scale. They should enhance models’ predictive skill and reduce uncertainties in key areas such as rainfall and extreme weather events. Actions should harness observational data to advance process-based understanding and model performance across various Earth System components (e.g. land, ocean, atmosphere). This includes improving data collection, assimilation and quality assurance practices, integration of local and rescued historical data to provide high-quality inputs for models. Actions are encouraged to leverage digital technologies, including AI/ML techniques, tools, and models as well as advances in high performance computing to achieve the topic’s goals.\nThe research should be performed in close cooperation and co-creation between African and European teams in a way to ensure relevance, acceptance and co-ownership of solutions by African stakeholders. Actions are also expected to contribute to local capacity-building and knowledge exchange to support competence growth and equip African researchers with the data, tools and expertise necessary to sustain future progress. Strong partnerships should be established between relevant institutions in both regions such as universities, research bodies, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and African Regional Climate Centers (RCCs) [3] to enable mutual learning and collaborations.\nSynergies and complementarity should be sought with other relevant EU-supported initiatives on climate modelling and capacity development in Africa such as Regional Centres of Excellence related to the green transition [4] .

These platforms should incorporate a wide range of data from, for example, whole life carbon assessments, national/international databases of embodied flow coefficients for construction materials and products, Digital Product Passports, Energy Performance Certificates, Smart Readiness Indicators, Building Renovation Passports, and Digital Building Logbooks.\n- Use advanced data analytics and wherever possible existing recognised data standards to exchange data and ensure the interoperability with real-time digital twins and BIM-based models.\n- Validate the proposed platforms in at least three large scale pilots. These pilots must encompass a range of building types (such as residential, commercial, educational, etc.) and address diverse use cases (including energy monitoring, renovation optimization, etc.).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to contribute to the objectives of Built4People, transfer knowledge to its network of innovation clusters [1] and report on results in support of the monitoring of the Built4People KPIs.\n[1] https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/",

      "scope": "The growing energy needs of the ICT sector must be met while aligning with climate neutrality and sustainability goals. Small IT rooms or small data centres are an essential part of the twin green and digital transition. It is important to address the energy and resources consumption over the full ICT value chain. Solutions already exist, such as re-using waste heat from data centres, or moving towards circular models (longer lifetimes, reparability, reuse and recyclability). Most recent analysis suggests that the energy consumption of consumer devices in 2020 accounted for roughly 50% of the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies, with the two next largest contributors being respectively the production of ICT devices (~20%) and the operation of data centres (~15%) [1] . Moreover, this is expected to change dramatically by 2030, as the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies is expected to increase by 50% over this decade. The Commission has set the strategic goal of ensuring that data centres are climate-neutral, energy- and resource efficient by 2030. However, most efforts are directed towards data centres in scope of the Energy Efficiency Directive recast.\nProposals should address all of the following:\n- Demonstrate state-of-the-art holistic and cost-effective approaches to thermal management and excess heat recovery (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade of heat) and re-use in local or nearby site creating effective added value in existing IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres (in the range of 100-500kW, not covered by Energy Efficiency Directive recast), taking into account thermal envelope/building (by means of simulation or digital twins, among others), integration with building automation and control systems and potential to improve the self-assessment and self-optimisation functionalities at all levels, and integration into existing BMS allowing for further development of energy services. Demonstrators should be located in both cold and warm climate Member State or Associated Country to tackle climate specific challenges of thermal management of waste heat.\n- Develop business cases for state-of-the-art solutions for excess heat recovery & re-use (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade), for example by re-using excess heat in an existing system in the building (such as heating or water production purposes), or in a local district heating and cooling network, or in any other local or nearby site creating effective added value to the recovered heat.\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 4 HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-09: Energy efficiency and sustainability of AI data processing in Data Centres (IA) demonstration pilots.\n[1] eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022SC0341",

      "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 defines nature restoration objectives in line with target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The EU Nature Restoration Regulation provides that Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards nature restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings to achieve large-scale impact and foster collaboration between sectors and communities.\nProposals should:\n- support the set up of three living labs, with 10 to 20 experimental sites each, as places for testing and demonstrating innovative solutions to restore ecosystems following three main principles: (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users. Transboundary living labs are encouraged and expected to be in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries, with some of them including outermost regions, islands or remote areas. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the living labs and among the stakeholders within the living labs;\n- establish a work plan of activities in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions;\n- establish tools for each living lab to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and to monitor progress towards the objectives. Where relevant, the overall objective should be to reach the favourable reference areas, the good conservation status and the satisfactory levels for indicators at national levels defined in the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive or the Nature Restoration Regulation;\n- monitor and carry out an assessment of both the effectiveness of innovative practices for ecosystem restoration and for their non-deterioration;\n- demonstrate how of the identified innovative solutions can be viable for end-users, by developing suitable business models and testing private or public support schemes such as payment for ecosystems services or nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] ;\n- address challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions, developing a gender-sensitive and inclusive framework on how ecosystem health could support this work;\n- disseminate the newly developed solutions to facilitate their uptake by practitioners;\n- demonstrate how ecosystem restoration can support EU general policy objectives, enhancing societal resilience, and reducing natural risks.\nProposals should focus on ecosystems under one or several of the following groups:\n- Transitional interfaces : Marine-coastal-terrestrial transitional ecosystems such as salt marshes, dunes, estuaries, coastal lagoons, and deltas, as well as freshwater transitions between watershed, rivers, lakes and groundwater.\n- Urban-rural gradient : urban ecosystems -including parks, restored brownfields, urban forests, and green and blue infrastructures-, urban nature with surrounding peri-urban and rural ecosystems.\n- Mosaic agricultural landscapes : agricultural ecosystems with high biodiversity value such as semi-natural grasslands, agroforestry systems, hedgerows, and buffer strips.\n- Biodiversity corridors : linear habitats that cut across multiple land uses, such as riparian vegetation, roadsides, canal banks, and hedgerows. Ecosystem connectivity across fragmented landscapes.\n- Dryland and arid ecosystems : garrigue, maquis, and steppe landscapes facing increasing threats from drought, erosion, desertification, and fire.\nProjects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors may include researchers, land / water managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), local authorities, civil society representatives (e.g., local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations) and/or investors. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g., land managers, SMEs or civil society) can be provided through calls for proposals. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities.\nCooperation is expected with relevant EU-funded projects and with relevant initiatives of the partnership Biodiversa+, and appropriate resources should be foreseen to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. The collaboration with the JRC would address JRC methodologies for ecosystem condition assessment, aligned with the System of Environmental Economic Accounting, and data and indicators identified by JRC to perform the assessment.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex",

There is a need for systemic, harmonised or standardised biodiversity data at Earth’s surface in order to support AI applications ranging from genome to space and to build up our knowledge on the status and trends of habitats, species, ecosystems, and on the drivers of decline.\nTo address these challenges, proposals should:\n- develop and validate fit-for-purpose multisensory biodiversity data integration systems, to enable omics-based and in-situ data harmonization and integration with remote sensing data from space or sub-orbital platforms, as well as socio-ecological and climatic data for enhancing assessment of ecosystem condition and degradation, and the predictive modelling of biodiversity trends at international, regional and European scales;\n- develop concrete technical capabilities able to answer to diverse use cases, across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in Member States and Associated Countries. To this end, proposals should identify and prioritise critical biodiversity knowledge gaps and their data needs, with a focus on predictive analytics and the use of AI, and address them by designing data integration approaches that support scientific and policy needs, including biodiversity protection, restoration, and sustainable use goals and targets, as well as other related policy objectives;\n- develop demonstration and verification cases focusing on specific ecosystems under the EU ecosystem typology [1] and habitats, including ecotones [2] , identified as those under pressure or as restoration priorities. Proposals should take into account socio-economic pressures and activities impacting ecosystems, including land and sea use and emissions of pollutants (e.g. agriculture, aquaculture, urbanization, resource exploitation and management practices). Demonstration cases should be relevant to EO applications, such as AI-assisted ecosystem and habitat mapping, ensuring interoperability with European and global frameworks such as the Global Ecosystem Typology as well as EUNIS, and aligned with reporting requirements under the Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive and EU Nature Restoration Regulation;\n- deliver FAIR data, harmonisation workflows and processing protocols supporting data integration from genome to space and verify the use of generated datasets on identified analysis needs. Proposals should link observation data to emerging socio-economic, climate, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and environmental data and to relevant data infrastructures, including, if applicable, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Common Data Spaces and SAGE [3] ;\n- contribute to consensus and implementation of joint definitions of data collection, metadata and processing protocols, data quality and harmonization of standards enabling the integration of observations “from genomes to space”.\nProposals should earmark resources for cooperation with existing initiatives such as in-situ data collection frameworks (e.g., GBIF, OBIS, LUCAS).The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may join the selected consortium in relation to effective coordination with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service, as well as incorporating the in-situ data from European Commission steered biodiversity monitoring schemes such as LUCAS, specifically LUCAS grassland, and EMBAL (European Monitoring of Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes). Proposals may consider services offered by European research infrastructures [4] .\nThis topic is part of the Biodiversity cluster of the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative (ESSI). Proposals should foresee sufficient mean for effective coordination with projects selected under ESA’s FuturEO programme.\n[1] The “EU ecosystem typology” is a classification of ecosystem types developed by the Commission and the European Environmental Agency, in collaboration with Member States and it is tailored to meet EU needs. Its first level is legislated and is used for the reporting under in Annex IX of Regulation (EU) 691/2011.\n[2] Ecotones are areas of steep transition between ecological communities, ecosystems, and/or ecological regions along an environmental or other gradient.

      "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- effective scientific support is provided by the Science Service for Biodiversity to all levels of policymaking related to biodiversity, through the European Commission’s Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD); in particular, the coordination of answering ad hoc policy requests related to biodiversity through the mobilisation of the EU-funded scientific community, in collaboration with the KCBD, is expected;\n- enhanced science-policy support and knowledge transfer from EU-funded R&I projects to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are ensured;\n- a strengthened, multi-stakeholder knowledge and dialogue platform promotes biodiversity knowledge and the uptake and scaling of nature-based solutions (NbS) including for nature protection and restoration across the EU and beyond, through active engagement with practitioners, developers, and decision-makers from science, policy, business, and civil society - at local, national, and international levels.",
      "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 includes a science-policy mechanism and greater efforts to support the implementation of biodiversity commitments at EU and global levels. The strategy also explicitly calls for the use of NbS as a central component in addressing both biodiversity loss and climate change. In line with the Commission’s priority 'A global Europe’, the EU is demonstrating leadership in this field, notably by enhancing its support to the multilateral processes and platforms addressing the biodiversity crisis. This topic covers essential functions of the Science Service for Biodiversity, broader science-policy support for multiple actors in relation to the global IPBES and CBD processes, as well as support to collaborations and knowledge exchange specifically on NbS. The Science Service, linked to the KCBD, plays a critical role in supporting evidence-based decision making within the EU. In addition, the KCBD acts as one of the European Technical and Scientific Support Centres (TSCs) established under the CBD, which support knowledge transfer and capacity building to help CBD Parties implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).\nProposals should:\n- support the provision of a functional Science Service for Biodiversity, in close collaboration with the KCBD, acting as a one-stop-shop – a single-entry point for providing the overall support on evidence-based services (answering knowledge requests, tools, coordination, capacity building) that enable policymakers, other decision makers and stakeholders in Europe and beyond to ensure the protection, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity. Successful proposals should: provide high-quality evidence-based responses to biodiversity-related policy requests submitted to the KCBD, by involving relevant researchers, particularly those from EU-funded projects. Proposals are expected to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts; maintain and extend active knowledge exchange networks, including through capacity building, to strengthen the bridge between policy, science and society; maintain, enrich and expand a set of Science Service tools, enabling all relevant actors to use and benefit from the best available biodiversity knowledge;\n- strengthen the capacity of researchers and negotiators from the EU and Associated Countries to engage in IPBES and CBD processes. Successful proposals should: provide scientific and back-office support to negotiators involved in these processes; facilitate and support the engagement of researchers from the EU and Associated Countries in these processes. Proposals are expected to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts; facilitate technical and scientific cooperation, knowledge transfer and networking between researchers, stakeholders, policymakers and other decision makers to enhance awareness and application of IPBES deliverables; support the KCBD in its tasks as a European TSC mobilising and/or generating evidence and knowledge to implement the GBF.\n- enhance and expand dynamic knowledge exchange mechanisms on NbS, coupled with targeted capacity-building initiatives, to reinforce the interface between policy, scientific research, business and societal engagement. Successful proposals should also: ensure a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform on NbS serves to bridge science, policy, practice, and business, fostering the co-creation, dissemination, and uptake of research-based knowledge. This platform should play a key role in promoting policy coherence, encouraging collaborative action, and building capacity among Member States and Associated Countries, communities, and actors at all levels.\nSuccessful proposals should support the new Commission policy priorities for 2024-2029 with a focus on “Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature”. This implies support to the implementation of the goals of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the GBF and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This requires interactions with IPBES, the CBD Secretariat, and the EC via the KCBD. Knowledge generated under this topic is also expected to inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy after 2030.\nProposals should build on existing knowledge and the results of past and on-going projects, and foresee close collaboration with, and tailored support to the KCBD and its Science Service. The possible participation of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the project would facilitate this collaboration and support. Proposals should also foresee cooperation with the European Biodiversity Partnership (Biodiversa+) and its funded projects. Proposal aspects addressing the platform on NbS should build upon the foundations and outcomes of the NetworkNaturePLUS project.\nProposals are strongly encouraged to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, respond to biodiversity-related policy requests or engage relevant expertise in IPBES and CBD processes. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define a fair and transparent selection process for third parties, for which financial support may be granted. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the project will support the engagement of leading researchers from the EU and Associated Countries in IPBES and CBD processes.\nThe Plan for exploitation and dissemination should ensure the valorisation of available knowledge to policy makers, stakeholders and the public.",

      "scope": "Ecosystem restoration strategies for nature restoration and climate change mitigation require a coordinated and coherent set of human interventions and management practices (e.g. temporal protection of plants or removing invasive species, including their seeds) for which there is usually no dedicated mean like specific machinery, equipment or other technical innovations (like for example specific lures for invasive alien species). The most common practice is the use of agricultural machinery or equipment, but this is not always effective.\nWith target 4 of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU took the following commitments: significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored; habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend. According to the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, at least 20 % of land areas and at least 20 % of sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. This is reflected in target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in which they should promote Nature-based Solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation. These policies and legislations have reached the implementation stage in the EU and worldwide.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n- design, develop and test technical innovations corresponding to identified needs for specific ecosystems protection and/or restoration activities. A wide range of possible innovations can be proposed, including new or adapted machines, low techs, digital innovations or combinations of them to be used in a wide range of ecosystem types, including terrestrial, freshwater and marine;\n- pay attention to effectiveness, simplicity of use, durability and environmental sustainability and responsibility (including alertness to potential risks, trade-offs and the unintended consequences as a result of the use of technological innovations).\nThis topic is particularly relevant for SMEs.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.",

      "scope": "Invasive alien species are one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. Besides inflicting major damage to nature and the economy, many invasive alien species also facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and native wildlife. The rate of new introductions of invasive alien species has increased in recent years. Without effective control measures, risks to our nature and health will continue to rise. Climate change and land-use changes facilitate the spread and establishment of many alien species.\nProposals are expected to support the prevention, eradication and/or management of invasive alien species by stakeholders, including adaptive management approaches. This topic is related to target 12 the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species) and to target 6 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: reduce the introduction of Invasive Alien Species by 50% by 2030 and minimize their impact. Proposals should support the implementation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the EU regulation on invasive alien species and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the IPBES assessment on invasive alien species (2023) [1] . All ecosystem types (terrestrial, fresh and/or marine waters) may be addressed.\nLiving labs can empower the green transition by co-creating solutions and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.\nSuccessful proposals should:\n- set up at least three living labs, composed each of 10 to 20 experimental sites, following the three main principles: (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users. Transboundary living labs are encouraged and living labs are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries;\n- establish a detailed work plan of the activities to be undertaken in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions. Where appropriate, activities should advance knowledge on invasive alien species to support the development of solutions;\n- conduct participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs with the objectives of: building on existing methods (including ensuring the integration of existing solutions) or developing new ones for detecting and monitoring invasive alien species, such as the use of citizen science, eDNA, remote sensing and machine learning algorithms, and test them at scale. Proposals could build on pilots developed by the European partnership Biodiversa+; designing and testing innovative eradication and management strategies and methods which may include, for instance, physical removal and the use of biological control or chemical control. Innovative tools such as bio-engineering might be explored in conjunction with more traditional methods. Range shifts induced by climate change should be considered;\n- monitor and carry out an assessment of the innovative strategies, methods and tools and their effectiveness. Measures to ensure the prevention of re-invasion should be considered as well, to secure the continued effectiveness of the proposed solutions;\n- disseminate the newly developed solutions, to facilitate their uptake by practitioners;\n- provide data and experience usable for decision-makers, to assess socio-economic impacts of invasive alien species, side-effects of the management, the cost of inaction and the benefits of eradication or effective management, with effective contribution from social sciences and humanities;\n- address challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions. A gender-sensitive and inclusive approach should be integrated, examining how invasive alien species affect individuals’ livelihoods and well-being differently.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline to enhance the societal impact of the research activities.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly for real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to store and give access to research data should be considered. A citizen science approach could be appropriate for this action to produce, collect and analyse data.\nFinancial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nProposals should cooperate with the Joint Research Centre to use the resources of and make results available to, when relevant, the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN).\nProposals should ensure cooperation with relevant initiatives of the European partnership Biodiversa+ and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] as well as related projects in the environment domain.

Leveraging synergies in business action on climate to strengthen overall resilience also needs to be considered;\n- policy and decision makers benefit from improved knowledge to drive transformative policy including fiscal reforms to align economic incentives with nature positive investments and scalable biodiversity finance mechanisms (including blended finance, green bonds, nature credits, ecosystem service markets, etc.);\n- to ensure clear evaluation frameworks for effectiveness, policy and decision makers have access to improved measurement and reporting of economic and business impacts, dependencies, and efforts on biodiversity.",
      "scope": "Current economic systems are often driven by growth models and competitive pressures that prioritise short-term profits and speed over the long-term health of ecosystems. These systems also fail to account for environmental externalities, making nature positive solutions appear less affordable than they truly are. This has led to the exploitation of natural resources, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity, which in turn has significant negative impacts on both the environment and human well-being. Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services is not just important, it is essential to preserving life on Earth, as they underpin the very systems that sustain all human and natural life. As these systems continue, the consequences are becoming increasingly clear: climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, pollution and species extinction, all of which undermine the foundations of human society, business, and future prosperity. A nature positive economy, on the other hand, focuses on restoring and enhancing the natural systems that support life on Earth, ultimately benefiting and improving the resilience of our economy.\nThe topic should work to achieve the objectives and the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the ‘Roadmap towards nature Credits’, EU Sustainable Finance Policy including the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF, and notably targets 14, 15, 18 and 19) and the Task Force on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\nProposals should:\n- support decision-making for a nature positive economy by addressing knowledge and practice gaps, advancing transparent and standardised biodiversity metrics, improving accessibility of assessment methods and data, integrating economic risks related to biodiversity loss into corporate strategies and reporting. Where possible lessons learned should inform and scale-up initiatives to achieve a nature positive economy also beyond the European context;\n- improve the knowledge on effective biodiversity incentives including through fiscal reforms and phasing out harmful subsidies to support the development of policies and financial strategies for nature positive investments;\n- pilot innovative financial mechanisms and valuation approaches in real-world business contexts, including instruments for mobilising private finance such as nature credits, to strengthen the business case for biodiversity protection, restoration and sustainable use, including through Nature-based Solutions;\n- carry out demonstration actions to help integrate research into policy and practice and to demonstrate operational pathways for long term transformative change and for the acceleration of nature positive economy;\n- use and build on available biodiversity data sources, including from biodiversity monitoring schemes, for the purpose of developing corporate strategies and sustainability metrics in the private sector. This includes considering the potential of AI;\n- develop, analyse and/or promote ways of making sustainability reporting more accessible, efficient, and accurate for businesses of all sizes and particularly for start-ups and SMEs, with a view to promote an equitable and manageable compliance framework. Leveraging AI, digital automation and sector specific insights is encouraged.\nProposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate, provide recommendations to policy makers.\nProposals should create synergies with and build on results of other relevant EU-funded projects on biodiversity, economics and finance, and ensure cooperation with the European partnership Biodiversa+. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. Proposals should also foresee links with voluntary market initiatives, e.g., the TNFD or others. Proposals must follow a multi-actor approach, engaging researchers, businesses, financial institutions, public authorities, policy makers, and civil society to co-develop and apply solutions.\n[1] For more information on nature-based enterprises please refer to page 6 and 8 of the European Commission Expert Publication (2022): The vital role of nature-based solutions in a nature positive economy: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/85aeb571-c69c-11ec-b6f4-01aa75ed71a1",

      "scope": "As nature positive actions gain momentum and biodiversity is increasingly integrated into policies, it is essential to ensure governance frameworks can support large-scale, coordinated implementation. Relevant stakeholders should be actively involved in shaping new solutions adapted to different and local contexts.\nLiving labs have the potential to empower a green transition and a transformative change towards nature positive society and economy by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings to achieve large-scale impact and foster collaboration between sectors and communities.\nProposals should align with key policies including the European Green Deal and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), the Paris Agreement, the European Climate Law and the One Health approach.\nProposals should:\n- establish living labs as real-world testing environments to experiment with policy solutions, stakeholder engagement, and new economic models, while strengthening collective capacities and well-being, and identifying and overcoming barriers that limit participation in living labs;\n- develop inclusive, intersectional and adaptive governance strategies that foster systemic transformative change, based on both biodiversity and socio-economic metrics and emphasising equity and sustainability.\nIn particular, actions are expected to:\n- conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of policies related to both direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, with the aim of identifying conflicting or competing objectives and informing more coherent, nature positive policy frameworks;\n- analyse the legal, financial and institutional barriers to inclusive governance in Europe, including the assessment of political and economic obstacles and of active strategies by actors and develop proposals to pilot and test innovative policy instruments, such as citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgeting and, if and when relevant, nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] , to foster transformative change;\n- develop multi-level governance models and policy proposals to integrate all relevant nature positive actions (including protection and restoration of ecosystems, Nature-based Solutions, circular economy, sustainable bioeconomy, regenerative agriculture, agroecology, agroforestry, bioremediation, etc.) into all relevant EU policies and strategies in a synergetic and coherent way;\n- identify relevant existing EU funded communities of practices, such as the Nature-based Solutions hubs, the circular economy hubs and the adaptation hubs, and group them per ecosystem or societal challenge;\n- set-up living labs to co-develop enabling pathways for transformative change and test them to ensure positive impacts on the ground, drawing on best practices (including emerging nature positive actions), identifying knowledge gaps and addressing research and innovation needs in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders;\n- develop digital tools to synthesise and visualise diverse knowledge sources and create decision-support systems for inclusive governance, in view to inform all stakeholders about all existing nature positive actions per ecosystem or societal challenge and to propose the best options in terms of both biodiversity and socio-economic gains for a specific and/or local context (e.g. surface area, available budget, main challenge, specific regional area).\nProposals should address Area A: living labs per ecosystem (marine, freshwater, terrestrial (including agriculture, forestry, cities)) or Area B: living labs per societal challenge (climate change, water, food, health, pollution, spatial planning). The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nProposals should ensure close collaboration with the other project selected under this topic. They should also offer training for policymakers, community leaders, and researchers on co-governance and knowledge integration and develop educational materials and ensure coordination and exchanges between all living labs. Proposals should adopt interdisciplinary approaches and ensure policymakers, business leaders and stakeholders co-create, experiment, and validate new solutions in an open, user-centred way.\nSolutions should be adapted to the environmental, socio-economic, and cultural contexts of each living lab, considering both cultural and natural heritage. Scaling and transferability challenges should be addressed through collaborative approaches combining scientific knowledge with local expertise. In this respect, particular attention could be paid to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions. The gender dimension should also be integrated.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving a range of stakeholders, including when relevant farmers, foresters and land managers, fishing and aquaculture communities, spatial planners and landscape architects, tourism actors, water governance bodies, business leaders, energy producers, local authorities, NGOs and youth organisations, to ensure that the knowledge and needs from various sectors are integrated and the results are impactful.\nProposals should seek to address knowledge gaps identified by IPBES assessments and, if relevant, provide recommendations to policymakers. They should build on existing knowledge from and ensure complementarity with other relevant EU-funded projects under Horizon Europe Work Programmes [2] , including Biodiversa+ and NetworkNaturePLUS, and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines to collect and validate both technical and socio-economic data.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] EU-funded projects leading the way to transformative change for biodiversity - European Commission , https://erc.europa.eu/projects-statistics/mapping-erc-frontier-research/frontier-research-transformative-change and https://www.biodiversa.eu/2024/06/11/2024-2025-joint-call/",

The progress of public authorities and policymakers towards a comprehensive One Health governance is assessed, thanks to the development of science-based indicators.",
      "scope": "The One Health approach recognises the inherent connection between the health of ecosystems, wildlife, humans, domestic animals and plants. This approach is key to prevent, anticipate, detect and respond to health threats across sectors. It has the potential to reduce the impact and societal and economic costs of such threats and prevent their emergence, while also reducing pressures on the environment, contributing to food security and ensuring access to clean air and water.\nProposals should support the objectives and the implementation of the EU Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Global Action Plan on Biodiversity and Health [1] . Proposals should seek the mainstreaming of the One Health approach, address the knowledge gaps identified by IPBES assessments, and provide policy recommendations.\nProposals should:\n- describe the current health status of the ecosystems and wild species most susceptible to interact with human health (including terrestrial, freshwater and marine ones, with no geographical restrictions). Describe the impact of the stressors induced by the drivers of biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem dynamics on their health, meaning their physiology, genetic diversity, population distribution and ecology. Taking into consideration the most updated scientific scenarios (e.g. IPBES nexus assessment), predict the future health status of these ecosystems and wild species in the short, mid and long term;\n- propose benchmark protocols to ensure comparability between research communities (including social sciences and humanities) and define common indicators describing the risks (e.g. loss of ecosystem services, exposure to pollutants and pathogens) and benefits (e.g. dilution effect, exposure to beneficial microorganisms, etc.) of the interlinkages of wild species and ecosystem health, domestic animal and plant health and human health. This includes the integration of ecosystem and wildlife health in the exposome approach;\n- assess the impacts of the degradation of ecosystem and wildlife health on human health, including a cost-benefit analysis of nature restoration and conservation projects in terms of human health benefits and the costs of inaction. This should include disability and intersectional aspects and the groups in the most vulnerable situations in society (e.g. low-income communities, youth, older people, persons with disabilities, LGBTIQ people, people with racial or religious minority background). Based on this, provide actionable policy recommendations for policymakers and authorities in establishing a One Health policy framework.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service and ensure cooperation with the EU Biodiversa+ and Animal Health and Welfare partnerships [2] . Proposals should also build on the relevant previous Horizon Europe projects.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\n[1] https://www.cbd.int/health/GAP.shtml\n[2] European Partnership on Animal Health and Welfare",

      "scope": "Maintaining and improving farmland bird populations is crucial for both conservation and the long-term sustainability of food production systems. Farmland birds and mammals provide valuable ecosystem services, such as pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal, which are essential for resilient agriculture. Focusing on birds ensures the preservation of these services, while also contributing to broader biodiversity goals. Additionally, including farmland mammals in the research helps assess potential synergies and trade-offs in pest control, providing a more holistic ecological understanding. As farmland birds and mammals can cause damage by consuming crops, it is important that research seeks the correct equilibrium between the utility of these animals and the damage they can cause. This broader perspective allows for more informed decisions on how to design farming systems that are not only beneficial to bird populations but also support the protection and restoration of healthy ecosystems. Overall, the objective is to foster sustainable agriculture that enhances both productivity and biodiversity, and offers opportunities for nature restoration.\nProposals should:\n- synthetize the impact of various farming practices on both farmland bird populations and agricultural productivity, while also considering farmland mammals for a more comprehensive picture. Also, assessing the role and impact of specific bird species in pest control and soil health to better understand their contributions in agricultural landscapes and to the sustainability of farming systems;\n- develop participatory research programs that encourage landscape-level collaboration among farmers, land managers, and conservationists. These programs should focus on identifying and testing locally tailored bird-friendly solutions while addressing farmers' perceptions, needs, and challenges in adopting these practices;\n- improve existing incentives (also under CAP), or potentially create new targeted ones to promote the adoption of bird- and mammal-friendly solutions. These incentives should be geographically relevant and designed to address farmers' specific challenges, while fostering collaboration among farmers, land managers, and conservationists to ensure effective implementation and long-term sustainability;\n- design a comprehensive farmer education program focused on bird-friendly practices and their economic benefits. This should include advisory services with ecologists, field days, and demonstration farms showcasing successful bird-focused measures in profitable farming systems. Also assess effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning networks and highlight the economic co-benefits of these practices (e.g., pest reduction and pollination);\n- conduct research to assess the effectiveness of scaling proven biodiversity-friendly farming practices, such as creating and preserving semi-natural habitats of farmland or other farming practices and in consideration of at least maintaining productivity. Focus on successful models, that can be applied to different regions, and evaluate their impact on bird and selected mammal populations.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and Target 10 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving a range of stakeholders, particularly farmers and land managers, to ensure that the knowledge and needs from various sectors are integrated and the results are impactful.\nProposals should, where relevant, build on previous EU and nationally funded projects, including Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and LIFE, and the Agroecology Partnership; and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

      "scope": "Plant breeding has focused on maximising yield in single species stands for monocropping systems, leading to highly productive yet specialised varieties. As a result, most varieties on the market may not perform well in intercropping systems, where productivity and benefits often depend on the interactions between crops. To support farming practices that promote agrobiodiversity, there is a need to develop varieties specifically adapted to intercropping. However, selecting varieties specifically for intercropping remains a practical challenge for breeding.\nProposals should:\n- provide novel insights into interactions and mechanisms that influence intercrop performance by advancing understanding of plant traits affecting both inter- and intraspecific interactions and their impact on crop outcomes. The approach should consider eco-physiological processes [1] and ideally encompass both aboveground crop interactions and belowground dynamics between intercropped roots and soil organisms;\n- develop new organic breeding approaches that prioritise enhancing crop performance within multi-species systems, emphasising the importance of competition, complementarity and facilitation mechanisms between crops;\n- identify crop combinations and superior–performing variety combinations that consistently yield well together;\n- provide inputs for the development of future testing and selection criteria, as well as tools and methods for evaluating the performance of specialized genotypes in intercropping conditions, laying the groundwork for breeders and bodies entrusted to establish these frameworks.\nParticular attention should be given to aspects related to the regulations for the use and development of Organic Heterogeneous Material (OHM) and/or Organic Varieties Suitable for Organic Production (OVSOP) as innovative categories of plant reproductive material.\nIf applicable, proposal may advance pre-existing breeding material towards the development of OHM and/or OVSOP for intercropping, making use of the knowledge and tools developed within the project.\nProposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe and ensure collaboration with relevant ongoing projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructure [2] in the environment, biological and food domains.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate the new organic breeding approaches for intercropping.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, to the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [3] , to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (notably target 8) and to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (target 10).\n[1] biological and physiological mechanisms that plants undergo to interact with the surrounding physical, chemical and biological environments when cultivated in an intercrop system (e.g. nutrient/water uptake, root structure, interactions with insects/pollinators, disease incidents).\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

      "scope": "This topic supports the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). It builds on a series of CCRI-related topics funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and replicated every one to two programming year since 2021. The goal is to accelerate place-based innovation, boost skills and capacities and support the implementation of solutions for a circular systemic transition at city or region level. Implementing circular systemic solutions reduces environmental impacts and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by decreasing the extraction of primary raw materials and minimizing waste generation.\nThis topic specifically focuses on moving from demonstration to further deployment and upscaling through the setup of well-functioning real-life innovation ecosystem, such as living labs. This topic targets public local and regional authorities (or their groupings) in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Proposed living labs should enable systematic participation of all ecosystem stakeholder in targeted cities and regions to co-create solutions that are practical, relevant, and readily applicable. These stakeholders include citizens, policymakers, research bodies, academia, industries, start-ups and SMEs, social economy entities and financial intermediaries. In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach to involve end-users. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics. Proposals should set up engaging and effective governance structures, facilitate collaboration and coordination, and ensure continuous feedback and monitoring to enable an iterative and flexible process. Proposals should integrate systemic socio-ecological approaches and involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g., economics, politics, sociology, psychology, gender studies).\nProposals should support the validation, testing and optimisation of innovative, circular systemic solutions in selected cities/regions (the ‘demonstrators’), along with relevant governance models and business plans. This CCRI-related topic does not target specific technologies or industrial sectors but supports a place-based approach. This means that proposals should select their targeted sector(s) and/or value chain(s), based on a detailed analysis of the local/regional contexts and specific circular potentials.\nProposals should facilitate knowledge and experience transfer for further outreach and large scale replication across Europe. Proposals should turn their insights into actionable recommendations, identifying the lessons learned, specifying the enabling framework, main barriers and enablers, business case, and other relevant factors for successful replication and upscaling in other cities and/or regions (the ‘replicators’).\nAt least two different demonstration and three replication ‘living labs’ (incl. cities/regions – possibly together with their public and/or private ecosystem partners in their territory) must be part of the consortium. One out of the three replication labs must be located in Horizon Europe widening countries (including Outermost Regions).\nProposals should clearly specify how they will ensure synergies and complementarities with other relevant circular economy projects and initiatives, including those recognised as CCRI Projects [1] and CCRI Associated Partners [2] . In that sense, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the CCRI office, projects and partners (e.g. thematic discussion groups, joint events, joint R&I gap analysis and policy briefs). Clustering and dissemination activities will be facilitated and supported by the CCRI Coordination and Support Office to ease knowledge exchange, foster solution replication and uptake, and maximise impact.\nThis topic contributes to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal, in particular the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP), as well as the new EU bioeconomy strategy. It also supports the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy by fostering placed-based (social, technological and non-technological) innovation to make European cities and regions more circular, resilient and competitive.\nLinkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission should be explored – whenever relevant.\n[1] List of CCRI Projects from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects .

      "scope": "The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand in clean tech and energy-intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll-out of clean energy and manufacturing, to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 2026-2027 work programme supports fit-for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus exclusively on clean tech and energy-intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n- implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

      "scope": "The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand in clean tech and energy-intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll-out of clean energy and manufacturing, to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 2026-2027 work programme supports fit-for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus exclusively on clean tech and energy-intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n- implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

      "scope": "Electrical and electronic equipment continues to be one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with current annual growth rates of 2%. It is estimated that less than 40% of electronic waste is collected in the EU. [1] Value is lost when fully or partially functional products are discarded because they are not reparable, the battery cannot be replaced, the software is no longer supported, or materials incorporated in devices are not recovered.\nIncreasing recovery of critical raw materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment is a strategic priority to mitigate supply risks. Today, CRM recovery rates are generally low, with increases requiring new recovery processes and interface optimisation with pre-processing to ensure appropriate material flows for efficient recovery are generated. [2]\nProposals should:\n- develop, test and demonstrate new or improved ecodesign of consumer electronics, including design for durability, reusability, reparability, disassembly, separability, recyclability, uptake of recycled content. This may include design solutions for the reuse of components and for easier dismantling leading to increased reparability, remanufacturing or recycling with use of solutions and technologies such as active disassembly/debonding materials and adhesives, and design solutions targeting critical and strategic raw materials;\n- assess and provide recommendations for mechanisms and incentives to address the trade-offs with costs and innovation limitations and to reward design for circularity and product durability – such as extended guarantees, “second” VAT reduction, or others –, and test and demonstrate new business models such as leasing and product-service-systems, to the extent that they reinforce positive design changes.\nProposed solutions need to be aligned with chemical safety principles (SSbD) and in compliance with relevant legislation such as RoHS. The environmental performance of the proposed solutions in comparison to existing products should be evaluated from a lifecycle perspective using product environmental footprint methodology wherever applicable. Participation of partners from (associated) countries with actual electronics production is encouraged. Participation of SMEs is encouraged. Consumer benefits are at the centre of this topic, and it is vital that the consumer perspective is duly reflected in all activities. The topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nThis topic supports the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, in particular with a view to the reparability of small household appliances, the WEEE Directive, contribute to waste prevention, higher circularity and uptake of recyclate, and Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/f4c7be39-efa9-4beb-88e0-4c5fdd37de7b?lang=en\n[2] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092134492030241X",

      "scope": "This topic supports the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). It builds on a series of CCRI-related topics funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and replicated every one to two programming year since 2021. The goal is to accelerate place-based innovation, boost skills and capacities and support the implementation of solutions for a circular systemic transition at city or region level. Implementing circular systemic solutions reduces environmental impacts and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by decreasing the extraction of primary raw materials and minimizing waste generation.\nThis topic specifically focuses on moving from demonstration to further deployment and upscaling through the setup of well-functioning real-life innovation ecosystem, such as living labs. This topic targets public local and regional authorities (or their groupings) in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Proposed living labs should enable systematic participation of all ecosystem stakeholder in targeted cities and regions to co-create solutions that are practical, relevant, and readily applicable. These stakeholders include citizens, policymakers, research bodies, academia, industries, start-ups and SMEs, social economy entities and financial intermediaries. In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach to involve end-users. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics. Proposals should set up engaging and effective governance structures, facilitate collaboration and coordination, and ensure continuous feedback and monitoring to enable an iterative and flexible process. Proposals should integrate systemic socio-ecological approaches and involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g., economics, politics, sociology, psychology, gender studies).\nProposals should support the validation, testing and optimisation of innovative, circular systemic solutions in selected cities/regions (the ‘demonstrators’), along with relevant governance models and business plans. This CCRI-related topic does not target specific technologies or industrial sectors but supports a place-based approach. This means that proposals should select their targeted sector(s) and/or value chain(s), based on a detailed analysis of the local/regional contexts and specific circular potentials.\nProposals should facilitate knowledge and experience transfer for further outreach and large scale replication across Europe. Proposals should turn their insights into actionable recommendations, identifying the lessons learned, specifying the enabling framework, main barriers and enablers, business case, and other relevant factors for successful replication and upscaling in other cities and/or regions (the ‘replicators’).\nAt least two different demonstration and three replication ‘living labs’ (incl. cities/regions – possibly together with their public and/or private ecosystem partners in their territory) must be part of the consortium. One out of the three replication labs must be located in Horizon Europe widening countries (including Outermost Regions).\nProposals should clearly specify how they will ensure synergies and complementarities with other relevant circular economy projects and initiatives, including those recognised as CCRI Projects [1] and CCRI Associated Partners [2] . In that sense, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the CCRI office, projects and partners (e.g. thematic discussion groups, joint events, joint R&I gap analysis and policy briefs). Clustering and dissemination activities will be facilitated and supported by the CCRI Coordination and Support Office to ease knowledge exchange, foster solution replication and uptake, and maximise impact.\nThis topic contributes to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal, in particular the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP), as well as the new EU bioeconomy strategy. It also supports the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy by fostering placed-based (social, technological and non-technological) innovation to make European cities and regions more circular, resilient and competitive.\nLinkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission should be explored – whenever relevant.\n[1] List of CCRI Projects from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects .

Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n- Implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

      "scope": "The local character of biomass and other biological resources and the high number of micro-companies and SMEs involved in sectors that deal with biological resources explain why research and innovations are best developed in line with the local and regional context. “Places” (geographical defined areas as defined in the previous footnote) play an important role in the transition to a sustainable and circular EU bioeconomy and have proven to act as a good platform for matching EU top-level policies and best practices with bottom-up entrepreneurship and innovation that is mobilised to meet an ambition and vision for the bioeconomy. Bioeconomy places are expected to lead the transition to a sustainable and circular bioeconomy by building their capacity to develop and deploy innovative bioeconomy solutions within a clearly defined local/regional governance framework and vision that is aligned to EU priorities and policies.\nProposals should:\n- develop definitions of and benchmarks that can allow to qualify a “Place” as “Bioeconomy Place” (i.e. a label to be awarded to “Places” that meet the definitions and benchmarks developed as part of the project), linked to and built upon the groundwork laid by the Regional Innovation Valleys (RIVs) for Bioeconomy and Food Systems , the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) [2] and other relevant projects. They should relate to the ability of the place to fulfil environmental (including biodiversity), social and economic sustainability criteria using bioeconomy solutions (e.g. including Nature-based Solutions), with particular attention to the sustainability of sourced biomass, climate mitigation, biodiversity protection circularity, food systems, social fairness and competitiveness.\n- set up at least three “Bioeconomy Place” pilot sites, which are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States/Associated Countries. At least one of the pilot sites should be located fully or partially in Ukraine. In these sites, proposals should: carry out an analysis on needs, strengths and opportunities that should include but is not limited to infrastructure (analysing physical and digital conditions for bioeconomy industrial clusters to be established), value chains (e.g. biomass sourcing mapping and industrial capacity mapping, with particular attention to SMEs and start-ups), consumer and civil society needs and awareness, skill readiness and devise, for each pilot site, a plan with commitments to transform the “Place” into a “Bioeconomy Place”, based on the analysis and benchmarks developed. These plans should: foster multi-stakeholder partnerships with local actors, taking into account a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations; establish synergies between urban, rural (where relevant, coastal) areas to optimise resource flows and promote the creation of new business models, value chains and jobs; develop training programmes that enhance technical and entrepreneurial skills, including biotechnology and digital skills relevant to the bioeconomy; provide capacity-building for bioeconomy stakeholders on access to funding and capital and on how to prepare bankable projects and attract private capital; and provide policy recommendations on how to progress in the deployment of bioeconomy solutions ensuring circularity.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving educational and employment institutions, industrial actors, unions and local and regional authorities in order to co-create the knowledge and adapted solutions to foster the establishment of Bioeconomy Places across Europe. Collaboration among all the pilot sites set up under the projects of this topic should be fostered. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate and advance the knowledge and findings from previously funded EU projects [3] and work with projects from topics under this WP. All projects under this topic need to closely collaborate.\n[1] For the purposes of this topic, Bioeconomy Places are understood as geographically-defined areas (such as regions, their sub-entities, groups of municipalities, rural or urban, including cross-border) where bioeconomy solutions are used for sustainable prosperity and community well-being considering the specific needs, strengths and potential of each place.\n[2] Both the RIV and CCRI initiatives have already tested place-based circular bioeconomy solutions, fostering local innovation ecosystems and stakeholder collaboration. \"Bioeconomy places\" can leverage these established networks and lessons learned to scale up successful models, tailor solutions to regional strengths, and ensure coherence across EU territories in delivering a resilient and sustainable bioeconomy.\n[3] For example, projects funded under H2020-RUR-09-2018, HORIZON-CL6-2021-CIRCBIO-01-08, HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01-7, HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01-10 and H2020_RUR-09-2018.",

      "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- enhanced capacity of private and public stakeholders to increase resource efficiency in collecting, processing and using primary and secondary biomass, ensuring that ecosystems and biodiversity are protected and restored, emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants reduced, and human needs for biomass satisfied in sufficient and fair way, including food security;\n- increased environmental, social and economic value added from the various uses of biomass, including bio-waste, e.g. food losses and food waste;\n- reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and (air, water and soil) pollution, due to avoiding landfilling and incineration of bio-waste;\n- demonstrated environmental, social and economic and social benefits for the municipalities involved in the collection and provision of bio-waste.",
      "scope": "Successful proposals should contribute to the implementation of the new EU bioeconomy strategy and its action plan; and the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive, e.g. on bio-waste management. Project outcomes will contribute to the objectives of the recent initiatives on Circular Economy, Biotechnology, Competitiveness, the Clean Industrial Deal, the Vision for Agriculture and Food and Life Sciences.\nBioeconomy provides solutions to various challenges. However, companies see themselves challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are solutions to increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the demand, e.g. better valorise unused/under-exploited sustainable biomass resources (including unavoidable food waste and industrial residues), and degraded land, apply new breeding techniques and increase resource efficiency through circular design and circular business and consumption models.\nBio-waste represents a vast underutilised biomass resource with substantial potential for valorisation. Private and public actors that aggregate biomass waste streams, pretreat them and standardise them for further valorisation are well placed to foster its improved use. In addition, they play an essential role to increase the transparency of biomass waste supply flows and to provide platforms to match supply and demand. By supporting these types of actors, Europe can increase its capacity to transform more bio-waste into valuable commodities and contribute to sustainable and circular bioeconomy objectives and solutions based on biological resources (including ecosystems).\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n- study and optimise business models for the aggregation, pre-treatment, standardisation and primary valorisation of under-utilised biomass resources, including bio-waste from food losses and food waste and/or primary production/industrial biogenic residues. Engage with local governments to create compelling business cases and to showcase best practices that highlight the environmental, social and economic, benefits of bio-waste valorisation. In this context, the successful proposals should collaborate with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that biomass valorisation practices are socially acceptable and beneficial to communities, the environment and the economy;\n- support local, regional, and national bioeconomy actors, and develop new or strengthen existing platforms (at least 5) by connecting biomass suppliers, and users, both in urban and rural settings; provide guidance and links to local, regional, or national biomass plans; and facilitate business decisions, especially for SMEs. Additionally, map and study various types of platforms, potentially also digital marketplaces, that match biomass supply and demand within local, regional, and EU contexts;\n- identify barriers to and best available practices for the development of biomass platforms (e.g. end-of-waste criteria), and provide recommendations to address them, in national, regional and EU context;\n- develop tools and innovative approaches to optimize bio-waste collection, processing and logistics, enhancing resource efficiency and ecosystem health, as well as reducing costs. Exploit the potential of digital solutions to improve the traceability and management of bio-waste streams. Advance innovative and competitive business solutions, developing and testing technological innovations for biomass aggregation, pretreatment, and standardisation, including from under-utilised biomass resources, and processing towards added-value products.\nProposals should pay particular attention to areas where biomass is neither fully valorised nor utilised to its full potential, such as Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine and other EU candidate countries.\nProposals are encouraged to work together with relevant initiatives including those of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy, Bioeconomy Monitoring System, the EU Food Systems Monitoring Dashboard), the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, the New European Bauhaus and BIOEAST Initiative; as well as considering the topic ‘HORIZON-CL6-2026-CIRCBIO-10: Understanding biomass flows in Europe’. When addressing the collection, pre-treatment and valorisation of food losses and waste, proposals should explore potential links with the work of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste.\nThe multi-actor approach should be followed, involving concerned actors such as primary producers, industry representatives, regional/local authorities, research institutions.",

It also contributes to the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy. Synergies with activities under the Circular Bio-based Europe (CBE) Joint Undertaking [1] and New European Bauhaus are strongly encouraged, while taking care to avoid overlaps.\nProposals should address the following activities:\n- develop and deploy/scale-up safe and sustainable, circular and bio-based materials, products, processes and value chains, e.g. including but not limited to the construction, packaging, pulp and paper, textile sectors, or other bio-based consumer products, using upcycled and recycled resources incorporating secondary raw materials with minimal quality loss, aiming at best environmental performance, while increasing the uptake of recycled materials and preventing waste through repair, refurbishment, and reuse, and paying attention to environmental and health risks and trade-offs due to treated or impregnated bio-based materials, where relevant. Bioenergy/biofuels sector is not in scope, but synergies with this sector can be considered while respecting the cascading biomass valorisation principle and aiming at the industrial symbiosis;\n- develop innovative new, or upgraded existing, circular solutions to tackle complex bio-waste streams and create markets for bio-waste materials by transforming them into valuable secondary resources, while fostering urban/rural/coastal industrial symbiosis, providing data and digital tools and promoting a more efficient use of bio-based resources;\n- develop a ‘digital marketplace’, ensuring convergence with the digital technology, tools and applications, to enhance accessibility and traceability of bio-based resources, promoting efficient and sustainable resource management;\n- provide recommendations for the development of bio-based product value chains, based on the identified and analysed needs of stakeholders in terms of national and European regulations and standards, financial incentives, professional trainings, etc.\nWhile the main focus of this topic is not the gaseous carbon conversion (see parallel topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-08: Biotechnology application for CCU), this technology can be considered as part of the whole value chain approach to increase environmental and economic impact, e.g. as part of the cascading biomass conversion, taking care to avoid overlaps and seek synergies. Synergy and cooperation with the parallel topics HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-02: Enhancing ecodesign and circularity of construction products and HORIZON-MISS-2027-03-OCEAN-02: Circularity of seafood supply chain are strongly encouraged.\nProposals are encouraged to build on the knowledge and results of completed and ongoing EU-funded projects. Cooperation between all proposals funded under this topic should also be foreseen, as a specific task, with an allocation of resources, for synergies.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. This can cover the educational aspect, to facilitate knowledge promotion within different target groups (e.g. students, industry, society). International cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] Such as the topics HORIZON-JU-CBE-2025-IAFlag-03: Circular-by-design fibre-based packaging with improved properties, HORIZON-JU-CBE-2025-IAFlag-01:Urban-industrial symbiosis for bio-waste valorisation, etc.",

      "scope": "The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand in clean tech and energy-intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll-out of clean energy and manufacturing, to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 2026-2027 work programme supports fit-for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus exclusively on clean tech and energy-intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n- Implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

      "scope": "Chemical pollution of aquatic environments from contaminants and pollutants poses risks for human and environmental health. As recent assessments of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and of the Water Framework Directive have shown, large parts of Europe’s groundwater bodies, rivers, lakes, coastal, transitional and marine waters have not reached good status and often exceed regulatory threshold levels set to avoid potential risk to human health and the environment. Continued inflow of pollutants into the aquatic environment, coupled with their ubiquity and persistent nature is increasing the risk of accumulation and long-term exposure of organisms and human beings. While pollution prevention is the most effective measure to tackle aquatic pollution, more effective action and novel solutions are needed to bioremediate and decontaminate European waters from particularly harmful and persistent substances.\nAquatic microorganisms and their communities have developed various molecular mechanisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions enabling them to degrade a wide range of pollutants. The kinetics of community evolution and their molecular mechanisms must be considered. However, the complexity of contaminated marine and freshwater environments including groundwater, where multiple pollutants often coexist as mixtures, metabolites and transformation products are created with changing properties and toxicity levels and interactions with the soil or seabed properties makes risk assessment and remediation a significant challenge. Therefore, a better knowledge of CEC interaction with the surrounding environment (mechanisms, parameters of influence, soil constituents involved) is needed to develop optimised treatment. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have created new opportunities for environmental cleaning, particularly when combined with microbial remediation. As a result, aquatic pollutant-degrading microbes enhanced by nanoparticles are becoming increasingly valuable for developing biotechnological tools that can effectively clean up contaminated environments.\nProposals should:\n- develop and demonstrate novel approaches, locally adaptable and site-specific solutions for the bioremediation and decontamination of aquatic pollution at source, in rivers, lakes, coastal and groundwaters and at sea, including removal processes, management of degradation processes, ensuring the approaches do not harm the environment;\n- develop and demonstrate new, effective and affordable technologies, considering particularly solutions based on life sciences and biotechnology, including microorganisms and/or microbial communities and/or nanoparticles biosynthesized by microbial activity, for the removal of pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants, degrading pollutants (e.g. plastics, oil, hydrocarbons), marine mucilage, contaminants of emerging concern and targeted micropollutants (PFAS, pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials, pesticides and micro-and nano-plastics) from marine waters, wastewater and drinking waters and the environment including groundwater and sediments. Recovery of the biosynthesized nanoparticles will be an asset in proposals but not required;\n- integrate environmental monitoring methods (including effect-based methods), building on existing methodologies, and high-resolution methods for robust risk assessment of the impact of CECs on aquatic ecosystems, as well as assessment of the improved resilience of bioremediated aquatic ecosystems to climate change;\n- demonstrate pathways and interlinkages of the pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, and to develop understanding where management actions are most beneficial and needed;\n- ensure transparent engagement with stakeholders and society on solutions proposed.\nProposals should bring together a wide range of relevant stakeholders, i.e., researchers, technology providers, policy makers and local competent authorities to maximise impact. Case-studies representing the regional specificities in term of climate conditions are welcomed but not required.\nProposals should ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe, including the ones funded under the Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters” and under the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC). Projects should engage with and help build an emerging community on decontamination and bioremediation, in particular the one envisaged through the related public private initiative in the European Water Resilience Strategy.\nThe participation of SMEs and Start-ups in the consortia is encouraged. The JRC may contribute with its expertise related to nanotechnology/nanoparticles and environmental biotechnology particularly in metagenomics and to the effect-based methods for the chemical pollutants' detection in water.\nProjects under this topic are relevant to the European Ocean Pact, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, the Environmental Quality Standards Directive, the European Water Resilience Strategy, the EU zero pollution action plan, the Nature Restoration Regulation, the Commission communication on Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Life Sciences Strategy and the EU Biotech Act.",

      "scope": "The air we breathe is often polluted, which can lead to serious health problems and even premature death. To address this public health issue, it is essential to understand how pollutants move and interact in the air at different scales, from regional to street level and at different time periods during the day or in different seasons. However, current models used to predict air quality have limitations, particularly in terms of their grid resolution levels and their limited ability to accurately capture the complex interactions between different scales. This can lead to uncertainties and inaccuracies in assessing and predicting air quality, making it challenging to develop and take effective measures to improve air quality.\nThis topic aims to improve these capabilities by developing a chain of innovative integrated models, relatively easy to use and interpret, that can simulate the air quality situation in different scales and types of areas, including at ‘micro-scale’, and by integrating a temporal-scale dimension, also taking into account emissions into the ambient atmosphere from indoor environments. This should support the development of effective air quality planning strategies at various levels, ultimately helping to reduce air pollution and protect public health. Moreover, it should support the requirements in the revised Ambient Air Quality Directive as regards the development of Air Quality Roadmaps and Air Quality Plans, and for the design and planning of the network of monitoring stations.\nMore specifically, proposals should:\n- develop comprehensive multi-scale modelling chains possibly with two-way nesting capabilities (TRL 5), addressing air quality assessment, including spatial and temporal representativeness, and atmospheric processes of air pollution. Incorporate and improve urban canopy parameterization to better account for complex interactions between urban structures and air pollutants, including the role of urban vegetation in mitigating and/or fostering the formation and/or accumulation of specific air pollutants, with an emphasis on air pollutants with the highest health impacts;\n- analyse the current limitations associated with the integration of different models and multiple spatial/ temporal scales in a single modelling system and develop methods to improve and integrate the existing air quality models and required input datasets (TRL 5);\n- develop, configure and validate innovative micro-scale modelling systems at very high resolution with the aim of modelling and evaluating the impact of air quality measures to minimize, mitigate, and prevent exceedances at hotspot locations (TRL 5);\n- provide guidelines for air quality modelling to support decision making to improve air quality at all scales, including by harmonizing different types of models within an integrated system, as well as promoting the use and development of multi-scale online modelling systems.\nPopulation groups in vulnerable situations are disproportionally affected by air pollution. Proposals should consider the vulnerability dimension (e.g. for children, older people, women, people with lower socio-economic status, people with underlying health conditions) when approaching different scale analyses and provide recommendations on whether and how links could be made with data on social and spatial inequalities related to air pollution exposure and benefits of mitigation measures in developing inclusive air quality plans and in urban planning.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects and initiatives with a relevant air quality monitoring and/or modelling component to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid duplication. These could include projects funded under H2020 and Horizon Europe as well as under LIFE strategic integrated projects for clean air, such as LIFE PREPAIR and LIFE Malopolska.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] in the environment domain, such as ACTRIS [2] . Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nProposals should, where possible, build on results of and cooperate with AQUILA and FAIRMODE communities and pave the way for the possible transition of the project outcomes into the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. This topic is part of the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative, and projects should collaborate with related projects funded by ESA’s FuturEO programme and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as a member of the consortium selected for funding. In particular, the JRC could, as relevant, promote and support the harmonised use of scientifically sound air quality modelling approaches and help identify best practices in the area. In this regard, JRC would also usefully facilitate interaction with the JRC-chaired Forum for Air quality Modelling (FAIRMODE).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[2] Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure: https://www.actris.eu",

      "scope": "Industrial bio-based systems – made by the supply chain of bio-based feedstock and the industrial value chains - are key elements for the establishment of a fossil-free economy in the EU and Associated Countries (AC). Innovative industrial bio-based systems - also enabled by biotechnology applications - have the capacity to deliver products and services with improved environmental performances. To support the deployment of the best among such systems, it is necessary to create a framework which facilitate the benchmarking. The European Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) - based on the recently revised Industrial and Livestock Rearing Emission Directive (IED 2.0) - collects information on innovative techniques, including emerging [1] and transformative techniques, and assesses their level of development and their environmental performance, including their cost-effectiveness and their trade-offs.\nProposals should:\n- establish a forum of experts and stakeholders in the bioeconomy and in industrial bio-based systems, including representatives from academia, industry, and government. Members of the forum should be part of the project consortium and should cover, at least, the specific sectors as described in the bullet point below;\n- animate the work of the forum to: select and collect data on emerging techniques (as defined in Art. 3.14 of the IED 2.0) along the whole supply and value chain of industrial bio-based systems, on a worldwide basis, but especially those being tested or used in the EU and ACs. Assess their level of development and environmental performance, including their cost-effectiveness and trade-offs. Industrial bio-based systems in scope of this topic do not include food/feed, biofuels/bioenergy and health and medical devices; align the selection, the collection of relevant data and the assessment of such techniques with the approach of the European Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) and with the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy); give emphasis on relevant emerging techniques including, but not limited to, specific sectors: i) pulp & paper and bio-based chemicals, including the treatments and further conversion of industrial residues and waste from these sectors, ii) mechanical and chemical recycling of bio-based plastic, iii) bioremediation applications - also enabled by biotechnology - to remediate and regenerate polluted ecosystems. The scope of bioremediation applications should include landfills and mining; include data on climate change mitigation/adaptation and on the capacity for biodiversity protection and enhancement of the selected techniques, where relevant; align the collection of life cycle assessment (LCA) information, according to the Environmental Footprint recommendation, and the methodological guidance of the voluntary Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) Framework [2] , where applicable;\n- integrate the collected information and data into the Sevilla process through INCITE and into the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, for example in the collection of data on emerging techniques.\nSynergies with projects funded under the topics on bioeconomy in the current and past Cluster 6 work programmes, and with projects assessing the best practices in the biofuels/bioenergy sectors under Cluster 5 work programmes are encouraged.\n[1] ‘Emerging technique’ means a novel technique for an industrial activity that, if commercially developed, could provide either a higher general level of protection of human health and the environment or at least the same level of protection of human health and the environment and higher cost savings than existing best available techniques, Art 3 IED 2.0.\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022H2510",

With a view of contributing with breakthrough innovation to this strategy, proposals are expected to address creative or disruptive solutions to develop a set of means for its implementation. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed activities, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of appropriate stakeholders, including where relevant farmers, water intensive industries, energy producers, land managers, water governance bodies and local authorities. Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at local, national and EU level for possible next steps after the project. In this topic the integration of the gender and intersectional dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Proposals should consider and possibly expand on previous research of related past national or EU-funded projects, avoiding duplication.\nProposals should address one or more of the following actions:\nRestore the Water Cycle\n- uptake of innovative solutions to help retain water in natural ecosystems at regional level, including groundwater, to restore free flowing and renaturalising river shapes, to promote water-efficient practices and optimised soil-water interactions, to implement the source-to-sea approach and supporting biodiversity;\n- increase preparedness against water scarcity, droughts and floods, and integrate global change adaptation strategies, including climate-resilient water infrastructure, early warning systems, and risk assessments to enhance the resilience of water systems to future climate impacts;\n- improve hydrological and ecological monitoring to better assess the impacts of various water resources management actions and interventions, while facilitating cross-border collaboration and open access to data.\nWater smart economies\n- in line with the water efficiency first principle, identify techniques or methodologies and their advantages and develop indicators for water efficiency in various water consuming sectors, e.g. agriculture;\n- develop and propose water pricing systems and certification systems that rewards sustainable land management practices and that promote the efficient provision of water services and the efficient use of water;\n- propose a set of innovative technological and digital solutions for the water (services) sector and water user sectors, to promote a water-smart economy and to implement the water efficiency first principle;\n- develop and upscale innovative water reuse and recycling solutions, including potable applications where appropriate, contributing to circular water use.\nEnsuring clean and affordable water for all\n- analyse the barriers that prevent public participation and engagement and developing actions to increase public awareness and engagement in drinking water resource protection and river basin management plans;\n- develop cost effective measures to ensure equitable access to affordable water and sanitation for groups in vulnerable situations such as women, children, elder people, low-income communities, indigenous peoples, or persons with disabilities LGBTIQ people, people with a racial or religious minority background;\n- develop methodologies to improve the influence of water footprint over consumption processes/patterns.\nProposals covering more than one action are not required to make links between the different actions if there is not. However, they should convincingly explain how their proposed actions are expected to contribute to the achievement of the expected outcomes they address.\nProposals should leverage relevant Copernicus elements and foster complementarities, avoiding overlaps with projects funded under previous Framework Programmes, the Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All), the EU Missions 'Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030', 'Adaptation to Climate Change' and 'A Soil Deal for Europe'. Proposals should include a task to ensure collaboration with the other projects funded under this topic. It should reinforce the complementarities of approaches and methodologies developed and maximise the outcome of the topic for the different actions foreseen.\nJRC can support the awarded consortium with its expertise and work on current, emerging, and future risks associated with water-related extremes such as droughts and floods, and with its efforts to enhance the drought and flood components of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service.\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/topics/environment/water-resilience-strategy_en",

      "scope": "Farmers are exposed to numerous and increasing risks and crises of diverse nature and scale, putting pressure on their wellbeing, business viability and income. So far, available risk and crisis management tools have been insufficient in addressing the growing needs for strengthening resilience capacities. There is a need for more knowledge and solutions adapted to the diversity of farming systems and contexts. This would enable more integrated management of risks and crises, leading to more effective emergency response and adequate prevention and management on the long term. Proposals should target one or more risks and crises (e.g., sanitary, environmental, economic, geopolitical, ecological, demographic, technological) that are causing, or likely to cause, significant socio-economic impacts directly or indirectly affecting EU farmers, considering among others potential compound and amplifier effects under climate change and biodiversity loss.\nThe actions funded under this topic should support the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the Common Agricultural Policy.\nProposals should:\n- improve understanding of farmers’ individual and collective options, strategies, incentives, behaviour and decision-making regarding uncertainties, risk and crisis management. This work should capture the context in which farmers operate, including interactions with other agri-food supply chain operators, critical dependencies, as well as market conditions and policies;\n- assess the anticipation, robustness and adaptation capacities of farms, costs and benefits of action vs. non-action, and the interactions between risk management, crisis management and the adoption of preventive practices on farms, at landscape level and/or along agri-food supply chains. This work should also analyse the transformative capacities of farms in response to challenges that make business as usual not viable or not possible;\n- propose inclusive solutions, improve and develop integrated risk and crisis management strategies, at farm and landscape level and/or along the agri-food supply chain, to improve the resilience of farming systems. Proposed solutions should consider different types of production and the risk perceptions of practitioners, and they should be adapted to the practitioners’ risk preferences and resilience requirements. This work should also include an assessment of the costs and benefits of the solutions;\n- propose criteria and measures to improve fair risk sharing along the agri-food supply chain and for derisking, to mitigate economic risks for farmers;\n- test the proposed strategies and/or measures, using an experimental approach. Proposals are encouraged to build for this purpose on existing participatory infrastructures (e.g., demonstration sites, living labs, etc);\n- support inclusive and accessible capacity building, training, and education on risk and crisis management for farmers and other relevant agri-food supply chain operators (“risk literacy”);\n- consider compound and amplifier effects of climate change and biodiversity loss on other types of risks and crises in all activities whenever appropriate and relevant.\nProposals should assess and compare options and strategies developed by farmers implementing various farming approaches, one of which should be organic farming.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The JRC’s participation could involve contributing to the understanding of farmer risk preferences, measurement and design of risk sharing alternatives for the agri-food supply chain and testing alternatives using experimental methods.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. They should also ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects, including from the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Soil. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies (e.g., fi-compass studies), projects, initiatives and processes.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.). The selected projects are also expected to collaborate with relevant projects selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-CLIMATE-03: Strengthening evidence-based policies for the resilience of European agriculture and forestry and related supply chains against crises and systemic risks.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, government representatives, agri-food supply chain operators (e.g., processors), and civil society organisations.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.",

      "scope": "The agri-food sector is an important pillar to EU competitiveness. It is composed of diversified businesses representing around 15% of total EU employment and contributes to provide essential services and secure a stable and affordable supply of food to EU citizens. The concept of agricultural competitiveness is complex and approached with different perspectives and methodologies in the scientific literature. EU policies aim at addressing a growing number of objectives in a challenging and evolving context (e.g., climate change, biodiversity loss, geopolitical tensions, fast digitalisation). There is a need to update knowledge and tools on agricultural competitiveness. This should contribute to improve our capacity to design and implement agricultural policies, effective in navigating and addressing multiple objectives while enabling green and digital transitions without undermining our competitiveness over time. Successful proposals under this topic should support the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Competitiveness Compass, the Common Agricultural Policy, the sustainability objectives (including on climate and biodiversity) of the Green Deal, and the SDGs.\nProposals should:\n- address analytical gaps on competitiveness to better account for their various drivers, inputs (including land, labour, capital), components (e.g., costs, price, innovation capacity, investment capacity, market share, market position, resilience, knowledge, skills, productivity, product quality, differentiation) and impacts (economic, environmental and social). Consider various value chains and farming systems in different regions, one of which should be organic farming. This activity should integrate knowledge from different disciplines (e.g., economics, management, agronomy, environmental sciences);\n- improve the capacity to analyse agriculture-related policies supporting and recognising sustainable practices (such as supporting climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development goals) across the value chain (e.g., due diligence, deforestation-free products) and in trade agreements, in particular their capacity to support competitiveness and resilience objectives, and to mitigate leakage effects;\n- provide evidence on the social, economic and environmental drivers of competitiveness, synergies, trade-offs between the sustainability dimensions, at and between different stages of the value chain (including farm-level, producer organisations, upstream and downstream operators etc.) as well as spatial (local to global) and time scales (short to long term). Proposals are encouraged to consider different lengths of value chains (e.g., short, mid-tier, global), business strategies (e.g., economies of scale, specialisation and agglomeration vs economies of scope) and marketing strategies (e.g., quality differentiation);\n- identify, improve and/or develop adequate indicators and metrics, and collect the necessary data, to improve the measurement of performance, sustainability, resilience, productivity and competitiveness in analytical tools. This work should take into account the practical needs of decision-makers and the context of their operations (e.g., international versus local strategy). Particular attention should be paid to prioritising relevant robust indicators that could be replicated in different countries;\n- provide recommendations and propose levers to anticipate trade-offs and conciliate competitiveness, resilience and sustainability objectives in business strategies and policies and support the long-term prosperity of the agricultural sector.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools and ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies, projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., competitiveness check).\nThe JRC’s participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the iMAP modelling platform, sharing of information and contribution to dissemination of results.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, businesses and other relevant actors from agri-food supply chains.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Mediterranean countries.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.",

      "scope": "There is a growing need to disseminate practical knowledge on challenges and opportunities for agriculture, forestry and rural areas stemming from both scientific-research and practical experience, and to effectively link it to the relevant actors through enhanced thematic collaboration between researchers, advisors and farmers.\nEU thematic knowledge hubs should transform both existing and new knowledge into accessible formats for advisors and targeted end-users, focusing on dissemination over collection. By blending the strengths of thematic and advisory networks, these hubs should offer services to widely disseminate information on specific themes among practitioners on the ground, contributing to a well-informed, and engaged AKIS community. Proposal should set up these hubs as a go-to source for valuable content, facilitating access to relevant thematic research findings presented in a practical way, innovative solutions, and best practices, empowering advisors with cutting-edge knowledge and providing ample opportunities of collaboration and cross fertilization amongst the different AKIS actors.\nProposals should:\n- compile a comprehensive up-to-date scientific and practical knowledge, best practices and innovative solutions within the thematic area indicated, which are effective and ready for use in practice, but not commonly known and/or used by the end-users. This objective should be achieved by primarily drawing from existing resources, while also remaining open to incorporating new sources as they become available;\n- develop and widely share and disseminate an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing informative materials and training courses using the most effective approaches, formats, tools (including audio-visual) to reach end-users and advisors through diverse channels mostly used by practitioners. The information provided should be easy to access and understand and translated into at least all 24 EU official languages to allow dissemination across the whole EU. Consortia should ensure collection and dissemination of knowledge from and to at least fourteen EU Member States, guaranteeing a balanced geographical coverage across the EU;\n- offer services that enhance networking, cross-fertilization and knowledge exchange between the different AKIS actors [2] , to stimulate dialogue on innovative solutions and initiatives, to build relations and support mutual learning across the EU;\n- actively involve advisors in EU thematic knowledge hubs and mobilise also other relevant AKIS actors (including the AKIS coordination bodies) and actions at European/national/regional levels to support the implementation of the knowledge and solutions in practice across the EU;\n- include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with, ensure complementarities, avoid duplication of efforts and use efficiently the outputs and activities of the relevant past, existing and future AKIS projects [3] ;\n- establish strong collaborations with national or regional authorities and ecosystems ensuring effective partnerships that support Member States in the training of advisors and enable them to provide practical guidance tailored to diverse contexts, including accessing finance;\n- develop a long-term plan to update and maintain the knowledge hub and its outputs beyond the project duration. Ensure that all resources are created with interoperability, adaptability and transferability in mind to facilitate their continued use and transfer/integration across diverse platforms and stakeholders.\nProposals should either address the thematic Area A: Holistic management of crop nutrition and protection for resilient and healthy cropping systems or Area B: Agrobiodiversity and wild pollinators for economic and environmental sustainability. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the proposal. Within the frame of each of the broad thematic area, applicants should select specific topics in a bottom-up way in order to respond to the most urgent need(s) from practice, explain the relevance of the theme in relation to end-users’ need(s), clarifying the added-value of the proposal and how it avoids duplication with ongoing or completed thematic networks and projects [4] .\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a balanced consortium of relevant actors with complementary knowledge, actively involving advisors and end-users to identify the most urgent practical needs and plan and execute the main tasks of the thematic knowledge hub. Minimum 30% of the number of people involved in the project should be impartial advisors [5] and spending at least half of their working time on giving advice to farmers. Consortium partners should have a wide network and be capable to involve as many professionally active advisors as possible across the EU into the activities of the project. To this end, proposals may involve financial support to third parties (FSTP) to ensure the involvement of advisors from across the whole EU in the activities of the advisory network.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the cross-cutting objective of the common agricultural policy (CAP) to enhance knowledge flows among AKIS actors, in particular advisory services and end-users.\n[1] An “(end-)user” of R&I result(s) is a person who is him/herself putting the results into practice (i.e. practitioner); depending on the thematic area which the knowledge hub is expected to focus on, end-users could be farmers and/or foresters and/or other rural actors, or all of them\n[2] akisconnect | Connecting all EU AKIS actors\n[3] In particular but not exhaustive the projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and CAP: advisory and thematic networks, ATTRACTISS, modernAKIS, i2connect, PREMIERE, EU-FarmBook, the future project to be selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-14, and relevant EIP-AGRI Operational Groups projects.\n[4] A theme already covered by a finished thematic network(s) is not allowed, unless the added value of the thematic network proposal is clearly explained and justified.\n[5] In line with the Article 15(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , advisors must be suitably qualified, appropriately trained and have no conflict of interest.",

      "scope": "Generational renewal is a prerequisite for European farming systems to remain resilient and competitive in the medium and long term. The actions funded under this topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the objective to shape an attractive farming and agri-food sector for future generations. To accomplish this, it is important to provide active support and specialised trainings for newcomers and young farmers. Advisors are best placed to accompany, monitor and mentor new farmers in the different stages of setting up and managing new farms. In addition, they can support new farmers in building social networks from a professional point of view and provide guidance on the different needs of takeovers and new farms. They can also contribute to advance gender equality and inclusion in this sector.\nA novelty in the current CAP strategic plans is that advisors should be integrated within the AKIS as well as be impartial, competent and up to date on scientific and innovation developments [1] . They should be able to translate the knowledge and provide concrete, targeted and practical solutions for farmers adapted to specific local circumstances.\nProposals should:\n- foster in-depth exchange of knowledge and experiences among advisors across the EU on the needs of young farmers and new entrants to successfully enter and run an agricultural business in the long-term;\n- develop and widely share diverse useful resources, tools and approaches, including learning materials and courses, new business strategies/plans, cross-border visits, internships and other initiatives that should empower advisors to effectively support young and/or new farmers in addressing the identified needs for taking over / entering and staying in the farming sector;\n- equip advisors to deliver guidance and support throughout the various stages of farm establishment. This should include offering guidance on various preparatory steps such as securing land, exploring financing options, and crafting business strategies. Advisors should also help farmers navigate practical elements like technology use, financial management, legal matters, and sustainable farming practices addressing among others climate change and biodiversity loss. Additionally, they should address challenges that arise in the early years of farm development. Special attention should be given to promoting generational transfer, helping older farmers plan for and facilitate farm succession;\n- involve advisors in an innovative EU-wide communication and awareness-rising campaigns to reposition farming as an attractive and rewarding career choice for the young generations;\n- ensure collaborations with national or regional authorities and AKIS ecosystems to promote the project outputs and ensure that they will be updated and maintained in the long-term beyond the project duration.\nThe proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders. Minimum 50% of the number of the people involved in the project should be impartial advisors spending at least half of their time on giving advice to farmers. A plan for financial sustainability and maintenance of the EU advisory network in the long-term beyond the project duration should be included in the proposal.\n[1] In line with the Article 15(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , Member States shall ensure that the advice given is impartial and that advisors are suitably qualified, appropriately trained and have no conflict of interest.",
