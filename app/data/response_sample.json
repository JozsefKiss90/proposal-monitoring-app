The Design Platform is at the heart of the Chips for Europe Initiative, it is envisaged as a key instrument to foster the development of a strong design ecosystem in the Union, by creating a pipeline of highly innovative European fabless companies, focusing particularly on the growth of start-ups and SMEs. </p><p>This activity aims at building a pioneering cloud-enabled European Design Platform that will aid users, particularly start-ups and SMEs, in accessing a wide range of advanced tools, assets and services to develop their chips. The platform, by amalgamating these resources, shall support users along the innovation process, in preparation for industrial deployment. It will facilitate increased opportunities for innovation across the industry by lowering the barrier of entry for chip design in Europe, enabling both small and large entities to drive technological progress, thereby strengthening EU’s position in the global semiconductor market. To this end, the Design Platform shall encompass a combination of a cloud-based infrastructure together with a number of dedicated design and other relevant services and activities, that are elaborated on further below. </p>\n\"}"

National Coordination Centres can also support priority areas such as the implementation of EU legislation (Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the proposed Cyber Resilience Act38, Cybersecurity Act39). The objective is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The National Coordination Centre should carry out the following tasks:</p><p>• Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the EECCC in achieving its objectives and missions;</p><p>• Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors;</p><p>• Promoting, encouraging and facilitating the participation of civil society, industry in particular start-ups and SMEs, academic and research communities and other actors at Member State level in cross-border projects and cybersecurity actions funded through all relevant Union programmes;</p><p>• Providing technical assistance to stakeholders by supporting the stakeholders in their application phase for projects managed by the ECCC, and in full compliance with the rules of sound financial management, especially on conflict of interests. This should be done in close coordination with relevant NCPs set up by Member States;</p><p>• Seeking to establish synergies with relevant activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of, and in particular in those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies;</p><p>• Where relevant, implementing specific actions for which grants have been awarded by the ECCC, including through provision of financial support to third parties in line with Article 204 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 under the conditions specified in the grant agreements concerned; such support should in particular aim at strengthening the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions (notably by SMEs); 38 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15–69). 39 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022PC0454 49</p><p>• Promoting and disseminating the relevant outcomes of the work of the Network and the ECCC at national, regional or local level;</p><p>• Assessing requests for becoming part of the Cybersecurity Competence Community by entities established in the same Member State as the NCC;</p><p>•Advocating and promoting involvement by relevant entities in the activities arising from the ECCC, the Network of National Coordination Centres, and the Cybersecurity Competence Community, and monitoring, as appropriate, the level of engagement with actions awarded for cybersecurity research, developments and deployments.</p><p>The aim is also to provide essential support in the domain of cybersecurity in the form of financial support to third parties. The funding should foremost facilitate the adoption and widespread use of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions. This should equip organisations with the latest and most effective tools and strategies available for cybersecurity, fortifying their overall cybersecurity capabilities, and helping them to become more resilient and better prepared to face the evolving challenges posed by cyber threats in the digital age. Such support should be in synergy with other actions undertaken by NCCs, such as their role as contact point, promotion of participation in cross-border projects and actions, establishing synergies with other activities, and fostering links with the ECCC and other relevant national and European actions such as the Digital Innovation Hubs. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. Indicatively 50% of the grant will be distributed via financial support to third parties. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role, they play with regards activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of, and in particular in those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>"

Gains from major breakthroughs in key capacity digital technological areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, data analytics, virtual worlds, photonics, quantum, cloud and edge computing, and others) cannot materialise if there are not enough people with adequate knowledge to develop, deploy and use those digital technologies and their related applications. Evidence from the Structured Dialogue on digital education and skills with Member States shows that a majority of Member States expressed concerns about the shortage of ICT specialists<sup>1</sup>. Even in Member States that are digital frontrunners, there is a persistent shortage of people able to develop and deploy key digital technologies<sup>2</sup>. There also is a significant increase in the demand for professionals combining sectoral knowledge with digital skills enabling the use of digital solutions for specific business cases. This is for example the case of employees in the manufacturing sector able to use augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) tools to repair engines remotely, software developers and engineers with specific automotive expertise, or professionals in industrial sectors that are key to the green transition who are increasingly relying on advanced digital technologies in the development of renewable energy or clean and smart mobility solutions. These profiles can be referred to as users of advanced digital technologies and they are crucial to enable and support the digitalisation of traditional industrial sectors from agriculture and finance to manufacturing, automotive and medicine, and are key to achieve the twin green and digital transition.</p><p>Looking at the related education offer, the 2022 JRC report shows that the offer of specialised education programme in AI, cybersecurity, HPC and data science has slightly improved in the EU 27, in particular in AI, where the number of Master programmes has increased by 20% compared to the previous year. However, it remains lower than in the United States. For cybersecurity the United Kingdom alone continue to offer as many programmes as all EU Member States together<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The actions in the skills pillar therefore aim at tackling this challenge, while triggering a new way of delivering these programmes, building partnerships between academia, businesses and research across the EU.</p><p><sup>1 </sup><em>SWD (2023) 205 final: COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT accompanying the documents: Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the key enabling factors for successful digital education and training and Proposal for a Council Recommendation on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training {COM(2023) 205 final}</em></p><p><sup>2 </sup><em>For example, over 70% of enterprises looking for ICT specialists in the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg found it extremely difficult to recruit ICT specialists. DESI 2022, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi-2022.</em></p><p><sup><em>3 </em></sup><em>https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128844/JRC128844_01.pdf</em></p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The first calls for Master’s programmes’ in the Digital Europe Programme have supported the development of excellent consortia delivering education programmes and self-standing modules to build up advanced digital skills in key digital areas, mainly AI and cybersecurity<sup>4</sup>, as well as interdisciplinary programmes targeting the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific sectors, such as health. The call of 2023 built on the experience of the first work programme<sup>5</sup>, addressing the latest initiatives to support the development and deployment of key digital skills and capacities in digital technology areas, such as AI, data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, as well as other inter-, trans- or multi-disciplinary areas, and their applications in strategic sectors. The call of 2024 will support the development and deployment of key digital skills in selected digital areas: virtual worlds, edge computing, quantum computing, photonics, and robotics and automatization. The call will also support interdisciplinary programmes that will target the acquisition of advanced green digital skills (e.g. in the area of AI, data analytics, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, etc.) in selected strategic sectors: agriculture, transport, renewable energy, waste management, as well as the acquisition of advanced digital skills for government and public sector. In the selected digital areas and strategic sectors there is a high demand for ICT specialists (and is expected to further grow), but at the same time the offer of education programmes for these areas/sectors is limited, what will hinder their potential for economic uptake and growth. The call should also support possible cooperation in the context of ongoing international cooperation related to digital topics (e.g. digital partnerships, trade and technology councils, policy dialogues, Talent Growth Task Force), e.g. by supporting students from those countries with financial support (e.g. via scholarships, fee waivers, or others) to participate in the education programmes including promoting female students participation. The proposals should clearly identify one digital area or one strategic sector as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed. It is expected to fund at least the highest-ranking proposal from each above listed digital area or strategic sector providing that all thresholds are attain and within the limits of the budget available for this topic.</p><p>Projects financed under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and complementarities with actions on technology deployment supported by other pillars of the programme as well as links and synergies with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances, Erasmus+ Alliances for Innovation, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), the EIT Campus, the Deep Tech Talent Initiative and its possible follow-up initiatives, as well as the Large Scale Partnerships under the Pact for Skills.</p><p>The primary objective of this topic is to support the design and deliver a higher degree education programme(s) (at ISCED levels 6 (Bachelor's or equivalent level), 7 (Master's or equivalent level) or equivalent in 2023 and at ISCED levels 6, 7, 8 (doctoral or equivalent level) in 2024 - hereafter education programmes and to develop related self-standing modules, in selected key digital areas and for the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific strategic sectors. Besides the design and delivery of new educational programmes and self-standing modules, the selected projects can cover activities to attract qualified teaching staff, scholarships for students, the purchase or leasing costs for equipment, and different activities to establish partnership between academia, industry and research centers. The selected projects will also bring a clear EU added-value to the proposed education activities (such as cross-border collaborations, networks and exchange of ideas).</p><p><sup>4 </sup><em>Previous calls prioritised key digital areas were: Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Cybersecurity, Data, Extended reality, Internet of Things, Microelectronics, Photonics, Quantum, Robotics.</em></p><p><sup>5 </sup><em>List of selected projects from previous DIGITAL programme calls are and will be available on the Funding and Tenders portal (i.e. DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED and DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU).</em></p>"

                    "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>World-class cross-border SOC platforms across the Union for pooling data on cybersecurity threat between several Member States, equipped with a highly secure infrastructures and advanced data analytics tools for detecting,<strong> </strong>gathering and storing data on cybersecurity threats, analysing this data, and sharing and reporting CTI, reviews and analyses.</li><li>Sharing of Threat Intelligence between National SOCs, and information sharing agreements with competent authorities and CSIRTs.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The general objective of cross-border SOC platforms is to strengthen capacities to analyse, detect and prevent cyber threats and to support the production of high-quality intelligence on cyber threats, notably through the exchange of data from various sources, public and private, as well as through the sharing of state-of-the-art tools and jointly developing cyber detection, analysis, and prevention capabilities in a trusted environment.</p><p>This action aims at new cross-border SOC platforms, as well as supporting those that were already launched under the previous DIGITAL work programme (2021-2022). While the main focus of this action is on processes and tools for prevention, detection and analysis of emerging cyber-attacks, it also foresees in particular the acquisition and/or adoption of common (automation) tools, processes and shared data infrastructures for the management and sharing of contextualised and actionable cybersecurity operational information across the EU.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Cross-border SOC platforms will contribute to enhancing and consolidating collective situational awareness and capabilities in detection and CTI, supporting the development of better performing data analytics, detection, and response tools, through the pooling of larger amounts of data, including new data generated internally by the consortia members.</p><p>The platforms should act as a central point allowing for broader pooling of relevant data and CTI, enable the spreading of threat information on a large scale and among a large and diverse set of actors (e.g., CERTs/CSIRTs, ISACs, operators of critical infrastructures).</p><p>Also, for cross-border SOC platforms, there is a crucial need for novel tools based on advanced Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), data analytics and other relevant cybersecurity relevant technologies, based on research results and further tested and validated in real conditions, in combination with access to supercomputing facilities (e.g., to boost the correlation and detection features of cross-border platforms).</p><p>The platforms will support common situational awareness and effective crisis management and response by providing relevant information to networks and entities responsible for cybersecurity operational cooperation and crisis management at Union level, without undue delay, where they obtain information related to an ongoing large-scale, cross-border incident, or to a major threat or a major vulnerability likely to have significant cross-border impacts or significant impacts on services and activities falling within the scope of the Directive (EU) 2022/2555.</p><p>A call for expression of interest will be launched to select entities in Member States that provide the necessary facilities to host and operate Cross-Border SOC platforms for pooling data on cybersecurity threat between several Member States. Applicants to the call for expressions of interest should describe the aims and objectives of the Cross-Border SOC platform, describe its role and how such role relates to other cybersecurity actors, and its eventual cooperation with other public or private cybersecurity stakeholders. Applicants should also provide the detailed planning of the activities and tasks of the Cross-Border SOC platform, the services it will offer, the way they will operate and be operationalised, and describe the duration of the activity as well as the main milestones and deliverables. They should also specify what equipment, tools and services need to be procured and integrated to build up the Cross-Border SOC platform, its services and its infrastructure.</p><p>To support the above activities of a Cross-Border SOC platform, the following two workstreams of activities are foreseen:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong><em>[Procurement] A Joint Procurement Action</em></strong> with the Member State participating in the Cross-Border SOC platform: this will cover the procurement of the main equipment, tools and services needed to build up the Cross-Border SOC platform.</li><li><strong><em>[Building up and running the Cross-Border SOC platform]</em></strong> A grant will also be available to cover, among others, the preparatory activities for setting up the Cross-Border SOC platform, its interaction and cooperation with other stakeholders, as well as the running/operating costs involved, enabling the effective operation of the Cross-Border SOC platform, e.g., using the equipment, tools and services purchased through the joint procurement. These will also indicate milestones and deliverables to monitor progress.</li> </ul><p>Applications shall be made to both workstreams. Applications will be object of evaluations procedures. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that have succeeded the evaluation of the joint procurement action.</p><p>These actions aim at creating or strengthening cross-border SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security of national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>"

It will empower SOCs which are linked to National SOCs, and to a stronger collaboration between local SOCs, National SOCs and Cross-Border SOC platforms, leading to an increased data sharing and better detection capability for cyber threats. This should in particular foster interoperability, identifying what data can be shared, how this is shared and in what format, requirements and sharing agreements, and ways to enable better exchange. Links to the actions funded under the Cybersecurity Skills Academy (in the main Digital Europe work programme) can also be envisaged.</p><p>These actions should lead to increased engagement, including from the private sector, and to a better collaboration towards a common EU cyber threat knowledge base and technological independence.</p><p>Additionally, Cross-Border SOC Platforms will develop a comprehensive governance framework, with for example enrolment conditions and vetting procedures. The aim is to foster discussion between such platforms, sharing best practices and identifying opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>One Coordination and support action will be selected, bringing together the largest possible network of National and Cross-Border SOC platforms.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Actions should address one or more of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Activities and technical frameworks that foster the collaboration and interconnection between Cross-Border SOC platforms and National SOCs, as well as fostering the link between National SOCs and other SOCs at national level.</li><li>Actions that support the cooperation and coordination of Cross-Border SOC platforms, both between different Cross-Border SOC platforms, and with relation to national SOCs and other SOCs.</li><li>Actions to foster links between public sector and industry, and stimulate mutually beneficial exchange of information, tools and data as well as exchange of knowledge and training opportunities.</li><li>Actions to foster links between SOCs and industrial stakeholders in artificial intelligence and in other enabling technologies, fostering the adoption of such technologies, including AI techniques and tools rand facilitating getting acquainted with existing state of the art tools (such as for example those developed in Action 1.1.4 of this work programme) and knowledge exchange.</li><li>Actions to engage stakeholders from the HPC stakeholder community and practitioners of breakthrough AI technologies, to develop a blueprint for the requirements of AI models that necessitate access to large or smaller HPC facilities, and next steps to make this happen, as well as raising awareness of this in the wider SOC community.</li> </ul><p>These actions aim at creating or strengthening <em>national</em> and/or cross-border SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security <em>of</em> national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694.</p>"

Furthermore, they may enable new possibilities to protect data security and privacy.</p><p>The objective is to enable European cybersecurity actors to take advantage of these new breakthroughs, improving detection and prevention capabilities, efficiency, scalability, and facilitating data sharing and regulatory compliance.</p><p>In particular innovative technologies should allow for the processing of larger amounts of data, automating real-time pattern recognition, log analysis, vulnerability scanning, while enabling security professionals to focus on higher level interpretation of data and response decisions. They should allow organisations to deploy solutions and larger scale, and in increasingly complex environments.</p><p>A priority is to create and strengthen capacity for original Cyber Threat Information (CTI), e.g., in the form of CTI feeds or services.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Activities should fortify cybersecurity capabilities using breakthrough technologies, encompassing various aspects of cybersecurity. This involves uptake and integration for the deployment of novel tools, systems and services for threat detection, incident response, malware defence, vulnerability management, data protection and so forth. In one or more of the following topics should be addressed:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Real-time Monitoring and Incident Response: ensuring the swift identification and response to security incidents through continuous network monitoring, alert generation, and automated response mechanisms.</li><li>Malware Defence and Analysis: mitigating malware threats by analysing code behaviour, scrutinizing network traffic, and assessing file characteristics, thereby reducing opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Proactive Vulnerability Management: identifying and addressing weaknesses proactively through automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to address potential threats before they can be exploited.</li><li>Data Protection and Anomaly Detection: safeguarding sensitive data by scrutinizing access patterns and identifying abnormal behaviour to mitigate data breaches and protect critical information.</li><li>Incident investigation to help uncover cause, scope and impact of security incidents or breaches that have occurred.</li><li>Data Utilisation with Privacy: enabling organisations to harness data for analysis and insights while preserving data security and privacy through techniques such as anonymisation and de-identification.</li> </ul><p>By addressing such issues, the cybersecurity resilience of organisations should be enhanced, improving overall cybersecurity posture, encompassing various aspects such as threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management.</p><p>In well justified cases, access requests to the EuroHPC high performance computing infrastructure could be granted.</p><p>The systems, tools and services developed under this topic, where relevant, will be made available for licencing to National and/or Cross-Border SOC platforms under favourable market conditions.</p><p>This action aims at the deployment of key technologies in cybersecurity, in particular also in the context of securing national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. As this involves the handling of cyber incidents, malware and management of vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors, the deployment of such technologies must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to these technologies are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694.</p>"

                    "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>World-class National SOCs across the Union, strengthened with state-of-the-art technology, acting as clearinghouses for detecting,<strong> </strong>gathering and storing data on cybersecurity threats, analysing this data, and sharing and reporting CTI, reviews and analyses.</li><li>Threat intelligence and situational awareness capabilities and capacity building supporting strengthened collaboration between cybersecurity actors, including private and public actors.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The objective is to create or strengthen National SOCs, in particular with state-of-the-art tools for monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cyber events, in close collaboration with relevant entities such as CSIRTs. They will also, where possible, benefit from information and feeds from other SOCs in their countries and use the aggregated data and analysis to deliver early warnings to targeted critical infrastructures on a need-to-know basis.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The aim is capacity building for new or existing National SOCs, e.g., equipment, tools, data feeds, as well as costs related to data analysis, interconnection with Cross-Border SOC platforms, etc. This can include for example automation, analysis and correlation tools and data feeds covering Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) at various levels ranging from field data to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) data to higher level CTI. National SOCs should also leverage state of the art technology such as artificial intelligence and dynamic learning of the threat landscape and context. This also includes the use of shared cybersecurity information, to the extent possible based on existing taxonomies and/or ontologies, and hardware to ensure the secure exchange and storage of information. The operations should be built upon live network data. Where relevant, consideration should be given to SMEs as the ultimate recipients of cybersecurity operational information.</p><p>A key element is the translation of advanced AI/ML, data analytics and other relevant cybersecurity tools from research results to operational tools, and further testing and validating them in real conditions in combination with access to supercomputing facilities (e.g., to boost the correlation and detection features of cross-border platforms).</p><p>Another key role for National SOCs is knowledge transfer, such as training of cybersecurity analysts. For example, SOCs dealing with critical infrastructures play a key role and should benefit from the knowledge and experience acquired by or concentrated in National SOCs.</p><p>National SOCs must share information with other stakeholders in a mutually beneficial exchange of information and commit to apply to participate in a cross-border SOC platform within the next 2 years, with a view to exchanging information with other National SOCs.</p><p>To achieve this aim, a call for expression of interest will be launched to select entities in Member States that provide the necessary facilities to host and operate National SOCs. Applicants to the call for expressions of interest should describe the aims and objectives of the National SOC, describe its role and how such role relates to other cybersecurity actors, and its eventual cooperation with other public or private cybersecurity stakeholders. Applicants should also provide the detailed planning of the activities and tasks of the National SOC, the services it will offer, the way they will operate and be operationalised, and describe the duration of the activity as well as the main milestones and deliverables. They should also specify what equipment, tools and services need to be procured and integrated to build up the National SOC, its services and its infrastructure.</p><p>To support the above activities of a National SOC, the following two workstreams of activities are foreseen:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong><em>[Procurement] A Joint Procurement Action</em></strong> with the Member State where the national SOC is located: this will cover the procurement of the main equipment, tools and services needed to build up the National SOC</li><li><strong><em>[Building up and running the National SOC]</em></strong> A grant will also be available to cover, among others, the preparatory activities for setting up the National SOC, its interaction and cooperation with other stakeholders, as well as the running/operating costs involved, enabling the effective operation of the National SOC, e.g., using the equipment, tools and services purchased through the joint procurement. These will also indicate milestones and deliverables to monitor progress.</li> </ul><p>Applications shall be made to both workstreams. Applications will be object of evaluations procedures. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that have succeeded the evaluation of the joint procurement action.</p><p>These actions aim at creating or strengthening national SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security of national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>"

This involves data and operational measure regarding cybersecurity, including penetration tests and exploitable vulnerabilities. Such information could be exploited by malicious actors, and thus it must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to these technologies are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>"
