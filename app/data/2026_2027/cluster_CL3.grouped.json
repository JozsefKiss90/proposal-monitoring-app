          "scope": "Capabilities for situational awareness and surveillance of land and sea borders need improvement, in consideration of potential future challenges that may require updated capabilities. These challenges may include potential future large-scale movements of people across external borders, resulting from future attempts to instrumentalisation of irregular migration, but also from conflicts, social, economic, environmental and climate stress in the European neighbourhood; as well as increasing availability and capability of unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles with increased payload capacity and range that make it easier to transport goods and, possibly, persons, including in connection will illicit or illegal activities such as trafficking of goods and smuggling of people across external EU borders. These challenges will be particularly relevant in regions close to the European neighbourhood.\nThis may be particularly relevant for unsupervised and difficult-to-control land and sea borders of the Union and the Schengen area.\nResearch funded under this topic should develop solutions that, through better awareness, improve efficiency and reaction time of detection, search, rescue, and recovery operations near land and sea borders, in diverse geographical and meteorological conditions, taking into account the different and diverse needs. Research funded under this topic can also promote cross-border cooperation at European regional level around innovative border management solutions demonstration testbeds.\nActions funded under this topic should develop solutions that go beyond state-of-the-art in clearly demonstrable ways, including measurable improvements in detection range, accuracy, response time, automation, and system resilience.\nImproved border surveillance and situational awareness must better safeguard and promote fundamental rights and EU values, with a particular regard to human rights, using an inclusive approach that addresses diverse needs. Solutions should also provide reliable and redundant capacities, while ensuring the safety of staff, users, and persons who may be victim of illicit activities across external borders.\nThe EBCG Capability Roadmap recognises that future capabilities that help detect cross-border irregularities and cases requiring Search and Rescue activities are essential. Solutions should be modular and scalable to cater to the regional and challenges specificities.\nCompatibility and integration with the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) is essential, and compatibility and/or exploitation of other European information-sharing environments, like the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), would be an additional asset.\nProposals should demonstrate that the proposed equipment and technologies contribute to cost reduction and energy efficiency of border surveillance and situational awareness operations.\nProposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard (ECBG) and of its Agency (Frontex). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase, including alignment with the EBCG Capability Roadmap and on the engagement with the Agency during the project implementation. At the proposal preparation stage, Frontex will not provide guidance on or otherwise be involved in the preparation of project proposals. However, proposals should consider and anticipate that Frontex may observe pilots and demonstrations during project implementation to facilitate the future uptake of innovations within the border and coast guard community.\nTo ensure active involvement and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should include a mid-term deliverable consisting of an assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, conducted by the practitioners involved in the project.",

          "scope": "Facilitation of travel and border crossings at border crossing points (BCPs) across the external EU borders went, and is further going, through developments thanks to updated procedures and regulatory frameworks and to innovative European technologies. From automated border control (ABC) gates to “no-gate” solutions and “seamless travel”, and with systems like the Entry-Exit System (EES), the Electronic Travel and Information Authorisation System (ETIAS), and the development of digital travel credentials and digital identity more in general, Europe has one of the most advanced, secure and facilitated border check systems in the world.\nTravel facilitation schemes are still not as fair, inclusive and accessible as they should be. There are several technical exceptions that for example make difficult for families, other groups of people travelling together, people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility, or with relatively lower digital skills, to smoothly use travel and border crossing facilitation solutions. This is a capability gap of travel facilitation systems that has an impact on both a fair accessibility and availability for travellers, and on performance and efficiency of the systems themselves. Travel facilitation systems should ensure both security and easy passenger flow, while remaining accessible to all travellers.\nOn the other hand, both technical systems and procedures may have differences depending on the context or the BCP of application. This may be a limit for the performance and user experience of European integrated border management, especially in a perspective of a larger help to national members of the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) from the Standing Corps of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCGA).\nAccording to the EBCG Capability Roadmap, legal border crossings should be as swift and simple as possible, while at the same time allowing a smooth crossing of bona fide persons, and of the goods carried with them.\nInnovation actions funded under this topic will develop and test solutions for advanced seamless travel and border crossing and/or visa procedures, protecting and promoting fundamental rights, minimising the risk for bias and being accessible for all travellers, with no or minimised limitations depending on age, sex, gender, disability, physical or digital abilities. To minimise potential for discrimination or physical or digital divide regarding travel facilitation schemes, solutions should be inclusive and accessible.\nFurthermore, solutions should be tested for use with the same approach by all European border control staff in all conditions and BCPs.\nThe proposed solutions can include innovative technologies, innovative processes, innovative knowledge and/or a combination thereof. Solutions should include automated decision support systems suggesting to the end-users (border checks operators) which procedure, technology or database can be used without infringing rights of travellers. Solutions should also integrate and, if appropriate, further develop, biometric matching that minimises data shared (for example limiting to matching scores) to improve data protection.\nProposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. At the stage of proposal preparation, Frontex and eu-LISA will not provide any guidance on, or otherwise be involved in the preparation of, project proposals. Proposals should consider and foresee that Frontex and eu-LISA may observe pilots and demonstrations when the project will be implemented, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border, customs and coast guard community.\nTo ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.\nDepending on the particular scope of the proposal, participation of Customs Authorities is welcome.",

          "scope": "Many unaccompanied children and young persons arriving at the external EU borders and seeking asylum, lack official documents showing their identity and age. Age assessment methods are important as they contribute to the determination of, for example, where an individual will be initially housed and what services, supports, and legal processes they will receive to ensure protection and, if applicable, child protection.\nIn other cases, minors are victim of trafficking of human beings (THB) criminal activities, either across the EU external borders, or within the EU borders. In other cases again, age assessment methods are necessary for law enforcement investigations on protecting children, forensic investigation, and/or the identification of victims.\nNo age assessment method can offer a 100% reliability. Different approaches have different sensitivity and specificity, and different sample sizes and representativeness, and some approaches are based on a non-European knowledge base. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in methods of age assessment. Methods may use approaches as diverse as interviews, psychological assessments and other holistic approaches; medical approaches such as X-rays, CT scans, DNA methylation, dental observation, or other analyses; other approaches such as image analysis; and they may use or not artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis.\nEU regulations, and guidelines by the European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA)[[ EASO Age assessment practices in EU+ countries: updated findings (europa.eu) https://euaa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EASO_Age_assessment_practices_updated.pdf []], include safeguards and recommendations, such as that the least invasive methods should be used, and that medical methods should be used as a last resort. Further studies, reports or documents have also been elaborated by the European Migration Network [1] , European networks of security practitioners for innovation, as well as at national level. The action funded by this topic should also consider these, as well as previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects.\nThis Coordination and Support Action should not develop methods or technologies of age assessment. Rather, it will analyse, including with practitioners, the current and potential methods for age assessment. It should assess and compare scientific reliability, sensitivity and specificity of different methods, as well as their potential risks for fundamental rights and how to minimize them.\nWhile the research results would not imply any legislative or policy decision on age assessment methods, the research will develop evidence-based results on options for more (compared to the state-of-the-art) appropriate models of age assessment methods that protect fundamental rights, ensuring the use of an inclusive approach that addresses diverse needs. The results of research funded by this topic will contribute to capabilities for better identification of children and minors in the migratory, security, border management and other contexts, following the principles of the EU Strategy on the rights of the child [2] . They will also contribute to the exchange of practices among European authorities.\nSynergies with other Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Destinations, such as “Better protect the EU and its citizens against Crime and Terrorism” and “Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe”, as well as with Destinations of Horizon Europe Cluster 2 “Inclusive Society”.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/networks/european-migration-network-emn_en\n[2] COM(2021) 142 final.",

          "scope": "Building on the whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach, this topic should contribute to enhancing risk awareness and disaster preparedness through the development of innovative tools, methodologies, and frameworks. A key focus should be on integrating diverse societal and resilience perspectives considering people in a vulnerable situation, ensuring inclusive participation in risk communication strategies, and leveraging accessible advanced technologies and processes to improve public understanding of hazards and vulnerabilities (such as gender, disabilities and others social factors. and capabilities. Efforts should aim at designing and validating novel approaches to risk perception, communication, including digital platforms, immersive technologies, and participatory tools that foster citizen engagement and behavioural change, as well as wildlife protection. Behavioural insights should inform the projects on effective methods in population’s preparedness including the risk communication. Special attention should be given to marginalized or vulnerable groups in a vulnerable situation ensure equitable access to risk information and preparedness resources.\nTo strengthen disaster preparedness and response capabilities across Europe, there is a clear need for an innovative, interoperable solution that enables the development of new strategies for risk awareness and disaster management. Such a solution should facilitate seamless collaboration between public authorities, civil society, local communities, and the private sector. It must support the co-creation of comprehensive preparedness plans that ensure a coordinated, robust, resilient, and effective response to a wide range of disaster scenarios. Central to this approach should be the integration of a command-and-control system that allows for centralized information management, efficient coordination among all stakeholders, and rapid, data-driven decision-making in emergency situations. For example, efforts to guarantee early action from early warning should be taken into account.\nFurthermore, proposals should work towards the creation of comprehensive, multi-stakeholder preparedness plans that involve all levels of governance, civil society, the private sector, and local communities. These plans should establish mechanisms for cross-sectoral coordination, efficient resource allocation, and effective decision-making in crisis situations and the development of solutions and tools to ensure a greater culture of safety and societal resilience in the communities. Research should also explore innovative governance models that enhance interoperability and cooperation between different entities. To strengthen disaster resilience, proposals should develop and test adaptive response frameworks that enhance collaboration between public authorities, civil society, communities, and businesses. These frameworks should incorporate near real-time risk assessment tools, digital simulations, and scenario-based exercises to improve the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disasters. The integration of AI-driven decision-support systems, taking into account existing biases, digital twin technologies (including Destination Earth), and predictive analytics could further contribute to a more effective, evidence-based crisis response.\nProjects are expected to contribute to the overall enhancement of societal resilience by fostering a culture of preparedness, strengthening community-driven disaster risk reduction initiatives, proactive engagement in prevention- and mitigation of disaster’s effects, and ensuring that all actors within society have the necessary tools and knowledge to respond effectively to future crises.\nWhere relevant, projects may take into account the assets, but also particular challenges faced by the European outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s composition.\nProjects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities.\nInternational cooperation in this topic is strongly recommended. Proposals should also take into account lessons learned from past disasters and align with existing EU policies, frameworks, and international commitments in the field of disaster risk reduction and crisis management. Especially the population preparedness chapter of the Preparedness Union Strategy, such as the preparEU initiative, should be considered.

The topic should lead to the creation of comprehensive Risk and Resilience Metrics, integrating physical, economic, and social dimensions to support decision-makers in designing effective prevention and adaptation strategies. Considering building on and leveraging from existing systems, such as the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) the Destination Earth Platform or Risk Data Hub, could be beneficial.\nProjects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities.\nProjects may take into account the assets but also particular challenges faced by the European outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s composition.\nProjects should contribute to strengthening risk governance at multiple levels by fostering collaboration between scientific communities, policymakers, emergency responders, and infrastructure operators. Efforts should be made in leveraging citizens-generated content in social media and decentralised digital platforms for citizen-driven early warning and situational awareness. Alignment with EU policies, international risk reduction frameworks, and best practices in resilience planning should be ensured, maximizing the applicability and impact of the developed solutions.

          "scope": "The scope of this topic is the development of innovative tools, equipment, and technologies to enhance the capabilities of emergency responders operating in complex and hazardous disaster environments. By leveraging advancements in smart protective equipment, in robotics, autonomous systems, remote sensing, communication and human sensor technologies, the aim is to improve the efficiency, safety, and effectiveness of emergency medical response and search and rescue operations, particularly in high-risk scenarios, such as wildfires, earthquakes and large-scale trauma events.\nProposals should explore the design, testing, and validation of innovative solutions capable of performing critical tasks in disaster-stricken areas. These technologies should be tailored to operate in extreme conditions, including high temperatures, unstable terrains, and low-visibility environments and beneficial to all individuals regardless of their age, gender or ability. Research should address challenges related to autonomous navigation, AI-driven decision-making, real-time situational awareness, and seamless integration with existing command-and-control systems used by disaster management. Collaboration of different practitioners should be supported to support proper market uptake.\nEfforts should be made to enhance interoperability and data-sharing capabilities between various platforms, emergency response teams, and crisis management systems. A key aspect of this research should be the practical deployment and validation of these technologies through field exercises and simulations in real-world disaster scenarios. User-driven design approaches, prioritising inclusivity and accessibilities should ensure that developed solutions align with the operational needs of responders in disasters., Proposals should develop a command-and-control solution that allows organisation of all activities, ensuring a swift, coordinated, and effective response to any disaster with clear plan for uptake after the project.\nProjects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and innovation community, and the relevant authorities. The current response capacities of the European Civil Protection Pool [1] its capacity gaps [2] , and the rescEU strategic reserve [3] as well as the EU Stockpiling Strategy should be taken into account in the roadmap to ensure needs-based approach. Thus, the proposals could consider innovation for heavier assets, such as flood containment and high-capacity pumping, transport or response aircraft, shelters and power generators, ground firefighting vehicles and aerial firefighting helicopters.\nFurthermore, proposals should consider ethical, legal, and social implications associated with the deployment of autonomous technologies in emergency response. Issues such as data privacy, cybersecurity, human- and animal life protection, public acceptance, and compliance with regulatory frameworks should be addressed to facilitate the responsible and effective use of these innovations.\nProjects should contribute to strengthening Europe’s disaster response capacity by equipping practitioners with state-of-the-art technological solutions that enhance their ability to operate safely and efficiently in life-threatening environments. Alignment with EU policies and international best practices should be ensured to maximize the scalability and real-world applicability of the developed solutions. The Preparedness Union Strategy is a key document in this regard. Finding synergies with projects from operational grants, such as the Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP) [4] , is recommended.\n[1] https://civil-protection-knowledge-network.europa.eu/media/ecpp-capacities-brochure\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0286\n[3] https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\n[4] Knowledge for Action in Prevention and Preparedness (KAPP) - European Commission - https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/funding-evaluations/financing-civil-protection/cp-calls-proposals/knowledge-action-prevention-and-preparedness-kapp-0_en",

          "scope": "This topic aims to foster the widespread adoption and integration of high-TRL (Technology Readiness Level) disaster risk solutions (DRS) across multiple sectors, enhancing societal resilience to various hazards, including climate. The focus is on overcoming barriers to deployment, ensuring accessibility, and strengthening collaboration among stakeholders to drive innovation uptake. Projects should promote the adoption of high-TRL solutions by public and private sector organizations involved in disaster risk management, developing strategies for scaling and commercializing innovative DRS technologies to ensure they reach end-users efficiently. They should also demonstrate how these technologies can complement or replace existing disaster preparedness, response, and recovery frameworks by developing integrated governance and coordination models across sectors and levels for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in multi-hazard and cascading risk scenario interoperability standards, and guidelines for integrating new solutions into national and European civil protection systems. The project should especially liaise and support other disaster resilience projects in driving their uptake as well as examine how to build synergy pathways with other preparedness grants, such as Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP) funding call of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).\nAddressing deployment barriers is crucial, including identifying and mitigating technical, regulatory, financial, and social obstacles hindering the uptake of advanced solutions, while ensuring accessibility and usability for diverse stakeholders such as first responders, local authorities, and communities and individuals in a vulnerable situation. Projects should also demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of high-TRL solutions through large-scale pilot projects and demonstrations, generating robust evidence to support data-driven decision-making and optimize disaster risk reduction strategies. Initiatives should consider the capacity gaps of the UCPM [1] , align with EU disaster resilience objectives and build on existing programs, ensuring synergies with relevant policies, funding mechanisms, and technological ecosystems. The private-public cooperation chapter of the Preparedness Union Strategy should especially be a guiding document. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate digital tools, AI-driven analytics, digital twins such as Destination Earth, IoT applications, and other emerging technologies to enhance disaster preparedness and response.\nProposals should have a strategy to promote the visibility of the project and the results to the broader public in order to show the potential of European civil security research (political sphere, private sector, citizens). This could entail the European Civil Protection Forum and the European Commission Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre platform as examples.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\n[1] eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0286",

          "scope": "Climate change is a global challenge with profound security implications at the global, regional, and local levels. It exacerbates risks across multiple sectors, including agriculture, biodiversity, health, border security, economy, financial stability, transport, telecommunication and human displacement, leading to severe socio-economic consequences and destabilizing communities. The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters highlight the urgent need for a holistic, long-term strategy to address climate security, integrating risk assessment, crisis management, and adaptation measures, while also leveraging the expertise of the insurance sector.\nWhile climate services based on data analysis have reached a high level of trust among users, their application to civil security remains underdeveloped. Proposals should aim to develop methodologies, tools, and technologies that enhance situational awareness both before a crisis (pre-crisis) and after a crisis (post-crisis), enabling decision-makers and populations to respond effectively. Research should focus on defining priority climate security scenarios in the EU, identifying key stakeholders, and establishing essential indicators for informed decision-making.\nEfforts should be directed toward understanding and mitigating the impacts of floods, landslides, wildfires, and other climate-induced disasters. This includes developing improved methods and models for risk prevention and reduction, early detection, emergency response tactics, and rescue efforts under extreme conditions. The study of cascading effects and compounding disasters is critical, particularly regarding groups in a vulnerable situation such as older people, people with disabilities, and children. In this view, the proposals should build on the European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA [1] ) and consolidated national risk assessments [2] as well as find synergies with project’s chosen for the similar EU Mission: Adaptation to Climate Change topic [3] . Both the European Preparedness Union Strategy, the European Water Resilience Strategy and the upcoming European Climate Adaptation Plan act as policy guidance.\nDiverse climate and environmental security scenarios should be developed, supported by innovative, reliable tools that leverage multiple data sources, enabling a comprehensive and adaptive response. Proposals should also integrate space programme components such as Copernicus and Galileo to improve data accuracy and crisis response capabilities. A strong emphasis on international cooperation should foster knowledge exchange, enhance policy integration, and share best practices. Proposals should support transnational collaboration within the EU, facilitate improved data-sharing mechanisms, and align with global initiatives such as the Sendai Disaster Risk Reduction Framework. Capacity-building efforts to strengthen resilience to climate-related security threats and ensure a coordinated approach to addressing worst-case climate scenarios, as identified in the Niinistö report [4] .\nProjects may take into account the assets but also particular challenges faced by the European outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s composition.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, Copernicus, Destination Earth, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nWhere relevant, funded projects are encouraged to liaise with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, for complementary real-scale testing at the Reaction Wall and HopLab of the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA).\n[1] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment\n[2] COM/2024/130 final, Preventing and managing disaster risk in Europe, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52024DC0130\n[3] HORIZON-MISS-2026-01-CLIMA-04: Bridging the gap between disaster risk management and climate adaptation\n[4] https://commission.europa.eu/topics/defence/safer-together-path-towards-fully-prepared-union_en",

          "scope": "Global climate change is a megatrend expected to affect our societies over the next decade. As stated in “Germany: National interdisciplinary climate risk assessment” [1] , “We are already living in the climate crisis. This brings substantial security risks at global and national levels. (...) Anyone thinking about security needs to think about climate as well”.\nClimate change will affect European law enforcement in various ways [2] , [3] . Notably, it is likely to create new opportunities and resources for organised crime, challenging current security frameworks. One of the expected outcomes of climate change will be the emergence of scarcity markets. Links between resource scarcity propelled by climate change and the crime opportunities for organised crime groups need to be further analysed. Criminal networks will aim to dominate the scarcity markets, increasing their role in the distribution of essential goods and services such as food and water. In addition, criminal networks will facilitate the movement of migrants, including women and children, escaping conflict and the effects of climate change; increased flux of migration due to extreme weather conditions may raise opportunities for human trafficking and exploitation. Furthermore, the decline in biodiversity will translate into more animal species under threat of extinction targeted by wildlife traffickers. In this landscape, the adoption of new technologies will bolster criminal organizations of various kinds. Examples of such crimes, illegal activities, threats and harms connected to climate change include: environmental crimes contributing to climate change (illegal mining and extraction, illegal use of underwater sources and streams, illegal deforestation, illegal waste management), wildlife trafficking and poaching, fraud and financial crimes (greenwashing, carbon credit fraud, misuse of climate funds), exploiting climate change-related disasters (water theft, looting after disasters, land grabbing), or social tensions (new forms of radicalisation and terrorism, increased displacement and migration challenging public order and disproportionately affecting groups in a vulnerable situation).\nNew approaches centred around crime and climate change, including crime activities’ association with and amplification by climate change, present unique challenges that require thorough investigation and analysis. Recognizing these emerging trends is vital for formulating effective plans and policies, and equipping law enforcement with specialized skills, technology (including forensics) and training necessary to tackle these challenges in an increasingly volatile world.\nIn this topic, apart from the mandatory participation of Police Authorities in the consortia, active involvement of other security practitioners, such as civil security services, Border Guard or Customs Authorities, is encouraged if relevant. Technological and societal angles should be addressed in a balanced way.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. For Police Authorities’ training-related aspects, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Research in this area could be strengthened by considering the gender-specific dimensions of vulnerabilities and needs when relevant.\n[1] https://metis.unibw.de/assets/pdf/National_Interdisciplinary_Climate_Risk_Assessment.pdf\n[2] A.Matczak, S.I.

Those improved skills, tools and training curricula are to take into account European multicultural dimension, as well as legal and ethical rules of operation;\n- Enhanced investigation tools and methodologies for Police Authorities in Europe to tackle cold cases in the context of missing persons, based on modern (forensic) technologies and criminology;\n- Modern training curricula for Police Authorities, their improved cross-border cooperation and enhanced tools and methodologies to tackle new cases of missing persons;\n- Enriched European common approaches applied by Police Authorities in Europe to fight the issue of missing persons relying on the synergy of technology, the latest socio-psychological knowledge learned from cases, as well as field experience of Police Authorities and entities dealing with victims, while fully respecting fundamental rights such as privacy, protection of personal data and anonymity of victims.",
          "scope": "The issue of missing persons is a multifaceted challenge that encompasses diverse categories and is influenced by various factors. People may go missing under a variety of circumstances, such as voluntary disappearances, abductions, cases related to mental health crises, or because of conflict, migration, geopolitical instability, natural disasters. Groups in a vulnerable situation - notably children, victims of trafficking and exploitation, persons with disabilities and persons suffering from cognitive impairments - face an even greater risk of going missing, often under distressing and dangerous conditions. Tackling this issue requires a coordinated response from multiple stakeholders, from Police Authorities via Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) or Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to the involvement of the overall society.\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement and societal developments, there is a pressing need to improve current European approaches to fight the issue of missing persons (prevention and/or investigation of cold and new cases) using innovative societal and technological solutions. To this end, modernised skills, training curricula and methodologies for Police Authorities, CSOs and NGOs to work with people in a vulnerable situation and children are needed, such as effective awareness raising campaigns, which should be accessible to persons with disabilities, that take into account European multicultural dimension. When it comes to investigation, Police Authorities need efficient tools that benefit from new and emerging technologies to solve cold cases while combining modern forensic science (including biometrics and digital forensics) and criminology, e.g., modern tools for using an old DNA, or accurate facial ageing, among others. When multiple practitioners are involved in exchanging sensitive data, data sharing tools in a privacy-preserving manner should be considered. Furthermore, for new cases of missing persons, apart from an improved cross-border cooperation, Police Authorities also need, on the one hand, a modernised training to face such situations more efficiently, improving the dialogues and interactions with families, taking into account a gender sensitive and intersectional approach when relevant, and on the other hand, modern technologies and forensic tools for, for example, fast and reliable cross-matching of DNA samples between new and cold cases.\nIf a proposal concerns forensics, its consortium should involve forensic institutes as well. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.

Based on a thorough analysis of the phenomenon under consideration in the European context, proposals should look into methodologies of catching and tackling early signs of terrorist threats, isolation and radicalisation, taking into account the social and cultural factors that may influence an individual's vulnerability to radicalisation, such as gender roles and stereotypes. Proposals should also consider how these factors may impact the effectiveness of prevention programmes and of addressing them by, e.g., creating appropriate programmes, including by modernising approaches for prevention of terrorist and lone actor attacks. Means for raising awareness (possibly training) of the relevant staff (school staff, employees in public administration, etc., in function of the building under consideration) regarding existing risks and for keeping them up to date on security matters should be tackled and designed to be inclusive and effective for diverse groups. Ways of improving cooperation between the relevant staff and Police Authorities in this context should be analysed too.

          "scope": "The rising threat of bioterrorism is driven by recent scientific advancements, notably by growing accessibility of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, related commercial services and public databases, which in turn enhance their obtainability to non-state actors and individuals with malicious intentions. The proliferation of do-it-yourself biohacking and community laboratories, including gene editing and sequencing technology, dropping costs of equipment and increased simplicity of use may inadvertently facilitate knowledge and skills dissemination about biological threats and open new pathways for bioterrorism. Challenges in detection, particularly the lengthy incubation periods of biological agents, underscore the urgent need for improved identification technologies to allow for timely intervention and reduce potential mass casualties, considering both characterization through advanced tools by expert labs and simple deployable methods. Given that properly weaponized biological agents can be more lethal than nuclear weapons, their cross-border implications warrant focused attention. Recent incidents involving biotoxins across various European countries illustrate the feasibility of biological attacks. The increasing weaponisation of drones highlights an alarming trend that could extend to biological agents, further complicating threat landscapes. The potential economic and social consequences of biological attacks necessitate robust prevention and preparedness measures to mitigate overwhelming impacts on healthcare systems and society at large.\nProposals are expected to address, in a lawful manner, the emerging threats of bioterrorism in Europe, particularly in the context of synthetic biology. Recognising bioterrorism as a low-probability but high-impact event, consortia should review current and future risks, flag areas requiring reinforced monitoring, as well as identify missing regulatory frameworks necessary for ensuring public security and safety. Furthermore, proposals should bring together diverse consortia to enhance our understanding, prevention, preparedness, and response to bioterrorism and create a comprehensive approach to this pressing issue.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\nProposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they would engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project.

However, rapid deployment of new and emerging technologies, such as, but not limited to: green and grid-interactive roofs and walls, solar power installations, electric vehicle charging stations, energy storages, smart sensors and surveillance systems, green transportation systems, nature-based or other sustainable or reused construction materials, or specific infrastructure solutions may create security risks through new interdependencies including legacy infrastructure, the accumulation of deployed solutions, or otherwise create new potential risks and hazards of unknown scale and origin.\nProposals submitted under this topic should investigate the integration of sustainable & environmentally friendly technologies into urban and peri-urban areas to identify and explore physical and cyber risks and vulnerabilities resulting from this phenomenon, including, but not limited to: battery fires, toxic leaks, electric shocks, structural integrity, toxic waste, data privacy, land management disruptions, including potential negative impacts on the natural environment, or social and community tensions. The proposals should also consider the threat of malicious access, software and data manipulation and misuse of managing systems potentially leading to harm to health, loss of life, environmental damage or economic damage, regardless of whether the intention is criminal, vandalism, hybrid attack or other.\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to inform operators, first responders and authorities on how to mitigate risks, enhance their preparedness and improve their response to potential incidents. By recognizing emerging threats, it should be possible to prevent major incidents from occurring, and in the event of an accident, provide effective strategies, managerial advice, processes and methodologies to respond and recover. The research should provide recommendations that are tailored to diverse communities and context needs such as those with different socio-economic profiles, adapted to people of different ages and genders to identify and mitigate physical and cyber risks and vulnerabilities. Proactively addressing major safety and security risks associated with the green transition will help to future-proof these technologies, build public trust, and promote their widespread acceptance, backed by evidence-based safety and security policies.\nThe proposed research should provide a comprehensive understanding of adaptive capabilities, the risks and vulnerabilities associated with green technologies , as well as practical recommendations for mitigating these risks and ensuring their safe, resilient and secure deployment while utilising the nature-based solutions and respecting principles of biodiversity. By doing so, it will contribute to the development of a resilient and sustainable urban environment, where the benefits of green technologies can be fully realized while minimizing their potential risks and negative impacts.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

The vulnerability of key infrastructures is exacerbated by their growing interdependencies and the systemic propagation of risks across sectors and borders. In this context, ensuring the monitoring, protection and continuity of essential services has become fundamental to preserving and enhancing societal resilience.\nThis topic aims to support the development and demonstration of targeted high-tech capabilities that address specific preparedness, operational, and recovery gaps in the resilience of critical entities [1] under multi-hazard and NaTech conditions. It calls for moving beyond generic resilience frameworks toward sector-specific, interoperable, and modular technological and governance solutions that can be deployed and tested in realistic operational settings.\nProposals should be grounded in existing risk assessments and draw on lessons learned from recent disruptive events. They are expected to deliver measurable improvements in both technological and organisational resilience through the identification and prioritisation of critical capability gaps, especially where cascading and cross-sectoral risks are likely to arise. In parallel, adaptive continuity planning and decision-making tools should be designed to enhance situational awareness, support dynamic response coordination, and maintain service continuity in fast-evolving crisis scenarios.\nProposals should also demonstrate cross-border, multi-actor coordination mechanisms through simulations or testing in real operational environments, involving public authorities, emergency responders, and critical service operators or representative environments where critical infrastructure is particularly exposed to multi-hazard risks.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, particularly in regions with cross-border infrastructure or shared vulnerabilities. Actions should take due account of the relevant EU legal and policy frameworks and are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introductions of the Resilient Infrastructure and Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe Destinations.\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic and projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-01: Open topic for improved preparedness for, response to and recovery from large-scale disruptions of critical infrastructures and HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European critical entities , and HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-04: Hi-tech capacities for crisis response and recovery after a natural-technological (NaTech) disaster should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication, share resources and exploit complementarities and opportunities for increased impact.\n[1] Including, but not limited to, infrastructures addressed by the revised EU Maritime Security Strategy (JOIN/2023/8) and the European Port Strategy.",

A key focus is bridging the gap between early-stage, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) research and applied security solutions, ensuring that emerging technologies are effectively transitioned into operational use.\nProposals should prioritize disruptive solutions that address diverse security threats while improving the efficiency and effectiveness of civil security operations. Emphasis should be placed on ensuring that these technologies are robust, reliable, scalable, and aligned with the needs of security practitioners. This includes fostering a structured pathway for transitioning low TRL innovations into practical applications, ensuring rigorous testing and validation processes for safety, performance, and interoperability.\nTo achieve this, proposals should promote strong collaboration between researchers, public authorities, industry partners, and end-users. Such partnerships will help align technological advancements with real-world security needs, facilitating the co-development of solutions that are both innovative and operationally relevant. Ensuring that emerging technologies are ethically sound, transparent, and accessible will also be crucial to their successful adoption.\nThe expected outcomes of this topic include improved preparedness through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies tailored to emerging security challenges, enhanced risk mitigation capabilities, and the accelerated integration of disruptive innovations into civil security frameworks. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, projects should ensure that promising research transitions effectively into practical security applications, contributing to a more resilient and adaptive civil security landscape across Europe.\nTo ensure that the proposed research and innovation activities are aligned to EU long-term strategic priorities, proposers are encouraged to consult relevant technology foresight exercises [2] .\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] In the context of this Destination, the concept of ‘disruptive technological innovations’ refers to breakthrough technologies starting at low or very low TRL (<4) and holding the promise of inducing a paradigm shift in the way civil security operations are currently carried out, e.g. by significantly improving performance and/or reducing costs if further developed.\n[2] See, for instance, Conte, N., Maleville, A. d., Favino, R., Garcia Monreal, E., Montanari, E. et al., Emerging risks and opportunities for EU internal security stemming from new technologies , Publications Office of the European Union, 2025, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2760/9617320",

          "scope": "As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&D) services and innovative civil security technology solutions.\nProposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals are expected to include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise proposals that should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project.\nThe proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous Horizon Europe work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies . The proposals should provide clear evidence to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It should be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project. The tender process to be followed is described in Annex H.\nProposals should demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects should be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is recommendable to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:\n- Procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.\n- Launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.\n- Adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).\n- Foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).\nIn these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP [1] . In the first case, the procurers should foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers should foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users that are not part of the consortium (e.g. citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly hardware components, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.\nApplicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:\n- A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.\n- Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2026-2027, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call expects proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.\n- Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;\n- Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.\n- Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.\nApplicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] See General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.",

          "scope": "This Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI) initiative aims to advance the adoption of innovative civil security solutions. The focus is on solutions that have been partially demonstrated on a small scale and are nearly or already available in small quantities but have not yet been widely adopted or produced at scale. These solutions should demonstrate a clear market potential and be new to the procurers, their market segment, or the internal EU market, and must be relevant to procurers across EU Member States and/or Associated Countries.\nThis PPI will specifically target innovative solutions that can address critical challenges in civil security and that are aligned with market readiness criteria. The solutions should meet requirements for sustainability (both operational and environmental), interoperability, adaptability, and be commercially viable while still holding residual market risks, such as not yet being produced in large quantities or at market-ready quality and pricing.\nThis initiative will focus on solutions that have already demonstrated partially successful results but require scaling, refinement, or deployment in new environments to meet mass-market price/quality standards. This is in line with Horizon Europe’s objective of fostering the early adoption of innovations that are critical to improving civil security across Europe [1] .\nIn compliance with the requirements of the Horizon Europe Work Programme – General Annex H, this action will engage in open market consultations with potential tenderers and end-users to identify gaps between perceived procurement needs and current industry developments. Feedback from these consultations will inform the PPI tender specifications, ensuring that the PPI emphasizes the early adoption of innovative solutions rather than the procurement of fully mature or mass-market technologies. The market readiness of the solutions can be verified through conformity testing, certification, or quality labelling. The work will also involve establishing evaluation criteria based on best-value-for-money rather than solely on the lowest price, ensuring that innovations are assessed for both their technical performance and their potential to deliver long-term value.\nThe PPI contract notices will be published EU-wide, with offers evaluated on objective criteria, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection process. Functional/performance-based specifications will be used to define the challenges and problems to be solved, rather than prescriptive solutions, and procurement will avoid any conflicts of interest. The distribution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) will be clearly outlined in the PPI call for tenders, in line with the objective of promoting fair and wide exploitation of the results.\nThe process to be followed for the preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender is described in General Annex H.\nBy fostering the early adoption of innovative technologies, this PPI initiative will enable the European civil security sector to address emerging threats, while contributing to the EU’s broader goals of technological sovereignty and market innovation. This will allow public authorities to remain at the forefront of addressing evolving risks and threats. The action will also catalyse innovation, drive competition, and significantly reduce the time needed to move from the initial concept to market.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] For more information see General Annex H of Horizon Europe Work Programme – Specific Conditions for Actions with PCP/PPI.",

          "scope": "Today’s global economy and high-volume trade flows require much and fast transport to deliver products worldwide. Traders and consumers expect quick and easy transactions, while customs administrations face the challenge of controlling the goods without disrupting their flow. This is exploited by organised crime and terrorist organisations, which take advantage of the large amount of goods to conceal threats or illegal and/or dangerous materials in legal commercial cargo, with the aim of causing damage, disruption, or of it illegally crossing borders unnoticed.\nCustoms authorities must ensure a high level of compliance with both security and revenue objectives: trafficked materials may represent a threat, and undetected smuggled licit materials entering the EU deprive the Member States of the revenue due if the material had been legally traded. In addition, illegal trafficking can have an impact in the environment (such as biodiversity loss or deforestation) or for the EU citizens’ safety and health.\nThe air and maritime cargo contexts present security challenges as well as high potential consequences of threats, primarily but not limited to explosives and incendiary devices. Air cargo can represent continuity assurances to cope, at least in the short term and for critical lines, with supply chain and/or distribution crises; while maritime cargo remains the most common transport mode in global trade. The risk for well-concealed materials not being detected during screening, or the risk of concealment during the supply chain is pressing.\nLogistical hubs also need to strengthen their capabilities to adapt to sudden changes, and customs authorities need to mobilise their available resources to ensure efficient and fast controls. The need for better mobility and improved agility for customs is accompanied by the need to deploy scalable solutions, that are interoperable with other systems to facilitate co-sharing of equipment between BCPs and between Member States.\nInnovation actions funded under this topic should develop and test solutions for cargo security, relevant to one or more transport modes (maritime, air, postal, road, or rail); and usable at one (or more) crucial point(s) of the supply chain. Innovation can also develop enhanced capabilities for customs to detect illicit, regulated and / or dangerous goods and transactions, and to be able to effectively characterise them in a timely manner. Improved tracking and tracing capabilities will facilitate the seizing of the materials while contributing to collecting data and evidence to further support investigations and prosecutions.\nProposals are expected to address one of the following options that should be explicitly selected:\nOption a: security of cargo\nOption b: detection of smuggled and trafficked goods/materials in cargo\nDetection capabilities should target one or more type(s) of dangerous, illicit and/or illegal goods or materials, including: explosive or incendiary devices; illicit drugs and their precursors; illegally traded species, including covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and considering the Regulation on Deforestation-free Products [1] ; illegally traded cultural property; contraband; trafficked weapons; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRN-E) material or precursors; F-gases; and/or various modi operandi related to cross-border trafficking, including involving cargo.\nWhere the identification of illegal goods cannot be achieved without opening containers (for example, in the case of species or their parts), and where imagery, chemical, or molecular tests are required, appropriate measures should be established to reduce the response time between sampling and expert assessment, thereby minimizing disruption to the flow of goods.\nExamples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research actions include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): smart active defuse systems, sensors, artificial intelligence, tracking and tracing systems, distributed ledger technologies, non-intrusive inspection, automated threat recognition systems, and screening and scanning systems.\nEquipment and technologies enabling increased security of cargo should contribute to cost and energy efficiency, limit their environmental impact and being more sustainable when they will be taken up in the future. An increased security of air cargo, furthermore, should not be regarded as an incentive to use air transport when this has a higher environmental and emissions impact, but prioritised on critical supply lines and/or situations.\nProposals received under this topic should demonstrate how the project would integrate the perspective for the whole supply chain, from load to delivery. Proposed solutions should be interoperable with the different relevant equipment and systems deployed by the customs authorities. Proposals should demonstrate how their solutions would align with existing interoperability standards (if any), and consider issues of cybersecurity and EU technological sovereignty and strategic autonomy. Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to align with the customs reform (if adopted) and customs policy priorities, and the projects should, once started, align with the policy priorities of the proposed EU Customs Authority and its Data Hub (if established).\nCoordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.\nResearch projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.\nProposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals. The results of the research should be taken up by EU customs authorities with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI) and/or subsequent funding opportunities, or the proposed EU Customs Authority and its Data Hub (once established).\nSynergies within civil security can be an asset, for example with Better protect the EU and its citizens against Crime and Terrorism and Resilient Infrastructure.\n[1] https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en",

Furthermore, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project.

Proposals should explore innovative and inclusive approaches in police education, training and management that go beyond traditional models, resulting in an effective engagement with a diversifying society. Proposals should also seek to identify and develop effective practices and training programs that encourage a deeper understanding of diversity among police personnel and integrate a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach when relevant. In addition, proposals should assess how effective cooperation with Civil Society Organizations (or Non-Governmental Organisations) - representing various communities - can enhance reporting mechanisms, reduce hate crimes, and strengthen trust and cooperation between the police and the population. By improving police-citizen relations across diverse European contexts, the proposals should aim to contribute to enhanced security and social stability in Europe. Proposals’ findings should generate valuable insights applicable to varied policing environments, ultimately informing police forces across Europe about non-violent conflict resolution and constructive engagement strategies. Through collaborative research and training, proposals should equip Police Authorities with the tools, skills and methodologies necessary to effectively serve and engage with diverse communities, foster social cohesion, and build trust throughout Europe.\nActivities proposed within this topic should address the issue from various angles, combining social sciences with technological development and applications in a logical manner.\nTherefore, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Furthermore, if the proposals concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding.

As these substances increasingly influence the drug landscape, the urgent need for enhanced understanding and strategies in their prevention, treatment, and harm reduction has never been clearer. Amongst other, there is also a lack of pharmacological data for the emerging drugs, needed to do proper risk assessments and interventions of these drugs in Europe. Key focus areas include:\n- Evidence-based approaches, strengthening the evidence base to inform effective prevention strategies, treatment modalities, and harm reduction practices targeted at synthetic drugs and stimulants. This includes identifying best practices in current interventions and evaluating their efficacy.\n- Reducing violence and offending exploring strategies to mitigate the violence and criminal behaviour associated with the use and marketing of synthetic drugs. This involves understanding the socio-economic and cultural factors, including the gender, age, or other social factors, that contribute to these phenomena and proposing targeted interventions.\n- Improving technologies and tools to combat drug trafficking from its origin to destination (i.e., through the entire supply chain).\n- External drivers of change, analysing the impact of geopolitical situations, legal frameworks, and societal factors on the availability and consumption of various drugs, and addressing how international crises affect organised crime and drug markets in the EU. This includes investigating the repercussions of global developments on local drug dynamics and identifying adaptive response strategies.\nIn light of the underdeveloped evidence base surrounding synthetic drugs, proposals should aim to foster collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and security practitioners to create a comprehensive and effective response to this pressing issue in Europe, previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects.

          "scope": "Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.\nHowever, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and Intellectual Property (IP) valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.\nKnowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users, taking into account the urge to address the diverse needs of all citizens, regardless of gender, age or ability.\nApplicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:\n- Focus on mature technological solutions addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme;\n- Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries;\n- Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations;\n- Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.\nExamples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.\nThe participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.\nIt is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role [1] . If the coordinator is not an SME, this should be duly justified.\nThe projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.\nUnder this topic, projects should address one of the following areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme: Fighting Crime and Terrorism (FCT, Option A), Disaster-Resilient Society (DRS, Option B), Resilient Infrastructure (INFRA, Option C), Border Management (BM, Option D).\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the FCT area are: mobile forensics; deepfake detection; detection of counterfeiting (fake items, fake currency bills) or falsified/forged documents (passports, ID cards); detection and countering of advanced forms of malware, as well as non-cash payment frauds and other cyber-scams.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the DRS area are: data and satellite/remote sensing information exploitation, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance for disaster prevention.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the INFRA area are: physical access control, autonomous systems used for infrastructure protection, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance of environments and activities.\nSome (indicative and non-exhaustive) examples of domains that could be addressed under the BM area are: facilitated border checks; secure documents and identity management for border crossings; border surveillance; detection of drugs, explosives, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), weapons and/or other dangerous materials in customs environment; detection of stolen, smuggled, illicit or illegal goods (cigarettes, art, cultural goods, wildlife) in a customs environment.\nWhere relevant, proposals are invited to consider legal aspects to support the operationalization, policy integration, and institutional transformation of security solutions. This might include, for instance, the design of legal, policy, and/or standardization pathways to support the operational uptake of security solutions.\nThis topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP [2] ) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation” [3] . This topic contributes to the objectives stated in the STEP Regulation, e.g., to support the European industry and boost investment in critical technologies in Europe, and, to contribute to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] If a MIDCAP is included in the proposal, it could also take the role of coordinator.\n[2] OJ L, 2024/795, 29.2.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/795/oj\n[3] https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/index_en",

          "scope": "As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&D) services and innovative civil security technology solutions.\nProposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals are expected to include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise proposals that should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project.\nThe proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous Horizon Europe work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies . The proposals should provide clear evidence to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It should be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project. The tender process to be followed is described in Annex H.\nProposals should demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects should be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is recommendable to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:\n- Procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.\n- Launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.\n- Adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).\n- Foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).\nIn these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP [1] . In the first case, the procurers should foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers should foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users that are not part of the consortium (e.g. citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly hardware components, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.\nApplicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:\n- A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.\n- Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2026-2027, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call expects proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.\n- Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;\n- Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.\n- Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.\nApplicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.\nFinally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.\n[1] See General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.",
