Current state-of-the-art technologies have already paved the way for more streamlined operations, yet there remains untapped value in e.g. quality improvement, definition of optimal process operating conditions, reduction of scrap, optimization of energy usage. Real-time monitoring and adaptive optimisation using AI models can enable agile responses to production variability and support sustained, high-performance operations.\nNew solutions based on innovative enabling technologies such as deep learning, large language models, digital twins, synthetic data, and data-driven models allow manufacturers to improve production system efficiency, elevate product quality, and proactively address critical challenges in energy consumption and carbon footprint. This dual focus on operational excellence and sustainability ensures that factories can maintain competitive advantage while also contributing to specific environmental goals, e.g. reducing the pressure on ecosystems and natural resources. Since innovation capacity and competitiveness also requires a systemic understanding of an organization’s value creating structure, novel AI solutions should be implemented such that they can support all structures and phases of operation, in technical and non-technical terms.\nProposals should produce dedicated innovative explainable AI based solutions in advanced manufacturing for at least two of the following:\n- improve processes and operational efficiency, and reduce climate and environmental impact of processes and factories through dynamic selection of optimal processes and production parameters, exploiting AI for process modelling and/or optimisation;\n- avoid the production of defective parts using AI to detect process drift and anomalies and correct proactively defects in real time; and\n- maximise the fraction of regenerated components or materials used in the production using AI to optimise the material flow.\nProposals should demonstrate potential for these AI tools to adapt to changing production needs and real-time data, and should describe how industrial data access, confidentiality, and secure data-sharing will be addressed.\nProjects are encouraged to link with AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in Testing and Experiment Facilities (TEFs), and further deployed via European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nProposals can optionally address the conditions for implementing the novel AI solutions within an organisations structure and value creating models, thereby contributing to systemic approach of implementing a smart organisation.\nThis topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.",

Creation of a comprehensive framework for general purpose and flexible robotics skills development with industry-relevant challenges, evaluation metrics and success criteria.\n- Facilitation of widespread deployment of robotics in manufacturing especially SMEs, through modular, adaptable, and reconfigurable solutions built on robotics foundation models, to meet evolving production needs",
          "scope": "The proposed project aims to significantly enhance robotics capabilities in manufacturing by developing advanced robotics skills (for example, task and environment aware autonomous pick and place with high precision and speed, human-robot collaboration, etc).\nBy leveraging the use of next-generation AI, including generative AI, to enable robots to better adapt to real-world environments and interact with human operators, and focusing on reconfigurability, the project will develop industry-agnostic solutions that can be easily adapted to different manufacturing environments.\nThe project will create a comprehensive framework for robotics skills development in manufacturing, including the initial definition of three technical challenges that must be clearly described at proposal stage, with evidence of their industrial relevance and potential impact. The detailed specification and design of these challenges may be further refined during the first phase of the project in collaboration with industry partners.\nThe project will organize a multi-stage competition for each of the three identified technical challenges. Each stage of the competition is expected to present an increased level of complexity compared to the previous one. The approach for designing the competitive process, including the use of FSTP, should aim at maximising the impact.\nOne of the key use cases for this project will be the automotive industry, which should be explicitly included in proposals either as a primary focus or as a dedicated use case, demonstrating how advanced robotics can enhance production efficiency and adaptability in this sector. Other use cases alongside the automotive one are allowed and encouraged, to demonstrate the industry-agnostic nature and the transferability of the developed solutions to different industrial contexts.\nUser-industry companies from the manufacturing sector (including automotive) should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and actively support the FSTP recipients in achieving powerful and exploitable results that benefit their industry.\nOrganization of the Challenge:\nStage 1 – Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection of the 10 highest-ranked proposals for each of the three technical robotics skills, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, research organisation or public body secondary or higher education establishment, developer of robotics solutions, or a small team of organizations.\nStage 2 – Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 will receive a EUR 200,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 3 highest-ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 – Grand Finale (competition among Stage 2 winners): The 3 best teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 will receive a EUR 1,000,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges defined for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the team winning the grand finale in maximising the impact and uptake of its solutions.\nProposals must include a draft exploitation plan outlining how the solutions developed by the FSTP recipients will be taken up, with concrete support from the user-industry partners to ensure industrial relevance and future exploitation.\nThis scheme is repeated for each of the three technical challenges.\nThe consortium will ensure high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships, and will seek to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.",

Activities also include analyses of investor-readiness and supply-chain sovereignty.\n- Phase 2: For further information, see the indirectly managed action “HORIZON-CL4 Quantum Top-Up to InvestEU: Grand Challenge Phase 2” in the Cluster 4 part of the Horizon Europe 2026/2027 Work Programme. This CSA is designed to allow the best possible application in Phase 2 and the current CSA results may therefore inform applications by beneficiaries to investment support managed by the EIB under InvestEU (separate procedures).\nUnder Phase 1 projects are expected to establish a comprehensive technical and financial roadmap that demonstrates the potential of the proposed Q-INS solutions, and at least deliver evidence-based design and benchmarking packages for reduced-scale systems ( such as documentation, test/benchmark reports and evidence of pre-existing or externally financed prototypes) in one of the following two categories:\n- Category 1 (cold-atoms Q-INS) : Q-INS based on cold-atom interferometry (or other technology of at least equivalent performance) featuring long-term navigation accuracy (<10 m/hour) due to reduced drift with respect to commercial Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). End-user requirements together with documented benchmark evidence from existing or externally financed prototypes will be collected for demonstrations in maritime or aviation applications.\n- Category 2 ( Chip-scale Q-INS ): Low C-SWAP Q-INS measuring acceleration, rotation rate, and/or magnetic field, aimed at the implementation of chip-scale sensors based on defect centers and vacancies in crystals or on warm atomic vapours (including nuclear magnetic resonance), for applications e.g. in small satellites, UAVs, and autonomous transport.\nProposals should target systems that are already sufficiently mature to enable credible benchmarking and industrial road-mapping. Specific expected outcomes include:\n- A detailed technical roadmap, including system architecture, integration strategy, performance milestones, risk assessments and industrialisation plan for scalable production\n- The industrialisation plan should be validated in conjunction with the EIB requirements, including commercialization timelines, and should include at least the following: Detailed Q-INS architecture based on quantum sensing techniques hybridised with classical IMUs, Compliance assessment for SWaP-C requirements, environmental resilience, and real-world integration, An assessment of dependencies on non-EU suppliers of critical components and proposal of effective mitigation measures in view of a sovereign supply chain, Potential list of end-users to capture system requirements and use-case constraints\n- A comprehensive financial roadmap and viability assessment covering business models, market analyses, commercialization pathways, revenue projections and investment criteria\n- Documented lab-validation/benchmarking of an existing or externally financed prototype (no EU funding of R&I or prototype development in this CSA), with preliminary benchmark results.\n- An application strategy identifying target sectors (maritime, aviation, space, autonomous systems) and quantifiable advantages over classical IMUs.",
          "scope": "The Grand Challenge on Quantum Sensors for Inertial Navigation aims to advance the development of quantum-enabled navigation systems for use in GNSS-denied or contested environments. Q-INS combines quantum sensors with classical inertial measurement subsystems to deliver reliable, resilient, and sovereign positioning capabilities. The topic supports the EU’s ambition to strengthen technological sovereignty in strategic navigation infrastructures, aligned with the objectives of the STEP and the Digital Decade.\nUnder this topic (Phase 1), projects are expected to deliver a comprehensive technical, industrialisation, and financial roadmap, including criteria for investment readiness, bankability, risk assessment, and scalability, thereby laying the groundwork for future investments via EU financial instruments under InvestEU, which benefits from a dedicated top-up from Horizon Europe for this purpose [1] .\nUnder Phase 1, Expressions of Interest from potential end-user partners are strongly encouraged. Tailored advisory services from EIB Advisory may support financial structuring to prepare for Phase 2.\nProjects funded under this action are expected to span approximately six months, with an EU contribution up to EUR 0.5 million.\n[1] HORIZON-CL4 Indirectly managed action “Quantum Top-Up to InvestEU: Grand Challenge Phase 2”",

This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.\nUser industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide to the competing FSTP recipients the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small team of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\n- Stage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow to select for Stage 2 the 20 highest-ranked proposals, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations led by such SME\n- Stage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 20 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\n- Stage 3– Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,000,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, an amount of EUR 5,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge.\nThe proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects [1] and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy [2] .\n[1] In particular, proposals in telecommunication should exploit potential synergies with projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08, HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-09 and HORIZON-CL4-2025-04-DATA-02; proposals in pharma/drug should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from Cluster 1 and IHI Innovative Health Initiative; proposals in the aerospace should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from the clean aviation JU and other similar projects/initiatives.\n[2] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy.",

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:\n- Significant improvements in the autonomy, robustness and reliability of AI agents through advanced planning mechanisms, memory management, and reasoning capabilities.\n- Innovative multi-agent frameworks and protocols demonstrating effective decentralized coordination and collaboration among multiple AI agents beyond the capabilities of individual agents.",
          "scope": "Next-generation AI agents are autonomous systems powered by large AI language models (e.g., large language models or large multimodal models), that can plan, utilize tools and perform actions autonomously to achieve specified goals based on high-level instructions. The large AI model acts as the agent's \"brain,\" capable of interpreting instructions, generating plans, and using tools. This capability enables agents to autonomously plan and adapt behaviour in real-time to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. AI Agents hold significant promise in numerous applications areas such as data analytics and coding.\nEffective AI agents require careful design, incorporating structured planning and reasoning methods to manage complex tasks, and be equipped with appropriate validation and monitoring techniques. Multi-agent collaboration frameworks further enhance capabilities by enabling structured interactions among multiple agents.\nKey aspects in designing effective AI agents include robust planning, reasoning, and search mechanisms that allow agents to approach complex tasks by breaking them down into structured subgoals. Effective memory and state management are necessary to maintaining coherent long-term interactions, achieved through a balanced integration of short-term and external long-term memory solutions. Moreover, integrating external tools and APIs is essential for overcoming limitations in large AI models, enhancing agent performance in tasks requiring accuracy and reliability.\nPotential research areas include enhancing AI agent autonomy through advanced self-planning and self-optimization capabilities, enabling agents to improve their decision-making and strategic planning. Other research directions include innovation in memory-augmented AI agents to facilitate robust long-term reasoning and lifelong learning; developing advanced multi-agent frameworks specifically tailored for collaborative agents, including research on AI agent frameworks based on mixed AI architectures, and advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities to enable real-world applications.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.

Material production becomes less dependent on imports and / or use of non-renewable materials by improving recovery along the value chain, developing and upscaling low-CO2 processes to recover materials, including to replace current efficient but CO2-intensive recycling.\nThe continuity and high resource demand for materials and energy of industrial processes need dependable availability of resources. The attainment of this target requires moving away from primary, often expensive, and rare resources, by the re-integration and valorisation of secondary resources (end-of-use waste) and industrial side-streams into the process industries as feedstock. Priority should be given to streams that contain critical and insufficiently available raw materials, and to streams with a large carbon footprint or a large required energy input for their production.\nThe development of technologies should encompass the entire value chain from the collection, dismantling, sorting and separation of waste to the processing of the streams and the production of new high-quality materials. The demonstration of the innovative, efficient, and economically viable technologies is required, considering a scale and conditions that can give reliable indications on the real-world economic potential.

This can include development / improvement of end-of-life recycling processes targeting waste, scrap, dust and sludges for possible use for high-performance high-reliability products;\n- Recover relevant secondary raw materials, including critical ones, and target maximum process efficiency;\n- Reduce the usage of scarce and critical raw materials in the production processes, while at the same time preserving ecosystem and reducing pressures on biodiversity that would be caused by extraction;\n- Reduce the number of manufacturing stages by shortening of production processes, leading to a reduction in the energy consumption; and/or consider approaches/technologies for optimising efficiency in terms of water use.\n- Understand the effect of specific contaminants on the properties of materials produced from secondary feedstock and develop technologies for their removal if needed, also in view of the need for pre-treatment and secondary manufacturing steps.\n- Where relevant, include analytical techniques for micro- and/or nano-characterisation of materials to gain the necessary knowledge to influence processes and allow dedicated modelling.\nShowcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale. Digitalisation should be included when effective, but it must not be targeted independently from the development and validation of the necessary process technologies.\nThe re-integration of side streams in the production cycle can take place within one sector or across sectors (industrial symbiosis).

This involves optimising the integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion processes.\n- Demonstrate processes that minimize energy consumption during the entire conversion process, leveraging advances in process integration that can shift equilibria and the use of renewable electricity and available heat sources.\n- Contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions by enabling the sustainable use of CO2, supporting circular economy principles through the valorisation of CO2, possibly aligned with CCS.",
          "scope": "There are only a few products that can be competitively produced from CO2. Increased opportunities for CCU from process industry emissions require the development of a larger portfolio of potential CO2-derived products. The higher cost of CO2-based products compared to conventional production routes is mostly driven by the high energy demand arising from the thermodynamic constraints of CO2. The smart integration of CO2 capture, purification and conversion can enable process optimisation with reduced energy consumption as well as reduced capital expenditure. Additionally, innovative processes can overcome the inherent equilibrium limitations of CCU production. The development of new integrated processes can be an opportunity to optimise the use of electricity, make use of available heat sources and relevant infrastructures and thus accelerate the development of CO2 valorisation.\nProposals under this topic are expected to address several of the following points:\n- Develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for the smart integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion, focusing on reducing energy demand, capital expenditure and possible integration with CCS infrastructure requirements.\n- Incorporate renewable energy sources (including the fluctuation of energy availability) and innovative energy management strategies to enhance the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the CO2 valorisation processes.\n- Identify and integrate available heat sources and existing infrastructures to enhance process efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n- Address the constraints related to CO2 conversion processes, employing innovative approaches to maximize yield and process efficiency, for example by overcoming low equilibrium yields.\n- Conduct comprehensive lifecycle and economic assessments to ensure that the proposed solutions are viable, sustainable, and economically attractive.\nConversion of CO2 to methanol and fuels is considered outside the scope of this topic.\nShowcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale.\nThe inclusion of a GHG avoidance methodology [1] is recommended and should provide detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. Proposals should consider representative real industrial sites demonstrating the solutions at least in open-loop computations. This should be done in parallel to the actual operation of the plants with validation of the benefits by simulations with accurate models. Experiments involving real industrial sites are encouraged. Societal- and environmental impact as well as implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European partnership Processes4Planet.\n[1] That could follow Innovation Fund methodology: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf",

          "scope": "The scope of this topic is to support the deployment of secure, interoperable, and scalable data management systems, ensuring seamless cross-sector data integration, automation of key processes, and compliance with EU frameworks.\nThe actions should deliver high-quality, well-structured, secure and compliant data, tailored to evolving societal, industrial, research and public sector needs, underpinning key EU strategies, including the Data Union Strategy, the Apply AI Strategy, the Digital Justice Strategy, and the development of Common European Data Spaces, Data Labs and EuroHPC systems (including the AI Factories). The developed methods, technologies and tools should ensure that data is effectively shared between sectors, disciplines, and participating countries, and that the data is reliable, traceable, and fit for purpose.\nThe proposal should clearly state (in the abstract and in the introduction) which of the following two areas it addresses. A proposal can address both areas, but it should indicate one of them as the main focus of the proposal, as it will be evaluated accordingly under that area:\n- Area 1: The actions under this area should support the development and deployment of advanced, AI-driven compliance technologies and solutions that automate data transactions and key regulatory processes, reduce administrative burdens, and facilitate seamless adherence to EU rules . This includes RegTech/GovTech//LegalTech applications such as digital tools offering real-time compliance guidance, automated rule-drafting assistants for policymakers, and multilingual chatbots providing regulatory support to businesses and professionals. Predictive analytics and risk-based approaches should allow tailored compliance pathways, while integration with national systems and the Single Digital Gateway should promote cross-border mutual recognition and application of the Once-Only Principle. Public administrations should be equipped with automated compliance assessment tools, real-time analytics dashboards, and interoperability frameworks to enhance and streamline regulatory oversight and cooperation. The technologies and solutions should contribute to the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency in AI-driven compliance solutions, including traceability and explainability of automated actions.\n- The solutions under Area 1 should adhere to open technical standards, ensuring scalability, inclusiveness, and co-development with private and public stakeholders. Robust cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, trust safeguards, security and privacy cryptographic protection, including via post-quantum cryptography, should be embedded, aligning with EU data protection and digital identity frameworks. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models should be harnessed, to the extent possible/reasonable, to enable data-driven feedback loops that support continuous policy learning, allowing regulators to monitor rule implementation, identify unnecessary burdens, and simplify legislation based on real-time evidence. Where appropriate, the actions under this Area should build on and integrate the privacy-enhancing (including anonymization) technologies developed under earlier topics in the Horizon Europe programme.\n- Area 2: The actions under this area should focus on the design and deployment of secure, scalable, and adaptive data management systems that automate key data processes , such as data curation, metadata tagging, ontology management and discovery, labelling, annotation, and quality control, developing and adapting appropriate AI methods and tools for these specific tasks. These systems should facilitate seamless integration and sharing of data across sectors and disciplines, ensuring interoperability, data provenance, data privacy and handling secured against emerging quantum threats via post-quantum cryptography, and compliance with applicable EU legal frameworks. Special emphasis is on enhancing data accuracy, representativeness, and relevance, particularly for use cases in industry, public services, citizen engagement, and the development of trustworthy AI applications, as well as the Common European Data Spaces. The development of such high-quality, semantically rich datasets will be essential to unlock the full potential of AI across domains.\n- Furthermore, the actions under Area 2 may also support the generation and use of high-quality synthetic data, including spatial synthetic data, to complement real-world datasets while preserving data privacy via advanced, state-of-the-art cryptographic protection. This may include, among others, the use of AI-enabled generative graphics pipelines to automate the creation of large-scale simulated environments and the application of parallelised and/or neuromorphic computing techniques to train AI models and artificial agents efficiently.\nThe actions under both areas should take into account the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre, particularly the blueprint for common European data spaces, and build synergies with related Union initiatives such as AI Factories, European Blockchain Services infrastructure, and the European Business Wallet, as well as with sector-specific Common European Data Spaces, and EU Digital Identity Wallet large scale pilots. Close collaboration with relevant European Partnerships, stakeholders, including industry, public administrations, and research organisations, will ensure that the systems meet the practical needs of data users while fostering innovation, competitiveness, and digital sovereignty within the Single Market.",

          "scope": "Innovative AI approaches are poised to revolutionise human-machine collaboration in factories by fostering an environment where technology and human expertise synergistically enhance each other. AI can enhance the value of the companies by capturing and formalising the knowledge which is dispersed and not explicit. This allows companies to really own the knowledge and use it to reduce the onboarding time of new employees and support personnel upskilling to adapt to the evolving technological landscape. AI has a great potential to make task simpler by reducing the complexity offering intuitive interfaces and real-time feedback allowing workforce to be more efficient and effective while facilitating access to more complex tasks including those involving various forms of planning. AI can also adapt the interaction of automation with the worker taking into account particular needs of the human, including adaptation to the different abilities of the workers and facilitating inclusion. Finally, AI can be used to allow easier export of automation produced in EU by facilitating its interaction with workforce having different cultures adapting the interaction of the machines to the different needs.\nProposals should produce dedicated innovative AI approaches for human-machine collaboration in advanced manufacturing to be applied in at least two of following fields:\n- Human-AI Co-Learning and knowledge capture to share competences, capture expert knowledge, provide interactive mentoring to up-skill the workforce, and support re-qualification and continuous training – leading to increased knowledge at factory level and avoiding loss of know-how.\n- Human-AI teamwork thanks to innovative natural interaction models (considering the e.g. related hardware interfaces and/or collaborative machine tools), enabling to control complexity in cognitive cooperating production systems, including planning activities at shop floor level.\n- Interfaces with automation which automatically adapt to the need of the humans including different abilities and different cultural needs.\nProposals should integrate a gender perspective and avoid any type of discrimination in the design and deployment of AI systems and human-machine interaction models, including addressing differences in user needs, such as needs of persons with disabilities, physical and cognitive ergonomics and training pathways. Proposals are also expected to identify and address other potential biases in AI systems to promote inclusive design that ensures safe and effective use by all workers. Human/AI collaboration requires utmost sensitivity to and consideration of human values and consideration of ethical principles as represented in Digital Humanism, therefore, appropriate consideration must also be given to the contribution of SSH.\nThis topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.\nIn addition, proposals are invited to build on the results of past projects on Extended Reality Technologies (XR), such as HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-13, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-14, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-25, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-06, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-28.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.",

Key features of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud network include programmability, fast service creation, security and privacy, mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain deployments. 3C/ telco-edge-cloud networks enable innovative use cases for an EU Digital Market that integrate communication, collaboration and computing capabilities in competitive and sustainable business models that will reinforce EU competitiveness and contribute to digital sovereignty, in particular through the use of Open Internet Stack components. Resulting solutions should be available for use in the public sector (for instance for justice systems).\nThe 3C Network large-scale pilot funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08: Large-scale pilots for supply end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities for Telco Edge Cloud deployments, as a basis for Connected Collaborative Computing Networks (3C networks) (RIA) is setting up end-to-end integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond.

As a main outcome the supply side pilot establishes an open orchestration platform across the telco-cloud-edge continuum, exploits the transformative value of AI and builds on the integration of solutions developed by the Open Euro Stack.\nDemand- side pilot demonstrators called in this topic will build on the above supply side large-scale pilot and integrate future domain-specific applications and services with an emerging European 3Cs/ telco-edge-cloud infrastructure, leveraging different network features. Key features will include security and privacy solutions offering resistance to emerging quantum threats (such as via post-quantum cryptography), mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain and multi-cloud deployments and ecosystems.\nUp to two pilot demonstrators on below listed specific verticals are expected .\n- One pilot demonstrator focusing on Mobility covering specific areas of transport, logistics and the Automotive industry. The pilot should support the strategy as developed by the Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance identified in the Automotive Action plan , in particular Pillars 3 (AI models) and 5 (Large-scale testing), which will be launched in 2025.\n- One pilot demonstrator focusing on another vertical sector such as energy, smart communities, industrial virtual worlds, health, agrifood or manufacturing.\nThey would be driven by a consortium including partners both from the demand (user) and infrastructure supply side. The pilot demonstrators should take advantage of open application interfaces, explore the possibilities of AI, “virtual worlds”, and other innovative technologies for practical implementation in the referred vertical domains. They should leverage combined investments in network infrastructure, computing and connectivity infrastructure as an enabler for more extensive set of digital innovation, with cognitive cloud computing and swarm intelligence, generative AI and LLM, as well as on-boarding of XR/AR technologies, being ranked most important.\nProposals are expected to detail a robust data governance model for the data generated and processed within the pilots. This model should address data sovereignty, interoperability with Common European Data Spaces, and alignment with principles from initiatives like Gaia-X. It should outline clear mechanisms for secure and compliant data sharing between the demand-side (users) and supply-side (infrastructure providers), establishing the trust necessary for a functional data economy on top of the 3C infrastructure.\nPilot demonstrators should demonstrate the evolution from virtualised and cloud-native network functions towards automated network operations enabling agile and green IoT-edge computing solutions and decentralised intelligence. They should also demonstrate benefits for infrastructure providers to operate networks more efficiently and move beyond traditional connectivity-service models to higher value-added services.\nDemonstrations will respond to the ever more demanding processing power of AI through integration on-device level and changes triggered by GenAI affecting global communication infrastructures. Orchestration of workloads across the telco-cloud-edge continuum from distributed sensors and actuators to the edge and cloud is a crucial part of innovation as AI becomes more resource-intensive.\nThe pilot demonstrators should take into consideration the recommendations on user requirements from the advisory group of end users, as well as liaise with the collaboration and support action (CSA) funded under WP25 to bridge between the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply pilot funded under WP25 and the demand pilots funded under WP26-27.\nThe pilots should exploit in particular open APIs and open-source components as developed by the supply side pilot, e.g. including the use of capabilities to implement specific communication management services (e.g. Open RAN security, RIC VNF…), up-take of existing standards and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, ANUKET, Nephio, CAMARA, etc.).\nThe pilot demonstrators should include testing, validation and demonstration of prototypes of agile virtualised network functions combined with ubiquitous mesh of integrated devices, computing and communication resources in operational environments, ensuring security and privacy, protection also in the face of emerging quantum threats, energy efficiency, transparency and control of the ecological footprint, as well as sustainable artificial intelligence services.\nThe pilot demonstrators are expected to re-use as far as possible existing open-source frameworks, i.e. open-source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key technology components for the operation of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply-side large scale pilot. These open-source frameworks should be made available to the Open Internet Stack Support for Scale.\nThe proposals should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant vertical sectors, with a particular attention to the involvement of SMEs, scale-ups and start-ups.\nThe pilots should establish a high degree of relations and collaborate with complementary EU funded research activities, like the Smart Networks and Systems Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) projects, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Sovereign edge/cloud infrastructure” R&I areas, the PPP virtual worlds, CCAM partnership as well as support of SW-defined vehicle initiative under the Chips JU.",

With challenges designed to spark breakthroughs in such strategic sectors, the current topic will directly support key activities of the Apply AI Strategy.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI Strategy's prioritised sectors driven by challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions.\n- Increase competitiveness and visibility of the relevant AI community within key application domains, and promote collaborative approaches for AI development in these domains, fostering the ecosystem.\n- Increase adoption of AI technologies across the following three key application domains: healthcare, advanced manufacturing (including AI-powered robotics) and in-vehicle autonomous driving.",
          "scope": "The Challenge-Driven AI Innovation Booster aims to drive significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI prioritised sectors through challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions. This initiative seeks to boost Europe's developer community and the adoption of powerful, trustworthy AI solutions in three strategic domains such as:\n- In healthcare - advanced AI will accelerate diagnostics and treatment plans, enhance robotic surgery, or improve patient care through predictive analytics.\n- In advanced manufacturing - advanced AI will optimize production processes, improve quality control and product design, or enable predictive maintenance.\n- In autonomous driving - advanced AI will enhance vehicle safety, improve navigation systems, or optimize traffic management. Provided sufficient quality of the proposals received, at least one selected project will focus on in-vehicle autonomous driving applications, in line with the Automotive Action Plan, ensuring coordination with the announced Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above.\nIt is expected to focus primarily on the definition and organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as on the accompanying support to the SMEs/teams taking part in each of the challenges.\nUser-industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in each consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and therefore support the challenge participants to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefiting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive, but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan focused on how the solutions developed by the third parties will be taken up, with support from the user-industry partners for their future exploitation.\nThe consortium leading the project is responsible for the various stages of the challenges. This consortium should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition (including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy) and, most importantly, the consortium should ensure that the teams competing for and receiving financial support to third parties have access to relevant data to fine-tune models and build high-impact solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where advanced AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with advanced AI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, each project consortium should organize a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small teams of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with advanced AI solutions.\nFor each proposal:\nStage 1 - Open call: The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection for Stage 2 of the 10 highest-ranked proposals according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution is expected to be submitted either by a single SME, developer of advanced AI solutions, or a small team of organizations led by such SME.\nStage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners: The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive a EUR 300,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest-ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\nStage 3 – Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners): The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,250,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.\nThe consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best-performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.\nSuch a multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, and propose a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants in the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.\nThe projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organizing the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organizing dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalized by a collaboration agreement after the grant agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, a total of EUR 3,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, EUR 9,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives and expected results. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.\nVisibility would be important; therefore, dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.\n[1] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy",

As part of the Frontier AI Initiative, which brings together Europe’s leading actors in the field, this topic will support the development of sovereign frontier AI ensuring safety by design. This topic directly contributes to the Apply AI Strategy. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Strengthened European capabilities in the development of frontier AI models.\n- Improved computational efficiency of frontier AI models, resulting in reduced computational costs.\n- Enhanced safety of advanced AI systems based on frontier AI models through the development and implementation of safe-by-design principles and/or AI agents acting as safety evaluators.",
          "scope": "To advance developments of frontier AI models towards highest-level performance, while ensuring energy efficiency, addressing computational constraints, and strengthening safety. The approach of this topic is twofold. First, it aims to advance the AI field through the development and training of a frontier AI model. The AI model should demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, have multimodal capabilities, and be optimized for agentic AI capabilities such as tool use, reasoning, and autonomous problem-solving. Second, this topic supports research on comprehensive methods to reduce the computational demands of frontier AI models and to ensure their safety, including technical methodologies such as automated testing and interpretability.\nThe primary drivers behind computational efficient AI systems are the urgent challenges posed by the growing energy footprint of AI and current computational limitations. Modern AI models, especially frontier AI models, require substantial computational resources, with a significant impact in the environment. Additionally, they create barriers to entry to those interested in advancing the AI field. Key research areas include compression and distillation techniques aimed at reducing the complexity of large AI models. Innovations in AI architectures are also relevant, with a focus on innovative models that significantly lower computational demands for training and inference. Further, algorithmic approaches aimed at minimizing computational load during pre-training, post-training, and inference can also be considered.\nEnsuring the safety of AI systems is essential, especially as AI models become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. Potential research areas to be considered include addressing misalignment, particularly the unintentional misalignment of large AI models. Work in this area could explore methods to detect and mitigate sophisticated misbehaviour, such as alignment faking, reward hacking of human oversight, and encoded reasoning in chain-of-thought (CoT). Additionally, research could focus on enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, jailbreaks, and backdoors. Further potential areas for innovation include advancing AI models transparency and interpretability. Safety research could also consider risks that may arise when embedding frontier models within agentic AI frameworks, significantly contributing to the trust and safe adoption of powerful AI solutions.\nThis topic contributes to the EU Frontier AI initiative. The project should establish strong links with the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE), ensuring that its priorities inform the research topics addressed. Activities are expected to involve the European AI research community and attract and retain top AI talent working on frontier models and related areas.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform.\nThe project selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories and the Data Labs. Where relevant, it could also establish links with European companies developing frontier AI models.\nAll proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with the European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA) and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\n[1] COM(2025)723 Apply AI Strategy",
