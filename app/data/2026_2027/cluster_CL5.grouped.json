          "expected_outcome": "To support the Zero Pollution Action Plan and the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Real-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;\n- Development of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;\n- Development of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from the data exchanged;\n- Contribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship;\n- Identification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open seas and in-port activities;\n- Innovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities;\n- Recommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world situations;\n- Support of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or deposition of pollutants;\n- Identification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits.",
          "scope": "There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.\nMoreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.\nThe shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework [1] set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action [2] .\nFurther to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SO x emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH 4 , NO x , N 2 O, NH 3 , UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM [3] , as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions.\nLimited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future.\nAssessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N 2 O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted.\nIn addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place.\nWith CH 4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel.\nNew fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH 3) , methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N 2 O and NH 3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH 3 and H 2 , as well as dual-fuel engines and CO 2 capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO 2 is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced.\nDemonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR [4] .\nTo address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&I activities:\n- Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N 2 O, UFP, NH 3 , CH 4,, PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data;\n- Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports;\n- Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated;\n- Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area;\n- Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals;\n- Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates;\n- Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged;\n- Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations;\n- Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels;\n- Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation;\n- Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels;\n- Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, major port cities and coastal areas in the EU.\nProposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on “Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities should be avoided.\nProposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial.\nThe funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects selected under the topic of the EU Ocean & Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and ship source pollution policies.\nThis topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.\n[1] The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040. Measures include the adoption of lower-carbon fuels such as methanol and ammonia. In the EU, initiatives like FuelEU Maritime and ETS inclusion will drive this transition while regulations address harmful emissions like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, with Tier III NOx limits enforced. Discussions also focus on Black Carbon emissions in the Arctic and health impacts of ultrafine particles.\n[2] For example, evidence shows that the introduced Tiers may not be effective in controlling NOx emissions in real vessel operation, scrubbers may result in the formation of new ultra-fine particles, ammonia combustion potentially leads to the formation of nitrous oxide and ammonia slip, methanol combustion may lead to the production of formaldehyde, LNG may result in the slip of methane, etc. Obviously, any strategy targeting the control of GHG or air pollutants should not result in negative side-effects such as the release of harmful pollutants which are today not covered by regulations.\n[3] CH4 – methane; NOx - nitrogen oxides; N20 – nitrous oxide; UFP – ultra-fine particles; BC – black carbon; PM – particulate matter.\n[4] Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable",

          "scope": "The implementation of zero emission vehicles for long-distance heavy-duty freight transport is of key importance to meet the European targets reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. To further accelerate HD-BEV integration in logistic fleets and operations it is essential to identify and address the remaining barriers and challenges of their deployment. These barriers can be related to e.g. limitations in vehicle technology, digital tools, knowledge and user awareness, stakeholder engagement, energy and power availability, charging infrastructure needs such as depot charging and Megawatt Charging System (MCS), permit processes and connection to the grid and services. The challenges for logistics companies’ (also smaller operators) implementing zero emission transport solutions need to be addressed.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Perform large-scale demonstrations of HD BEV equipped with MCS reaching up to a hundred market-ready vehicles and new generation vehicles in logistics fleets operations, involving several transport operators also engaging SMEs and microenterprises, focussing on long-haul operation (average ≥600km operations) during extended durations of over twelve months. The demonstrations must cover at least four European corridors’ segments in at least four Member States (MS) and/or Associated Countries (AC), and involved HD BEV should where possible be also equipped with MCS connector.\n- Identify and address the barriers and challenges to accelerate the deployment of fleets of HD-BEV in long-distance logistics operations in Europe, considering also the impact of battery degradation and the weather conditions in all seasons.\n- Develop and integrate in the demonstrations the use of digital tools with use of AI, access to data sets, operational and governance logistics models including charging opportunities and models to facilitate increasing numbers of HD-BEVs in logistics operations\n- Ensure synergies with the existing publicly accessible charging infrastructure available or funded under the CEF and/or other national/regional funding schemes and assess charging methods and business models for long-haul operations such as depot, destination, truck-stops, overnight etc., using different charging power considering cost and time optimisation. Only depot charging (mono and/or multi-operator) infrastructure can be (partially) funded in demonstration projects, including related innovative business models associated such as smart, bidirectional V2X solutions and possible second life of batteries.\n- Develop a competition-compliant ecosystem for sharing data for HD-BEV fleet management in so-called data labs including data pooling, which can include publication of open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data, and which could build on the common European mobility data space, also supporting the dissemination best practices, learnings and capacity building mechanisms as levers for HD-BEV acceleration. Using the shared data, new services and tools can be developed, including AI-based tools, agents and model frameworks for fleet management, both for on-board and remote monitoring.\n- Define and test use cases for the use of HD-BEV fleets in long-distance logistics operations for cross-border flows, operational strategies to shift freight transport demand to zero-emission solutions, and collaborative business model(s).\n- Establish synergies and leverage with previous and ongoing projects related to HD-BEV and charging systems and with related forums, platforms and programmes, such as with the European Clean Corridors Initiative, as part of the Automotive Action Plan. [1]\n- Map and assess how policies and relevant legislation (including incentives) can support an affordable transition to HD-BEV. Identify and address, by providing recommendations, remaining legal and regulatory barriers encountered in the demonstrations.\nAn analysis of the potential economic, social and environmental benefits (notably greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions reduction) must be included in the demonstrations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

          "scope": "European shipbuilding industry is facing increasing pressure from international players, and there is a need to improve its competitiveness through innovation and technological advancements. The MARI-4YARD project together with RESURGAM, FIBRE4YARDS, SMARTYards and PENELOPE developed several solutions on materials, processes, AI and skills. Additionally, the project SEUS in Horizon Europe is developing an integrated software platform with the ambition to save time in engineering, assembly and construction at European shipyards. However, there is still a need to increase the ambition and demonstrate these solutions in medium and small-size shipyards.\nAt the same time, shipyards are often located in sensitive natural areas, such as coastal regions and estuaries. This provides an opportunity for shipyards to evaluate and reduce their impact on the surrounding biodiversity.\nThe topic aims to improve efficiency and sustainability of European ship newbuilding and retrofitting processes, to improve the use of resources and circularity, to develop necessary skills and improve working conditions. This requires considering all relevant innovations such as robotics, automation, digitalization and AI in the context of shipbuilding to enhance EU/EEA -focused value chains. The purpose is to increase the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding sector with a view to further replicating and utilizing results, including in potential applications to the Innovation Fund.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Deployment and integration of innovative technologies and systems in small and medium-size EU and EEA shipyards to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of newbuild, repair and retrofit processes and process chains.\n- Pilot applications should consider all aspects of the shipbuilding process (including technological, business-related and organizational aspects), equipment, and ship design, potentially including: a) automation and robotics in shipbuilding processes; b) advanced digitalization in design and production; c) innovations in retrofitting and predictive maintenance of shipbuilding assets; circular economy in all relevant processes (construction, repairs, retrofitting and dismantling).\n- Pilot applications should also consider systems interoperability and integration with existing shipyard infrastructure, tools and equipment.\n- Explore advanced ways of digital collaboration (co-simulation, sharing digital data) while considering cyber security, to improve synergies within value chains, including equipment manufacturers, shipyards, ship designers and shipowners.\n- Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies in real life shipyard ecosystem and as much as possible in relation with full scale ship building, including benchmarking of existing practices and consideration of environmental impacts and potential safety improvements for workers. Demonstrations should take place in at least three EU/EEA shipyards.\n- Develop biodiversity friendly strategies, integrating nature-based solutions on site, promoting circularity and sustainability of processes.\n- Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant.\n- Propose measures to solidify the current strengths of smaller and medium-sized shipyards across Europe, with a focus on increasing competitiveness and growth, reinforcing and growing European shipyards and improving environmental performance.\n- For exploitation purposes, proposals should: a) develop business plans and rollout strategies, including measures to reduce knowledge and technology leakage outside of Europe; b) identify clear target groups (vessel types, segments and processes) and their current state, deficiencies and improvement needs, and make a clear exploitation strategy on how to roll out the results to end-users.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

          "scope": "The rapid transition to low and zero-carbon solutions in maritime and inland waterborne transport requires port authorities and stakeholders to swiftly adapt to supply large quantities of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels and electricity. However, this shift poses new safety challenges, particularly in port areas where multiple bunkering operations, import/export terminals, and fuel handling and storage activities coexist. The close location of most ports to cities and inhabited areas raises issues of safety on two fronts: the space deficit due to the difficulty of enlarging the port areas in these locations, (leading to e.g. the storage of various fuels in close proximity), and the broader danger to these inhabited areas due to their proximity to the ports and by extension the storage of these fuels. To ensure a safe and efficient energy transition, it is crucial to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in port areas. As not all ports will be able to store every type of clean fuel in the port or neighbouring area, safety of transport and distribution within the port area (including anchorage) should also be analysed.\nExisting EU legislation regarding specifically the safety of port workers is limited. The Directive on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (2001/96/EC) sets out the EU requirements which increase safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid cargo in EU ports. Further instruments such as the Directive on port State control (2009/16/EC) and the Directive on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector (2009/18/EC, recently amended) , while related to safety in the maritime sector, do not apply to the safety of port workers specifically. Broader instruments such as the EU Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive (89/391/EEC) and the Directive on the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for the Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work (2009/104/EC) , while applicable to port workers due to their general character, miss the intricacies needed to address the specific risks of workers in this sector. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that port workers are being exposed to new risks due to the rising use of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in the maritime sector and the need for safe bunkering and storage of these fuels in port areas.\nGiven the above it is important to have a clear picture of the current status regarding the storage and bunkering of fuels across EU ports, identify existing and applicable legislation, map gaps and potential risks and make appropriate recommendations for follow-up actions.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Conduct a comprehensive review of the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels within (inland and sea) the port areas, including distribution, simultaneous bunkering operations, import/export terminals, handling and storage of fuels.\n- Analyse gaps in existing regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the safe handling and storage of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, in maritime and inland TEN-T ports.\n- Identify safety risks not adequately addressed by current rules and risk assessments, including Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) taking into account - inter-alia - gas dispersion, fire/explosion impacts and their probabilities using F-N curves.\n- Develop guidelines and recommendations to ensure safe operations (considering environmental and health aspects) per fuel type in port areas, considering varying port sizes, services (including technical-nautical vessels), locations, and geographies, especially for ports located in populated areas including establishing safety zones. International rules, standards and guidelines should be taken into consideration (especially from the IMO and the IHPA where relevant). Relevant environmental Plans required by EU or national legislation such as Air Quality Plans should be considered.\n- Develop standard risk assessment criteria for groups of ports with similar characteristics, operational and weather conditions by researching and establishing standard criteria for risk assessments in port planning and development. This includes defining safety-by-design procedures for new port infrastructures and bunkering operations.\n- Engage with relevant stakeholders, including port authorities, terminal operators, shipping companies, trade unions and regulatory bodies, to ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the developed guidelines and recommendations.\n- Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. This strategy should include the design and implementation of comprehensive training modules tailored to various roles within port operations, focusing on the specific safety protocols and procedures associated with renewable low and zero-carbon fuels.\n- Propose certification and continuous professional development pathways to maintain high safety standards and adapt to evolving technologies and regulations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT).

          "scope": "Energy consumption of long-distance shipping should be reduced significantly to achieve sustainable worldwide trade. To achieve a more sustainable and environmentally friendly shipping industry, it is essential to continue developing disruptive technologies, advanced materials, and innovative concepts that can significantly reduce energy consumption of long-distance shipping. The objective of this topic is to support solutions for propulsion and non-propulsion energy consumption that aim to achieve at least at least 25% energy savings in long distance shipping as compared to 2008 levels, through the development and integration of standalone solutions. These technologies include (but are not limited to) active or passive increased performance solutions, novel propulsion systems, augmented propulsion technologies capitalizing also on ship motions, hull performance enhancements and the use of advanced materials which can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of vessels. Any fuel-related proposals should only consider renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. These technologies and concepts should be applicable to various types of ships, including ro-pax, container ships, bulk carriers, and tankers.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Development and demonstration at TRL 4-5 of novel, high-uncertainty but high-reward technologies that significantly reduce energy consumption in long distance shipping.\n- Development of various ship concepts, conducting replication studies for different case scenarios and modelling the real overall energy savings of the solutions and concepts developed.\n- Development of methodologies measuring the impact of the energy efficiency achieved on the GHG intensity and the impact on air pollution of the energy used for propulsion specifically for long distance shipping, with a focus on emission reductions, also facilitating the introduction of such technologies under the scope of LCA guidelines and FuelEU Maritime, and improving the EEDI, EEXI and CII performance where relevant.\n- Consider links with digital twin and AI-based optimisation aspects for the considered technologies (e.g., adaptive and model-predictive control), including the necessary sensing systems, to expand the system’s future capacities.\n- Model the economic viability of the developed technologies, considering initial investment, operational savings, maintenance costs, and potential financial incentives, to assess the economic feasibility while also facilitating decision-making in the design process.\n- Assessment of the safety and environmental implications of the solutions, including technical and operational risks, possible impacts to ships, ports and other land infrastructure.\n- Ensure appropriate sustainability of the action outputs by elaborating on a technology development roadmap and by exploring business cases.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT).

          "scope": "With continuous increase in electrification of the car fleet and railways, the share of non-exhaust particulate emissions into the environment becomes increasingly important. Non-exhaust emissions (NEE) of particles apply to all forms of ground transport and can be categorised as those coming from several sources, such as brake wear, tyre wear, pantograph-catenary wear, wheel-rail contact, road surface wear, as well as vehicle-induced resuspension of road/track dust deposited on the surface. There may be other sources, e.g. engine belts and clutch plates. Quantitative data on the magnitude of non-exhaust emissions are fragmented and highly uncertain, particularly when compared to data for exhaust emissions. Emissions vary widely according to brake, tyre and road surface material, and with driving style. Further research efforts are necessary to increase the understanding of these particles, their creation, ageing and dispersion in the environment.\nMoreover, the health impact of NEEs is far less studied, and it remains unclear whether these predominately solid/non-soluble PM may induce the same effects as combustion PM. Additionally, these pollutants has been reported to adversely affect terrestrial systems and aquatic environment as well as the biodiversity; however, it is not clear to what extent.\nResearch into rail particulate emissions is an equally important area due to its implications for air quality, human health, and environmental impact. However, research data on the health impacts of specific particulate components is limited. Furthermore, comprehensive studies on the chemical composition of rail particulates are scarce. The impact of rail particulates on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity is not well understood, while more data is needed on how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas. Addressing these research gaps would provide a more comprehensive understanding of rail particulate emissions and contribute to the development of effective mitigation strategies.\nIn order to address the two aforementioned areas (road and rail), R&I actions are expected to address the following aspects:\n- Methods and tools for the segregation of NEE particle sources: i) during particle collection (e.g., due to high background concentrations), ii) attribution of collected material to different sources. Appropriate real-world test conditions, equipment and sampling methods for the evaluation of particles (e.g., separation of total and solid particles)\n- Source identification and characterization including detailed source apportionment (brake wear, tyre wear, wheel-rail interaction, resuspension, etc.) and chemical composition;\n- Assessment of the influencing parameters: use cases (e.g. different vehicle types or tyre types), conditions (e.g. urban, rural, motorways, tunnels), driving behaviour, state of the road surface or rail tracks; attribution and distribution;\n- Emission Measurement Techniques including but not limited to standardized measurement methods and real-time monitoring;\n- Downstream assessment: analysis of the deposited material in the environment, assessment of its decomposition, aggregation, dispersion and degradation;\n- Health Impact estimates building on existing toxicology studies (or developing new ones if deemed necessary) and long-term exposure effects supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis;\n- Estimates on the environmental impact on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity as well as deposition patterns (i.e. how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas.)\n- Mitigations through focusing on State-of-the-Art systems: test systems (including the vehicle e.g., vehicle-lightweight technologies) that can mitigate non-exhaust emissions to reach TRL 6 or higher, innovative tyre and brake designs and materials that balance durability, safety, and reduced abrasion, innovative road surfaces and texture (considering the interaction between tyre and road), runoff and drainage systems. For the railway sector mitigation solutions could include test systems addressing emissions from key mechanical interfaces (e.g., braking and wheel–rail contact), vehicle innovations to reduce wear-related emissions, and infrastructure measures such as optimized track materials, surface treatments, and improved drainage and containment systems. Consider life cycle assessment for the analysis of the systems\n- Support standardization and regulation based on the recommendations in support of industrial competitiveness\nProposals should take into consideration the results of previous or on-going EU funded projects such as Leon-T , ULTRAHAS , nPETS and LIFE23-ENV-ES-LIFE NEEVE and any other similar projects.",

          "scope": "Climate monitoring of Essential Climate Variables [1] at global and regional scales is crucial to assess the state of our climate, its variability and change, and to track progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the corresponding EU climate objectives. Underlying elements, in particular climate data records, reanalyses and forcings, are fundamental to climate science and serve multiple applications across weather, climate, environmental and sectoral domains, generating societal benefits. In turn, methods to distil information from this wealth of data can help extract relevant knowledge and key messages for climate policymaking.\nProposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:\nA. Next generation climate data records\nActions should advance innovative methods to enhance, expand and update climate data records; exploit recently rescued and/or new data streams; develop innovative methods to improve the water-energy-carbon cycle physical and bio-geochemical consistency across data records; and improve their applicability for users.\nB. Next generation Earth system reanalyses\nActions should undertake research to prepare for the next generation global and European high resolution climate reanalyses. Progress is expected in enhanced data assimilation methods, further coupling the Earth system components, expanding atmospheric composition reanalysis backward in time, piloting carbon-energy-water cycle reanalyses, exploring data-driven methods for reanalyses and applying such improvements in subsequent applications and international initiatives.\nC. Next generation climate forcing and emission data sets\nActions are expected to conduct research to ensure more updated and sustained production, and quality assurance procedures of climate forcings and emissions data sets in support of international climate change assessments and climate simulations, including harmonization between forcing and emission data sets (historical and scenarios).\nAdditionally, all actions should promote the development and use of new, rescued or proxy data streams, and innovative digital tools and methods, including AI-based, to transform climate data into actionable knowledge. These efforts should align with, build upon, and support global intercomparison and coordination frameworks such as CMIP, promoting standardisation, accessibility and utility of climate information across climate science and service user communities, with due consideration of FAIR principles.\nNoting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale.\nResearch areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public.\nInternational cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP [2] , GCOS [3] , and IAMC [4] is strongly encouraged, as well as close coordination and complementarity with Copernicus, Destination Earth, and other relevant stakeholders.\n[1] GCOS Essential Climate Variables\n[2] https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\n[3] https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos\n[4] https://www.iamconsortium.org/",

          "scope": "The development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States rely on the most accurate and decision-useful assessments of climate risks that science can provide. For this purpose, the new knowledge feeding future EUCRAs will be essential. In the first EUCRA assessment, a number of gaps in terms of knowledge and action, and corresponding recommendations are highlighted to underpin more effective EU policy intervention to manage climate risks, stressing the importance of a systemic approach to climate risk assessments, adaptation and resilience and of the interaction with non-climate risk drivers, such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation among others.\nTo support the future EUCRAs and advance adaptation and climate preparedness, actions should improve the understanding and quantification of climate risks, their underlying drivers, and reduce associated uncertainties for different systems and regions. New knowledge should be integrated to assess the risks of wildcards (high impact low probability or black swan events), crossing of tipping points and transboundary, compound and cascading risks in a way that can facilitate decision-making.\nEvidence from recent experiences of materialised climate risks and the performance of adaptation efforts, encompassing the whole range from failure to success and including the role of behavioural aspects, should be mapped and analysed to improve understanding of the key factors that determine effective environmental and social resilience, preparedness and adaptation capacity [2] . However, developing context-specific adaptation strategies is out of the scope of this topic.\nThe main focus is tackling knowledge gaps identified in the EUCRA. Actions should extend and improve the evidence base by retrieving inputs from relevant end-users, including local and regional authorities, and civil society organisations. While general aspects should cover the whole EU, actions should also improve understanding of sub-European and national to local specific risks. Actions should enhance methodologies and tools for risk assessment, making the outputs available through user-oriented EU portals. For these purposes, proposals should:\n- Address at least two systems or sectors (e.g. ecosystems, agri-food, health, infrastructures, energy, water, economy and finance) that interact and have transboundary effects.\n- Include study cases at sub-European scale. While all the cases together should cover the 4 regions defined in EUCRA [3] , some of the individual cases should also address the transnational dimension (i.e. include more than one country of the particular region).\nActions should contribute to future editions of EUCRA. Specific resources should be devoted to this purpose. Actions should leverage recent advances on other climate risk assessments and related frameworks from reliable sources (e.g. the World Climate Research Programme, WCRP).\nActions are encouraged to integrate multiple data sources and to leverage digital technologies, such as AI/ML techniques, tools, and models, including those developed under the European Commission’s Destination Earth initiative, if appropriate.\nCoordination and collaboration with relevant projects from Mission Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 on Climate Science and Responses is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national to local scale assessment, methodological consistency, and cross-fertilisation through project scientific boards; with projects from Cluster 3 Destination Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe for knowledge exchange and better integration of end-user perspectives, and from relevant Destinations in other Clusters. Actions are encouraged to make use of the European research infrastructures including Integrated Research Infrastructure Services for Climate Change Risks [4] , if appropriate.\n[1] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment\n[2] See for instance the report “ Safer together: A path towards a fully prepared Union - European Commission ”\n[3] Northern, Western, Central-eastern and Southern Europe as considered in the EUCRA report.\n[4] https://www.iriscc.eu/",

Comprehensive assessments of the socio-economic impacts of climate change are essential for this, however, current approaches face significant challenges with a wide uncertainty in global damage estimates, fragmentation, lack of comparability across methodologies, and reliance on extrapolation from historical data, increasingly unrealistic in the context of current unprecedented changes in the climate system.\nActions should develop and enhance models, methods, and tools to improve the understanding of future socio-economic costs of climate inaction (for the purpose of this topic defined as insufficient, or delayed action), advancing novel approaches and frameworks to address the limitations in existing methodologies, integrating latest scientific evidence, diverse data sources and applicable to various conditions and contexts. In this context, actions are encouraged to leverage emerging digital capabilities, including, if appropriate, those developed under initiatives like Destination Earth. Research should account for the full spectrum of climate impacts, such as those from extreme and low-probability high-impact events and the consequences of trespassing Earth system tipping points, to ensure more comprehensive and accurate assessments. Cascading and compound effects as well as non-market impacts (e.g. health, biodiversity and ecosystems, migration) should be considered. Actions should also contribute to rethinking discount rates and damage functions to better reflect the long-term uncertainty of climate impacts and their implications.\nActions should assess foregone co-benefits and missed opportunities of climate inaction, and their distribution, ranging from health-related gains to economic benefits like business and industrial opportunities, job creation, energy and economic security, innovation and lower costs, as well as environmental and social improvements such as from biodiversity conservation, and reduced inequalities. They should assess increased adaptation needs and costs associated with inadequate mitigation, accelerated climate impacts, lost resilience, crossing of adaptation limits as well as the impact on public budgets [1] . To provide the full picture, the cost of climate inaction should be compared with the cost of ambitious mitigation and adaptation.\nActions should emphasise treatment of uncertainty, ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change. They should explore approaches more compatible with planetary boundaries, going beyond traditional welfare and cost-effectiveness models.\nThis topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant SSH disciplines. Actions should include a process of co-design with stakeholders (e.g., representatives of governments, public administrations, such as civil protection competent authorities, or the private sector) to support uptake of the results.\nProposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:\nArea A: Global\nAnalysis should be global in scale, while also providing regionally resolved insights to enable comparisons across world regions, distinguishing between developing and developed, and duly reflecting diverse circumstances and contexts. International cooperation is generally encouraged and specifically required with low and lower/upper-middle-income countries [2] – particularly major GHG emitters [3] such as China (contributing to the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiative [4] ), India, Brazil and Indonesia. It should enable delivery of robust, representative and widely accepted estimates, and support scientific capacity building where appropriate.\nArea B: The EU\nActions should focus on the EU. Particular attention should be given to consequences for EU industrial performance, security of supply and strategic autonomy.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe.\n[1] For example, the proposals could build upon the joint World Bank and European Commission reports on disaster and climate resilience: Economics for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness\n[2] https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lendinggroups ; standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply - only participants from some of these countries are automatically eligible for funding\n[3] https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgtot#emissions_table\n[4] International cooperation with China in research and innovation",

          "scope": "Climate change science is well-established and increasingly relevant to daily life and societal welfare. However, effectively communicating both the science and the necessary climate actions remains a significant challenge. Particularly challenging is understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and misinterpretation. There is also a crucial need for a strengthened public trust in science and in democracy, and for evidence-based climate communication strategies that foster a sense of agency through empowering and positive narratives. Complex messages should be made accessible, relevant, and reliable to non-specialist audiences.\nActions are expected to advance the understanding of the sources, channels, types, and influence of misinformation and disinformation on the public perception and assimilation of climate change-related information. The role of AI should also be investigated. Actions should identify, develop, and test strategies for the public and private sectors to detect, monitor and counteract mis/disinformation about climate and climate policy. Such tools and products should be made available for policymakers, companies and the general public to incentivise and equip society to critically assess climate change-related information online and offline.\nResearch is expected to explore how to bridge the gap from climate knowledge and awareness to behavioural change, taking into consideration various factors that shape perceptions across different segments of the society. Actions should generate knowledge and develop innovative, engaging, tailored and multilingual tools, learning techniques, and narratives for impactful climate change communication frameworks at scale. Best-practice examples on European and international level should be retrieved. Climate scientists should be trained to effectively communicate with non-specialist audiences, including policymakers and other stakeholders. Research should investigate how to design and implement targeted communication campaigns that boost climate awareness and preparedness while preventing climate anxiety and counteract disinformation. These campaigns should promote fact-checking, clear and transparent knowledge on climate science and climate policymaking and foster the ability to interpret uncertainties. Citizen engagement, of youth and other vulnerable audiences in particular, is encouraged.\nActions should develop communication strategies, tools and products tailored to real-world context and societal needs, to counter disinformation and enhance climate communication, leveraging visual and digital tools including AI, as appropriate. They should demonstrate clear pathways for uptake and scaling such as piloting with end-users and integration into existing platforms or frameworks.\nThe primary focus of actions should be on Europe, with local and national foci as appropriate, while other regions may be used for framing information. International cooperation is encouraged, especially with the United States [1] and low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding [2] .\nThis research requires a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach drawing on insights from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (SSH) including behavioural sciences and gender, media studies, and communication theory. Participation of the private sector, in particular SME, is also strongly encouraged.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe. Collaboration with the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Climate neutral and Smart Cities is recommended when performing empirical work. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes.\n[1] Standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply – legal entities from the USA are not automatically eligible for funding.\n[2] Please refer to Horizon Europe List of Participating Countries on EU Funding and Tenders Portal for up-to-date information.",

While significant advancements in global weather and climate science have transformed resilience efforts elsewhere, their benefits in Africa remain to be harnessed, to unlock the continent’s ability to address climate challenges more effectively.\nActions should address critical knowledge gaps for improving weather and climate modelling for Africa in the context of changing climate, with focus on the understanding and representation of weather and climate dynamics in Africa at regional, interregional or continental scale. They should enhance models’ predictive skill and reduce uncertainties in key areas such as rainfall and extreme weather events. Actions should harness observational data to advance process-based understanding and model performance across various Earth System components (e.g. land, ocean, atmosphere). This includes improving data collection, assimilation and quality assurance practices, integration of local and rescued historical data to provide high-quality inputs for models. Actions are encouraged to leverage digital technologies, including AI/ML techniques, tools, and models as well as advances in high performance computing to achieve the topic’s goals.\nThe research should be performed in close cooperation and co-creation between African and European teams in a way to ensure relevance, acceptance and co-ownership of solutions by African stakeholders. Actions are also expected to contribute to local capacity-building and knowledge exchange to support competence growth and equip African researchers with the data, tools and expertise necessary to sustain future progress. Strong partnerships should be established between relevant institutions in both regions such as universities, research bodies, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and African Regional Climate Centers (RCCs) [3] to enable mutual learning and collaborations.\nSynergies and complementarity should be sought with other relevant EU-supported initiatives on climate modelling and capacity development in Africa such as Regional Centres of Excellence related to the green transition [4] .

          "scope": "The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;\n- Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures [1] ;\n- Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;\n- Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;\n- Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;\n- Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD).\nSolutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04 [2] and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.\nAs the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01 [3] and other directly relevant call topics.\nIn view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad [4] and Diversify – CCAM [5] .\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [6] .\n[1] In line with the European Artificial Intelligence strategy and requirements for trustworthy, explainable, and safe AI.\n[2] AI for advanced and collective perception and decision making for CCAM applications\n[3] Centralised, reliable, cyber-secure & upgradable in-vehicle electronic control architectures for CCAM connected to the cloud-edge continuum.\n[4] Cocreate, Embrace – grant agreement ID: 101147397 .\n[5] Diversify CCAM by integrating European cultural and regional variations in the design and implementation of citizen-friendly systems to foster mobility equity - grant agreement id: 101147484 .\n[6] See the evaluation methodology here .",

CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.\nThis will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving [1] and BERTHA [2] for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.\nTo achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.\nProposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART [3] and SUNRISE [4] and complemented by the project SYNERGIES [5] . Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 [6] . Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06 [7] .\nProposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for the parametrisation and validation of behavioural models, while considering regional and cultural differences as well as specificities of respective road infrastructures.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [8] .\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.\n[1] Integrated 4D driver modelling under uncertainty, grant agreement ID: 101076165 .\n[2] BEhavioural ReplicaTion of Human drivers for CCAM, grant agreement ID: 101076360 .\n[3] Harmonised European solutions for testing automated road transport, grant agreement id: 824309 .\n[4] Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: 101069573 .\n[5] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542 .\n[6] Generation of scenarios for development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems\n[7] Federated CCAM data exchange platform (see below).\n[8] See the evaluation methodology here .",

          "scope": "CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.\nTo encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.\nEdge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus , it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM [1] and AIthena [2] .\n- Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES [3] . The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects;\n- Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently;\n- Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change.\nThe research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

          "scope": "Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space [1] aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).\nSeveral data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME [2] project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE [3] and SYNERGIES [4] . However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre [5] . In parallel, the DeployEMDS [6] builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.\nConsequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena [7] and AWARE2ALL [8] have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks.\nBy establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society.\nProposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps;\n- Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space;\n- Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles;\n- Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators;\n- Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform;\n- Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures.\nA strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects [9] is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl [10] . The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space ( Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving ). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium ( EDIC ) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [11] .\n[1] Creating a common European mobility data space - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] Framework for coordination of Automated Mobility in Europe, grant agreement ID: 101069898 .\n[3] Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: 101069573 .\n[4] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542 .\n[5] Data Spaces Blueprint\n[6] See for more information: https://deployemds.eu/\n[7] AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: 101076754 .\n[8] Safety systems and human-machine interfaces oriented to diverse population towards future scenarios with increasing share of highly automated vehicles, grant agreement ID: 101076868 .\n[9] The awarded proposal should build on the outcomes of the preparatory action PrepDSpace4Mobility and the EMDS study under CEF.

          "scope": "The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 [1] . To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.\nThe EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy [2] (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.\nResearch in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.\nProposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;\n- Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;\n- Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;\n- Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;\n- Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);\n- Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;\n- Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;\n- Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS [3] ), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.\nThe projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment [4] (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks [5] , in particular cascading impacts across sectors.\nProposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards, [6] and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.

          "scope": "Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.\nTherefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.\nThe proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.\nProposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS) .\nOutside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.\nBuilding on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;\n- Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.\n- Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.\n- Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.\n- Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation;\n- Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics;\n- Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU [2] , the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [3] , and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain;\n- Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR [4] , digital identities [5] , data spaces [6] , AI act [7] , Data Governance Act [8] , Cybersecurity Act [9] ; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance.\n- Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices.\n- Identify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj .\n[2] Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52023PC0441\n[3] Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022L2464\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj\n[6] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces\n[7] Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n[8] Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0868\n[9] Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019R0881",

          "scope": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.\nAccurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:\n- Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime) [1] , Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) [2] , Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV) [6] and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU) [3] , and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);\n- Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER) [8] ;\n- Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards [9] ;\n- Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport [10] ;\n- Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector.\nBuilding on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:\n- The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;\n- Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;\n- Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;\n- New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;\n- Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information [11] .\nThe Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services.\nThe proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format; GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded; GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations.\n- Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular: a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations; allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft.\n- Based on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU);\n- Building on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive) [12] must be ensured;\n- Define R&I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions measuring framework.\nThe project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\nMechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[2] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[3] COM(2023) 441 final\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[6] Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[7] COM(2023) 441 final\n[8] https://emissionfactors.eu/\n[9] This standard has also been formally adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) under the reference CEN ISO 14083\n[10] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9781f65f-8448-11ea-bf12-01aa75ed71a1\n[11] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information\n[12] Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources, and repealing Council Directive (EU) 2015/652",

          "scope": "While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy [3] .\nProposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;\n- Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive [4] and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;\n- Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle;\n- Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC);\n- Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT;\n- Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains.\n[1] COM(2021) 324 final eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download\n[3] Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future, COM/2020/789 final\n[4] Directive (EU) 2023/2661",

          "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- Improved (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) road safety (actual and perceived) for pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility devices, considering that the safety of these users is not only at risk from motorised vehicles, but also from their interaction with road users with higher masses or operating speeds (e.g. between e-bikes and pedestrians);\n- An in-depth analysis and assessment of the safety associated with the emergence of electrically assisted small vehicles such e-bikes, e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, to be referred to as micromobility modes, that may be shared or own, and are used for personal mobility (e.g. commuting) and the transportation of goods (e.g. parcel delivery);\n- Increased (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) use of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups as a result of improved safety;\n- Standardisation guidelines for the authorities (cities authorities, police, and hospitals) on how to report crashes that involve micromobility modes with the objective to avoid under- and/or misreporting;\n- Guidelines for the city authorities on how to incorporate micromobility modes in their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and account for the safety and convenience of all road users;\n- Development of mitigating solutions for the adverse impact on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of the changing car fleet towards bigger and heavier vehicles;\n- In depth analysis of the impact of road infrastructure (e.g. design, markings, degradation status, quality, network connectivity) on the safety and comfort of cyclists, pedestrians, and micromobility users and development of mitigation solutions;\n- Assessment methodologies to evaluate the safety potential and the effectiveness of advanced safety measures.",
          "scope": "The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.\nProposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:\n- Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;\n- Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;\n- Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;\n- Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;\n- Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;\n- Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards;\n- Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments: new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices; smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic; road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project; development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.\nSpecial focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc).\nProposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning.\nProposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions [1] and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and behavioural norms.\n[1] E.g. https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/861570 and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430 projects",

          "scope": "One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.\nIn terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON [1] could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);\n- Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;\n- Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;\n- Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;\n- Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;\n- Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;\n- Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;\n- Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services.\nParticular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.\nWays to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.\nResearch is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.\n[1] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955269",

There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.\nTo enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):\n1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:\n- Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;\n- Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;\n- Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);\n- Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability.\n2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments [1] .\n3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:\n- Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;\n- High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);\n- Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);\n- Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.\nThis research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency:\n- RES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection\n- RES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD)\n- RES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis\n- RMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements\n- RMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance degradation\nA close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned.\n[1] Note: the project will assess the use of specific models for the prediction of icing conditions (e.g., addressing cloud micro-physics for the formation ice crystals, super cooled water droplets), which can be coupled to climate models (e.g., General Circulation Models).",

Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\n- Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;\n- Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\n- Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;\n- National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime.\n- Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns;\n- The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated.",

The exploitation plan should include plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants.\nAn assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production.

          "expected_outcome": "The EU’s Offshore Strategy [1] underlines that the deployment of offshore wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023) [2] .\nOur knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted [3] . However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.\nImproving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR [4] in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;\n- The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;\n- Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;\n- Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones.",
          "scope": "Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:\n- Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;\n- Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;\n- Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;\n- Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;\n- Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;\n- Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;\n- Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project.\nParticular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures.\nComplementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core infrastructure , for instance the projects funded under topics:\n- HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06: Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection;\n- HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean;\n- HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms.\nIn addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics.\nEnvironmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy.\n[1] COM(2020) 741 final\n[2] COM (2023) 668 final - EUR-Lex - 52023DC0668 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)\n[3] See for instance the ETC/ICM Report 2/2022: Mapping potential environmental impacts of offshore renewable energy, at: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy\n[4] https://www.ospar.org/",

          "expected_outcome": "The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda [1] .",
          "scope": "Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;\n- Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;\n- Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;\n- Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;\n- Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.\n- Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process.\nProposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;\n- Increased module durability and reliability;\n- Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;\n- Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);\n- Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda [1] .",
          "scope": "The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:\n- Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;\n- Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;\n- Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;\n- Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime.\nDifferent locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

          "scope": "The challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.\nThe operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.\nThe EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects.\nProposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.\nActivities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.\nThe proposed action is to be structured as following:\nPreparation phase :\nParticipating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8).\nThe procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to be necessarily tested at the same site.\nAt the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation of the lead procurer.\nExecution phase :\nThis phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts.\nThe procurement will be executed as a single joint procedure in which different lots can be considered. The research and specification works are expected to lead to at least two commercial scale demonstrators tested for at least 12 months in a commercially representative site during the action duration following the IEA-OES [1] stage-gate metrics.\nResults will be shared with the European industry to accelerate the technology development and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of knowledge creation. At the end of the action, at least one of the demonstrators is expected to be ready for testing in an operational environment at commercial scale.\nAt the end of the action, designs are expected to be ready to proceed to Stage 5 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas (Commercial-scale array demonstration).\n[1] IEA-OES: International Energy Agency – Ocean Energy Systems",

Technical and social characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions' credibility. The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems.\nIn order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities.\nThe selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively participate in its activities.

Demonstrate how the test site has been identified, and that CO2 storage is legally possible in the designated area.\n- Test sites must be in a saline aquifer at a minimal depth of 800 m, in a geologically stable area, with minimal faulting and fracturing, that provide significant scalable storage capacity (proven confinement, limited heterogeneity, and with favourable porosity and permeability and porosity), and are expected to gain the necessary permits, following the appraisal and testing. The geological conditions of the site should be defined in term of risks as it is in the Directive, that is, proposed site must demonstrate, in line with existing data, that prior analysis shows that, under the proposed conditions of use, there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.\n- Tests should be designed as to allow a reliable quantification of the injectivity index. Test duration should be optimised to achieve a representative pressure transient response.\n- The Horizon Europe grant can support all data acquisition, processing and interpretation, modelling, the drilling, completion and logging of the test well, the injectivity test, and the measuring & monitoring technologies. These operations can be carried out by the consortium or be subcontracted.\nThis topic contributes to the R&I activity in the SET-Plan CCUS Implementation Plan [1] to unlock CO2 storage capacity through support to pre-commercial appraisal activities.\n[1] 06700519-1f0f-49b7-bd03-b9021e08fc1b_en",

An area of particular interest in this domain are large-scale testing facilities for offshore floating wind energy systems.\n- Wind energy systems interactions with climate, atmosphere, ocean and geophysics: geophysical characteristics measuring and modelling, wake effect model development, climate change impact analysis\n- Environmental and social aspects, coexistence: evolution of environmental impact assessments, spatial planning, biodiversity solutions, reduced pollution (e.g. noise and vibration, pollution due to erosion of the blades), design and implementation of practices and platforms that facilitate inclusive communication and stakeholders’ involvement, tools to map stakeholder concerns and development of practical approaches to lifecycle public participation, socialisation of wind rights, relationship between people, technology and places for all relevant social issues\n- Emerging technologies: new concept assessment and development (e.g. multirotor concepts, tip rotor designs, ducted turbines), improved performance and efficiency of emerging/innovative wind energy systems\nStructure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation\nThe action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities implemented through financial support to third parties. The R&I activities are divided into three challenges:\n- Breakthrough challenge\n- Validation challenge\n- Demonstration challenge\nThe breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities.\nThe breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new and potentially disruptive solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the wind energy sector and on the acceleration of wind energy deployment at scale both off- and onshore, including with experimental proof of concept, as well as with validation both in laboratory and relevant environment, as appropriate. Concepts and technologies initially developed through the breakthrough challenge could be further matured through the validation challenge.\nThe validation challenge entails actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions, both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment that have been developed in the project but also developed previously and separately in other European and national projects. For the validation, the project can consider different use cases (e.g. onshore, offshore).\nThe demonstration challenge entails demonstration activities to accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry, in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan (activities up to TRL 7-8). It will solely be implemented by the core consortium.\nThe total maximum amount of EU funding for the demonstration activities is expected to be 50 million Euros.\nThe project is expected to implement at least 3 demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The proposed solutions should be demonstrated for a continuous period of at least 6 months.\nThe project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone, for each demonstration activity, before entering the deployment phase. Before each go/no-go milestone, the project is expected to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans, compliant with the applicable standards and iii) a complete business and implementation plan. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project proposal is also expected to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this, the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.\nPrivileged research and innovation areas for the demonstration challenge are the ones listed from a. to f. in the scope: a. industrialisation, scale-up and competitiveness, b. optimisation and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance, c. wind energy system integration, d. sustainability and circularity, e. floating offshore wind and f. research and technology infrastructures for wind energy.\nActivities directly implemented by the core consortium\nThe activities of the core consortium are expected to include the implementation of direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects). It is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.\nActivities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)\nA share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to support research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.\nThe use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, attracting different stakeholders and innovators to develop and validate new technological solutions in the wind sector and respond quickly to new challenges. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&I work can continue without major interruption.\nThe demonstration challenge is excluded from FSTP calls.\nFor the FSTP calls, the following should be taken into account:\n- Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of the long-term R&I challenges. Up to 8 million EUR of the EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The FSTP breakthrough challenge should aim at attracting innovative entities that does not necessarily have the capacity to apply directly for EU grants.\n- Validation challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 16 million EUR of the EU requested contribution is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.\nThe first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP calls for the validation challenge must be published in a later stage considering the experience and the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core project R&I activities. The duration of the actions supported by FSTP should not be longer than 18 months.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nFor the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [3] .\nGovernance of the project\nThe project will have to set out how and with what frequency the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.\nThe core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.\nThe project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in wind energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Wind Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership related initiative and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advises the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET Plan activities and goals. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.\nThe proposal should define mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), benchmarking and progress monitoring). Besides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the wind energy sector [4] . The project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.\nThe consortium will have to present a clear risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.\nIn the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges and actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). A given action supported by such FSTP scheme can be implemented by one third party or a by consortium of entities.\nAs regards data management, in addition to fulfilling the standard research data management and open access requirements in line with the Grant Agreement provisions, the project is expected to set up a platform, possibly re-using an already existing one, to ensure the accessibility and maintenance of the data generated by the project. The platform should be able to organise and host data generated by other research and innovation projects on wind energy. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable)\nThe consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D community.\nCooperation with International Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) on wind energy systems\nFor activities carried out that are also covered by relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Cooperation Programme for wind energy systems [5] , proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.\nDuration\nThe estimated project duration is around 5 years.\n[1] See for instance: ETIP Wind Strategic Research & Innovation Agenda 2025-2027 - November 2023\n[2] See for instance: NeWindEERA – A New Research Programme for the European Wind Energy Sector – September 2024\n[3] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[4] ETIP Wind, EERA JP Wind and IWG Wind (2025); “From innovation to industrial competitiveness – How wind R&I funding will deliver European technology sovereignty”.

          "scope": "This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.\nTo overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.\nProposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).\nProposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:\n- Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;\n- Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;\n- Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;\n- Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;\n- Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life.\nActivities covering the following aspects are encouraged:\n- Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;\n- Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.\n- Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation.

All involved project constituencies and relevant parts of society are accounted for in an integrated way to ensure broad and sustainable support for R&I solutions;\n- The next generation of Societal Readiness projects benefits from current pilot projects’ experiences, success stories and do’s and don’ts thanks to a public web platform, acting as a one-stop-shop for Societal Readiness for future EU projects;\n- The European Commission is equipped with a sound, clear, and replicable procedure – both at implementation and content level – presented as an improvement of the current approach, to address Societal Readiness effectively in future EU funded R&I projects.",
          "scope": "The European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 2025 [3] , and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.\nThe instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.\nThe action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.\nThe project selected should address all of the following actions:\n- Make a consolidated analysis: on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions [4] of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation. of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions ’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium. of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities.\nMid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.\n- Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.\n- Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.\n- Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should be updated and completed on a regular basis.\n- Eventually provide a set of recommendations to the European Commission taking stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-projects in their Final reports on Societal Readiness. Practical improvements of the current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision [5] should be kept in mind when providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.\nAn analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) applied to R&I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed. Successful practices identified may complement recommendations to be provided to the Commission.\nInformation on e.g. on perceptions, feelings, concerns, past experiences on ways of working that is not translated into projects’ documents should be collected via direct interactions (bilateral discussions with respective project partners).\nThe action should also initiate similar monitoring activities on Societal Readiness pilot projects funded under future Horizon Europe work programmes, whenever operational phases of this action and new pilot projects overlap.\nA duration of 42 months is recommended for this action.\nThe proposed action requires the effective contribution of relevant SSH disciplines including the involvement of SSH experts to proficiently support the monitoring and evaluation of Societal Readiness pilot-projects in Cluster 5 work programme 2025.\n[1] Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics\n[2] Social Sciences and Humanities\n[3] HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-06; HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-04; HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-11; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-12\n[4] A declaration of confidentiality will be signed by the CSA\n[5] Societal Readiness is an indication of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for different societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing its potential for societal uptake and transition towards societal adaptation.

Recovery of graphite or silicon/graphite in various compositions should also be addressed. Adequate benchmarking figures must be provided to show progress beyond the state of the art.\nProjects are also expected to demonstrate effective use of technologies for logistics, sorting, collection and discharging of end-of-life batteries. This should involve the informal sector (i.e. end users, collection points, sales channels) and include the following two areas:\n- Development of innovative and digitalised waste collection systems towards zero-risk to improve quantity, quality, safety of the stored End of Life batteries\n- Safe, fast, cost-efficient ways for large-scale discharging/deactivation End of Life batteries (both damaged and scraps), anticipating the development for new chemistries.\nProjects are furthermore expected to assess the environmental impact of the piloted innovations in the recycling processes through Life Cycle Analysis.\nProjects to be aligned with the missions, policies and priorities in the area of battery recycling, in both the regions (India and the EU). On the Indian side, alignment with relevant regulatory and strategic frameworks is expected, such as the Battery Waste Management Rules (2022) and the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage. EU projects are expected to build upon the activities of past and ongoing recycling-related projects under the BATT4EU partnership, as well as progress being made on the implementation of the Battery Passport.

Aligned projects should have the same start date, the same duration, same targets, and must show clearly how the coordination among them will bring added scientific value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects a genuine EU-Indian cooperation, aligned projects should involve properly coordinated research activities between EU and India in the jointly developed research plan of the two coordinated projects. Independent projects, which are not aligned, will be considered ineligible. Proposals will include detailed explanations about tasks and effort of the coordinated proposal as a whole and cross-references to the other part of the proposal.\nThe coordinated call aims at exploiting synergies between India and Europe in terms of scientific expertise and resources in topics related to battery recycling by implementing coordinated projects. Potential areas for collaboration (i.e. the coordinated part of the call) could include (but are not limited to) demonstration of more flexible and adaptable recycling processes capable of treating mixed battery chemistries; innovative & digitalised waste collection systems; advanced sorting systems; active monitoring systems for high level of safety; safe, fast and cost-efficient discharging/deactivation (gen4 included); prediction for second-life use of batteries, diagnostics including State of Health.\nThe topic is within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in relation to battery recycling technologies. For the purposes of this topic, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI), Government of India has made the required funding available for the coordinated projects of the Indian side.

          "scope": "The growing energy needs of the ICT sector must be met while aligning with climate neutrality and sustainability goals. Small IT rooms or small data centres are an essential part of the twin green and digital transition. It is important to address the energy and resources consumption over the full ICT value chain. Solutions already exist, such as re-using waste heat from data centres, or moving towards circular models (longer lifetimes, reparability, reuse and recyclability). Most recent analysis suggests that the energy consumption of consumer devices in 2020 accounted for roughly 50% of the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies, with the two next largest contributors being respectively the production of ICT devices (~20%) and the operation of data centres (~15%) [1] . Moreover, this is expected to change dramatically by 2030, as the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies is expected to increase by 50% over this decade. The Commission has set the strategic goal of ensuring that data centres are climate-neutral, energy- and resource efficient by 2030. However, most efforts are directed towards data centres in scope of the Energy Efficiency Directive recast.\nProposals should address all of the following:\n- Demonstrate state-of-the-art holistic and cost-effective approaches to thermal management and excess heat recovery (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade of heat) and re-use in local or nearby site creating effective added value in existing IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres (in the range of 100-500kW, not covered by Energy Efficiency Directive recast), taking into account thermal envelope/building (by means of simulation or digital twins, among others), integration with building automation and control systems and potential to improve the self-assessment and self-optimisation functionalities at all levels, and integration into existing BMS allowing for further development of energy services. Demonstrators should be located in both cold and warm climate Member State or Associated Country to tackle climate specific challenges of thermal management of waste heat.\n- Develop business cases for state-of-the-art solutions for excess heat recovery & re-use (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade), for example by re-using excess heat in an existing system in the building (such as heating or water production purposes), or in a local district heating and cooling network, or in any other local or nearby site creating effective added value to the recovered heat.\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 4 HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-09: Energy efficiency and sustainability of AI data processing in Data Centres (IA) demonstration pilots.\n[1] eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022SC0341",

          "scope": "CCAM solutions are expected to provide a more user-centred, inclusive mobility system that enhances safety, reduces congestion, lowers harmful emissions, and contributes to decarbonization. In addition, CCAM solutions enhance transport effectiveness, thereby strengthening Europe's competitiveness in the global mobility sector. Novel mobility services can enable seamless integration with existing services such as public transport and logistics, while higher levels of automation are expected to boost transport productivity and efficiency. However, the benefits of these solutions must be proven through large-scale demonstrations, validating their effectiveness for both people and goods. It is also of key importance to integrate and test enabling vehicle technologies and to validate trusted communication and cyber security, as well as real time information transmission. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of technology maturity is necessary, evaluating the readiness of automated driving functions within mixed traffic conditions and in confined areas. This evaluation helps determine the readiness of automation technologies for deployment, considering factors such as operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and user acceptance. By fostering a systematic approach to large-scale demonstrations, technology validation, and maturity assessment, and by prioritising zero-emission mobility, these efforts contribute to the seamless integration of CCAM solutions across the entire public and private transport ecosystem.\nThe proposed action is expected to demonstrate different CCAM solutions and technologies in all the following domains:\n- Individual mobility within mixed traffic environments, encompassing urban, suburban, motorway, and rural settings, with a focus on the seamless integration of automated and conventional vehicles. Use cases should consider diverse road conditions, infrastructure variability, traffic dynamics, and user needs, ensuring safe, efficient, accessible and user-centric mobility solutions. A key aspect is the integration of advanced technologies (e.g. AI, V2X, cybersecurity, precise positioning, etc.) and the validation of technological enablers ensuring that automation solutions are robust, scalable, and adaptable to all CCAM use cases for people and goods.\n- Shared mobility and public transport operations in urban, regional and rural areas, for end-to-end journeys aiming to enhance safety, accessibility, equity, and sustainability, including improving business cases for mobility providers. Validate realistic door-to-door mobility services including links to mobility hubs, ridesharing and parking areas to enhance end-to-end journeys in urban areas and regions.\n- Freight transport for hub-to-hub, corridors, and logistics hubs on public roads and confined areas, integrating logistics, fleet and terminal operators. Validate realistic end-to-end use cases, such as logistics hubs at airports, ports, cross-border, and transhipment terminals, connecting use-cases in confined operations with TEN-T freight corridors.\nWhere relevant, intersecting social factors, such as gender, age, social origin and income level should be considered. All new vehicles acquired for the project's activities, as well as all vehicles participating in final demonstrations conducted in public spaces, are expected to be environmentally friendly, with a special focus on electric vehicles, to maximise synergies and ensure the future integration of solutions into the sustainable mobility mass market.\nThe proposed action should integrate all the following common activities across domains:\n- Ensuring close coordination and synergies with innovation actions planned under the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance, (ECAVA), in particular the Autonomous driving technology roadmap, announced by the European Automotive Action Plan.\n- Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action, HORIZON-CL5-2025-01-D6-02: Preparing for large-scale CCAM demonstrations. [3]\n- Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05 Robust Knowledge and Know-How transfer for Key-Deployment Pathways and implementation of the EU-CEM.

          "scope": "CCAM is a key area of global competition and one of the five pillars of the European Automotive Action Plan for the automotive sector, aimed at helping the industry regain its leadership in the shift towards smarter (AI-powered), cleaner, and more connected vehicles, However, CCAM deployment is shaped by evolving geopolitical dynamics, rapid technological advancements, and economic uncertainties. Europe must secure its leadership in CCAM and strengthen its socioeconomic resilience by continuously addressing vulnerabilities and identifying robust pathways for policy development and market deployment. This topic will assess the global geopolitical landscape of CCAM innovation, map future pathways, and develop evidence-based strategies for policymakers, businesses, and investors. The results will support robust, future-proof policies, business strategies, and investment frameworks, ensuring a resilient, inclusive, and competitive European CCAM ecosystem.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Conduct a comprehensive geopolitical and economic analysis of CCAM to map Europe’s strategic position in global competition. Identify vulnerabilities, dependencies and opportunities in business models, supply chains, critical raw materials, technological capabilities, digital and physical infrastructure, validation processes, safety benchmarks, and pricing strategies, supported by AI-driven analytics and innovation mapping tools. The analysis should also assess large-scale CCAM initiatives worldwide, identifying scaling trajectories, tipping points, commercialization barriers, and success factors. These insights should inform strategic policymaking, investment decisions, and Europe’s regulatory positioning in global CCAM markets.\n- Develop novel, stakeholder-driven participatory future scenarios to explore plausible geopolitical, technological, and economic developments affecting CCAM, and define associated transition pathways toward desirable European futures that ensure resilience, strategic autonomy, and competitiveness. Use advanced foresight methods (e.g. qualitative scenarios, horizon scanning, technology roadmapping, etc.), complemented by iterative validation through a minimum of three dedicated Living Labs, to understand trade-offs, assess risks, and define strategic priorities under different global conditions. The project should also identify KPIs that capture European added value, unique selling points, and global market positioning, and apply these to assess and guide CCAM competitiveness The project should also identify KPIs that measure the European added value, its unique selling points and global market positioning, to apply these KPIs to define CCAM competitiveness.\n- Assess the socioeconomic impacts of different CCAM deployment pathways, focusing on economic, employment, and social equity dimensions. Analyse income growth, employment effects, regional economic convergence, and productivity gains using integrated economic-transport modelling approaches that account for dynamic interactions and systemic feedback across Member States and Associated Countries, economic sectors, and demographic groups. Identify potential disparities and propose policy recommendations and investment strategies to ensure that CCAM contributes to inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic growth across all regions of Europe.

          "scope": "Pilots and demonstrations using Level 3 and 4 vehicle services face major challenges in perception and decision making, highlighting the necessity for low-latency solutions that enhance responsiveness and situational awareness in real-time operating conditions. This is especially relevant for driving in more complex environments like urban areas, where environmental variance is higher and where new scenarios can be regularly encountered. Furthermore, there is the need to limit the latency, bandwidth and energy use for on-board calculations, as well as the need to enhance the security, privacy and reliability (e.g. scene understanding and prediction of near-future scenario development). For rapid decision-making in interactions with VRUs, this is essential for implementing CCAM-enabled solutions and ensuring scalability.\nAt the same time, developments of sector-agnostic technologies show advancements -such as GenAI- that can be beneficial for CCAM. First exploratory steps can be expected from a project funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 [1] regarding the potential in the virtual generation of edge cases, which could be used for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems.\nFurther advancements in GenAI applications specifically for the CCAM domain need to be developed, trained and validated [2] . Thus, proposed actions shall include approaches to exploit further technological advancements for CCAM. Major steps are needed to advance to highly advanced, ultra-safe, trustworthy and energy efficient real-time perception and decision-making systems for automated vehicles, specifically focusing on scalable solutions and the exploitation of GenAI. These advancements should leverage low latency systems or distributed computing resources to facilitate real-time processing, thereby improving system responsiveness and safety. This topic will thus contribute to the AI Continent Action Plan [3] by fostering AI development and adoption in the automotive sector.\nProposed actions are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Development of tools and approaches for robust environment perception and decision making (at the edge, on-board, at infrastructure or back-office). These approaches shall aim at accelerating and advancing the reasoning of decision making, increasing the level of efficiency, (cyber)-security and reliability of the applications, with path planning as initial use case. This is to support amongst others the perception of VRUs, the prediction of their behaviour and their intentions, and includes data sharing approaches for CCAM solutions to create a larger time window for actions in near accident scenarios. The use of advanced GenAI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) or Vision Language Action (VLAs) can significantly enhance these capabilities by leveraging their advanced contextual reasoning and pattern recognition. Furthermore, GenAI can complement existing perception systems by improving sensory input interpretation and providing enriched environmental contexts, which enhance decision-making and adaptability.\n- Scenario generation of interactions of CCAM enabled vehicles with other road users, which is essential for advances in validation and testing, extending existing datasets and scenarios as GenAI can, based on existing data, deliver variations of scenarios (e.g. cultural differences of road users and infrastructure variability.)\n- Integration of GenAI technologies into existing approaches (development, training and validation) for their further enrichment. Understanding the limits of using GenAI technologies as well as the benefits and develop guidelines for valid approaches for this integration (including consideration of gender biases and fairness to ensure AI systems are transparent and accountable) and providing an outlook on the uptake of the tools and approaches developed can be done for a variety of CCAM components and technologies, as well as for systemic applications such as traffic management and remote control.\n- Encouraging collaboration with the European Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative by adopting existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework.\nProposed actions should include measures to ensure close coordination with the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European Automotive Action Plan.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

          "scope": "Freight transport demand in Europe is expected to double in the coming decades, making it essential to enhance the capacity, efficiency, and resilience of freight transport to maintain the European competitiveness. Despite policy goals to strengthen multimodal transport, double rail freight’s share by 2050, and increase transport by inland waterways and short sea shipping by 50% by 2050, unimodal road transport remains more competitive, and the growth of multimodal freight has been limited.\nThe lack of integration of rail, inland waterways and multimodal data into logistics and supply chain solutions is one of the main barriers, hindering the efficient and competitive adoption of multimodality. Furthermore, improving system resilience requires better tools and solutions for multimodal operators to manage disruptions and ensure supply chain continuity.\nBuilding on the results of previously funded research projects and initiatives (including e.g. the Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking), proposals should address all of the following aspects:\n- Building on data governance models set in the European Data Act, Common European Data Spaces and the electronic Freight Transport Information Regulation, develop interoperable tools and solutions integrated in existing platforms and solutions (also leveraging the full potential of e.g. Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and other emerging technologies) used by shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, warehouse operators, distribution centres, retailers and e-commerce platforms to connect with multimodal information (e.g. services, visibility, ETA, etc.). Developing any type of digital platform or similar is outside the scope of this topic. The proposed tools and solutions should also help operators to react rapidly to disruptions, considering strategies and alternatives for cases of failure, accidents, sabotage, force majeure, etc.\n- Map and identify datasets available or to be developed to enhance the integration of multimodal solutions in other supply chain processes (e.g. rail timetable information). Assess how new technologies (e.g. generative Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things) could be leveraged and applied, including, but not limited to, the procurement and management of smart containers (e.g. for real-time monitoring of cargo conditions, ETA). Explore synchromodality strategies for logistics hubs and multimodal transport networks.\n- Based on the business and technical requirements (e.g. transport management systems, data structures, data security) of both freight forwarders and shippers, develop interoperable solutions and tools to support freight forwarders and multimodal operators to address shippers’ demands in terms of information provision and sharing, including as regards logistic hubs and first / last mile connections.\n- Define use cases for multimodal transport for intra-European flows between 500 and 1,000 km (from first to last mile delivery), and collaborative business model(s) to shift freight transport demand to multimodal solutions.\n- Validate, measure the performance and demonstrate the proposed solutions and concepts in 2 large pilots along segments of the main European freight transport corridors, ensuring geographical balance and covering various types of industrial sectors (e.g. fast-moving consumer goods industry). The pilots should be carried out with the involvement and cooperation of relevant transport operators, logistic companies and infrastructure managers.\n- Assess and quantify the value generation (also in terms of sustainability and energy consumption reduction) of the proposed solutions for the shippers, multimodal operators and terminals.\n- Analyse and propose recommendations for contingency plans to address disruptions in multimodal supply chains.\n- Provide recommendations on possible revisions to the existing regulatory framework and propose initiatives to remove existing barriers to and facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of multimodal transport solutions.\nProposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan. Information exchange with Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking Flagship Area 5 is advised to avoid duplicated research.\nIf the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.",

          "scope": "With more than 50% of all EU road fatalities occurring in rural areas along with evidence suggesting that crashes and crash-related fatalities in rural roads vary from those in urban roads or motorways, it is imperative to understand and mitigate the safety risks in rural roads in view of the EU’s ambition to move towards Vision Zero by 2050. Local and regional authorities have an important role to play to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries.\nIn the EU, the Road Infrastructure Safety Management (RISM) Directive introduced the concept of network-wide road safety assessment (NWRSA) and the concept of proactive road safety assessment through the understanding of the in-built safety of roads. Considering safety at the network-level allows for an overview of the road safety performance instead of focusing on isolated parts of it, while the in-built safety assessment aims to identify parts of the road that have been omitted by crash-based analyses (such crash clusters or hotspot analysis) as they do not concentrate the majority of crashes, yet are crash-prone and/or uncomfortable to navigate. According to the provisions of the RISM Directive, a methodology has been developed to assess the network-wide safety of motorways and primary rural roads based on their combined crash-based and in-built safety assessments. While this is a first step in understanding road safety conditions on rural roads, secondary and lower-class roads are not covered and, at the same time, there is not adequate information on road user behaviour.\nIn an ageing society, cognitive and physical impairments pose an increasing threat to safe mobility. In rural areas, people with any kind of impairment or disability often lack alternatives to driving a car for their mobility needs. Addressing these issues will not only enhance road safety but also improve the quality of life and prevent the social exclusion of these people.\nIn addition to road safety issues, local and regional authorities manage risks associated with extreme weather phenomena and other natural disasters like floods, fires, storms or heavy snowfall. As these may affect safety and operations, relevant authorities need to adopt a more holistic resilience monitoring and response.\nResearch should support addressing these challenges by undertaking all the following actions in at least three regions covering both primary and secondary rural roads of adequate length to allow for region-level comparisons:\n- Demonstrate the practical applicability of the NWRSA methodology and expand its use to all rural roads for an easy, low-cost, flexible and transparent, yet sufficiently accurate assessment of road infrastructure safety. Identify information gaps and propose methods to leverage available data to supplement the understanding of crash causation and outcomes.\n- Develop prevention strategies and measures to reduce fatalities and serious injuries in rural areas with a focus on high-risk locations and situations and on improving road user behaviour. This includes the development of reliable and easy-to-use methods to provide quantified indications of the actual crash risk associated with and the prevalence of risky behaviours. Based on this, enforcement measures with evidence-based effectiveness in addressing the problems and motivations underlying risky behaviour should be proposed, combining traditional methods with innovative enforcement approaches and new technologies, also taking into account the issue of multi-offenders[[ A small group of repeat offenders account for a large share of crashes (e.g. 5% in population vs. 27% in crashes according to SWOV 2017 Progressief boetestelsel ) and intoxication by drugs ( Recent studies show that the share of crash-involved drivers intoxicated by drugs equals or even surpasses those intoxicated by alcohol [ Gjerde & Forst 2023 ].]]. These enforcement measures, complemented by suitable awareness raising and nudging measures as well as novel incentive mechanisms to promote safe driving, will form building blocks to design integrated strategies fostering safer behaviour according to the local needs and specificities of rural areas. A gender and disability sensitive and intersectional approach, which intersects with other social factors, could be considered. Crash prevention strategies should also include countermeasures to reduce the effects of health-related risk factors and to guarantee at the same time the mobility of older people and persons with health impairments in rural areas.\n- Develop tools to make knowledge about climate-related risks easily accessible to local authorities and to enable them to take appropriate actions in order to maintain road safety and the resilience of the rural road network and of the infrastructure for road users even in extreme conditions [1] .\nProjects should select those regions ensuring diversity in terms of road network design, geography and climate conditions, and road safety culture. At least two of those regions should be in countries with higher percentage of fatalities on rural roads than the EU average. The involvement of road authorities is strongly recommended.\n[1] Such tools may be based on results from projects under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11 (effects of disruptive changes in transport) as well as on other thorough analyses of how such situations were managed in the past and what can be improved.",

However, these systems face challenges such as operational disruptions, safety and security risks, and evolving passenger demands.\nIn the context of passenger transport, resilience refers to the ability of a transport system to absorb disturbances, maintain its basic structure and function, and recover to a required level of service within acceptable time and cost after being affected by disruption. This involves implementing measures that ensure continuous operation, quick recovery from unexpected events, and adaptability to changing circumstances. Enhanced resilience is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring smooth functioning of transport systems and it is a cornerstone of the EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.\nProposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Development and implementation of measures to enhance the resilience of urban, sub-urban and long-distance transport systems.\n- Leveraging digital technologies (e.g. big data, digital twins) and in particular generative and discriminative AI for anticipating and predicting the evolution of disruptions and their impacts, with real-time planning and information systems for minimizing impact and enabling faster recovery.\n- Use of innovative technologies for data acquisition and integrate data from various sources to inform decision-making and optimise strategies, and generate scenario libraries for different disruptive events and monitor the implementation of the response plans\n- Involve authorities and operators in the design process to create holistic solutions that are user-friendly and aligned with their needs.\n- Conducting safety and security assessments in data interpretation, ensuring decisions are based on objective factors while avoiding biases.\n- Test and validate the aspects above in real-life use cases in multimodal transport corridor within urban, sub-urban and long-distance passenger transport with minimum three transport modes per use cases (e.g. buses, metros, trams, trains, coaches, trolleybuses, ferries, share mobility) in at least three pilot sites situated in different Member States and reflecting a diversity of operational, geographic, and technological contexts.\nProposals are encouraged to building on results from previous calls on infrastructure and transport resilience (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11, MG-7-1-2017, HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-09), multimodal traffic management (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-05, MG-2-11-2020), shared mobility and public transport (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-04, HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-02).

          "scope": "An exceptional effort is needed to develop, demonstrate and de-risk essential renewable fuels technologies and establish their industrial value chains in a cost-effective way to cover the EU needs where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution. Proposals should steer the development of these technologies at EU level and bring them to the market. Pre-commercial procurement of R&D, validation and possibly, first deployment of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies is considered an effective tool to de-risk such activities and overcome the “valley of death” because real take off by engaging primarily concerned contracting entities is expected. The scope of this action is to design and bring industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies at TRL 8 by the action end. The competitive development in phases of entire industrial value chains should built upon existing knowledge on technology and value chain readiness based on existing EU projects and studies, thus speeding up the de-risking.\n‘Transnational buyers’ could be public plus possibly one or more private procurers, and that provide similar services of public interest. The buyers will collectively develop and implement the pre-commercial procurement of R&D services from a number of providers and designate a lead procurer to award the contracts. The procurement must be open to providers of R&D services established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.\nInclusiveness of a broad range of public and private procures across EU and Associated Countries and across national borders is encouraged, to effectively share the risk and benefit from creating in the EU market readiness of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies. Public and private EU airport and port authorities and their respective managing bodies, aircraft operators and shipping companies, other state, regional or local authorities and bodies governed by public law or their associations, are some examples of expected public [1] and private procurers with an incentive to improve solutions in areas of public interest, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply as fuels.\nThe consortium is encouraged to plan activities during the project to raise awareness to the R&D providers that will win PCP contracts about unlocking and increasing their investment capacity in the field of renewable fuel technologies, for example by using possible combinations of the PCP procurement contract with additional support for companies from the EIC, InvestEU, regional funds or possibly other sources of Union funding. Participation of public contracting authorities and entities managing or funding such funds in the project is encouraged. In addition, the procurers should include in the proposal what will be their planned approach for deployment in case the PCP results in successful solutions; this could be through a combination of deploying a limited set of solutions already during the PCP project and/or foreseeing a deliverable that prepares follow-up procurement to purchase (larger volumes of) such type of solution(s) after the PCP.\nEssential value chains to de-risk should be based on identified technologies by our studies [2] (i) – vii) below) as those that can contribute essentially to domestic commercial fuel production beyond 2030, and possibly other that can be demonstrated at commercial scale by the end of the execution phase of the project [3] :\n- Production of advanced bioEthanol and further processing into ATJ-SPK\n- Biomass Gasification and FT-Synthesis to produce FT-SPK\n- Production of BioMethanol for further processing into MTJ\n- Hydrotreatment of Lipids from marginal/contaminated lands to produce HEFA\n- Biomass Pyrolysis and Upgrading or co-processing to produce biokerosene and bio-heavy fuel oil\n- Biomethane from AD and Gasification and Methanation to produce biomethane for shipping or further processing into methanol (methanolysis) for shipping\n- E-Methanol production from CO2 and renewable H2 for shipping\nIndustrial value chains of the essential renewable fuel technologies should be developed based on domestic sustainable feedstocks across EU and Associated Countries and on also creating synergies across all end use energy and transport sectors for markets and production facilities for renewable fuels.\nHydrogen production as end-product is not in scope.\n[1] Public contracting authorities and entities as defined in REGULATION (EU) 2021/695, Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU\n[2] a) Study on Development of Outlook for the Necessary Means to Build Industrial Capacity for Drop-in Advanced Biofuels - European Commission , b) How To Mobilize Industrial Capacity Building For Advanced Biofuels\n[3] All hydrogen used to the production of the synthetic fuels should comply with the EU legislation on the renewable and low carbon methodology, i.e. the processes of Steam Methane Reforming using fossil fuels for the production are out of the scope, as there is no RI associated to these methods.",

For this purpose, the extraction of residues should respect locally defined retention thresholds for deadwood extraction and exclude negative impacts on soil quality and soil carbon\nTo minimise possible local ecosystem interferences, biomass fuels from residues and wastes are expected to be the primary feedstock of the high-efficiency CHP plant. The biomass fuels are expected to be produced with the use of innovative preprocessing and upgrading technologies and through the adoption of advanced supply chains from a mixture of residues and wastes and exclude negative impacts not only overall, but in each individual harvest location, which results in specific operational, economic and logistical and supply chain challenges to be addressed. Proposals should foresee at least one regional value chain demonstration including use of the solid biofuel with verified quality and occurring GHG and air-pollutant reduction in an operational high efficiency CHP plant. Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of feedstock providers (e.g. farmers, foresters, municipalities) to strengthen their position in the value chains relevant for this topic.\nProposals are expected to demonstrate ways for future efficient, cost-effective, robust, resilient and low pollution CHP plants (including retrofitting and excluding co-firing with fossil fuels) in a local industrial context.\nPlans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. In this respect, collaboration with suitable networks like e.g. bioenergy clusters should be envisaged to avoid the development of overly site-specific solutions and to enhance replicability. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG and air pollutant emissions reduction potential; projects will be encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs including the overall industrial ecosystem at the place of deployment. Projects are encouraged to support the reconstruction of Ukraine by covering regional value chains in Ukraine and/or Ukrainian beneficiaries.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, SSH research should look specifically at how synergies can be enhanced to achieve the topic’s objective in respect of socioeconomic sustainability.

Optimizing system designs and business practices will help to enable simultaneous land use creating synergy for both agriculture and electricity production; this can benefit farmers, lower PV costs and enable the European Union to reach the goals of the EU solar energy strategy.\nSimilarly, offshore/nearshore PV systems represent a tremendous deployment potential in Europe and globally, due to their advantages in conserving land resources and optimizing light utilization. However, prevailing technical challenges limit deployment in most sea conditions usually found in Europe.\nProject results are therefore expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, depending on the proposed system (agriPV or offshore/nearshore PV):\n- Harvesting of crops and photovoltaic electricity, providing sustainable solutions for energy production/use/efficiency, soil and biodiversity protection and water conservation.\n- Reinforce the European PV value chain, introduce new business models and open new markets for novel, bankable agri or offshore/nearshore PV systems.\n- Minimise the impact of PV on landscape/sea and environment exploiting its modularity and synergies of use. Promote offshore wind and PV co-location and system integration.\n- Significant improvement of designs that reduce both CAPEX and OPEX, maximize energy output and thus reduce LCoE.\n- Promote integrated and multi-dimensional policy design to overcome socio-technical challenges for agri and offshore/nearshore PV deployment.",

These dimensions need to be addressed holistically with the involvement of policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities working towards a just and equitable deployment of agriPV. In the case of offshore/nearshore PV, aesthetic appreciation, as well as possible conflicts of interest related to water areas (with e.g., commercial shipping, fishing, sand extraction, military use, and recreational sailing) or colocation should be looked at.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation as well as a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

All renewable fuel technologies, both of biological and non-biological origin, at all TRL levels and market up-take measures, which are listed in this Implementation Plan and its updated version(s), but also new identified interregional and transnational challenges across these value chains, are within scope, including for example feedstock standardization, permitting fragmentation and lack of fit-for-purpose business models in rural regions, and using artificial intelligence as appropriate. Activities should draw from the detailed R&I activities program of the Implementation Plan of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy (Annex I) regarding development, demonstration (also at pilot scale) and scale-up of\n- Advanced liquid and gaseous biofuels [3] through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and/or from autotrophic microorganisms and primary renewable energy.\n- Other renewable liquid and gaseous fuels [3] (with particular attention to direct solar and algae-based fuels but excluding hydrogen as end-product) through thermochemical/ chemical /biochemical /electrochemical transformation of energy neutral carriers (like CO2 or N2) with renewable energy.\n- Solid, liquid and gaseous intermediate bioenergy carriers through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and further upgrading to advanced biofuels\ntaking into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, the European Technology and Innovation Platform on Bioenergy (ETIP Bioenergy), the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) Bioenergy Joint Programme and the SET Plan Direct Solar Fuel forum as its SRIA becomes available.\nThe action may support networking and coordination, research and innovation, pilot actions, market uptake measures, training and mobility, awareness raising and communication, and dissemination and exploitation across an entire value chain of renewable fuel technologies, thus providing the highest possible flexibility for activities in supporting the related challenges. The action should establish a joint comprehensive plan of activities. The range of activities supported should include an appropriate set of research projects, demonstration projects, technology transfer projects and other activities.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed above in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nThe FSTP calls should take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal.\nThe FSTP calls should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs\nThe consortium is expected to ensure that eligibility for financial support to third parties is extended to participants established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [5] .\nInclusiveness of a broad range of EU Member States and Associated Countries is expected, aiming at involving also partners coming from Eastern Europe who could enable solutions, thus strengthening their engagement in the SET Plan. Participation of public interest legal entities such as state, and notably regional and local authorities, which may have particular interest in regional development of renewable fuel value chains, is encouraged.\nImplementation of the action should profit from and capitalize the expertise in collaborating and networking of the relevant R&D programmes of national governments of the ERA-NET-Bioenergy network [6] on European research cooperation and coordination related to the field of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, as well as from the EU ERA-NET BESTF3 [7] .\nThe action is expected to have a duration of 5 years. It is expected that the action will organize joint transnational calls on an annual basis and will consider ample time for the implementation of the co-funded projects, notably before its end. Flexibility in defining activities for joint calls and implementing these calls adjusted to specific needs among beneficiaries is encouraged while FSTP must be defined in accordance with legal application requirements [8] . Appropriate monitoring and reporting of the results is expected.\nThe proposal should envisage to design and carry out coordination and clustering activities of the co-funded projects and also with other Horizon Europe projects of renewable fuels. These activities should also include synergies, communication (joint meetings), dissemination and exploitation and contribute to the Knowledge Community of the CETPartnership.\nHydrogen production as end-product and heat and power production are not in scope.\n[1] TRI 3: Enabling Climate Neutrality with Storage Technologies, Renewable Fuels and CCU/CCS | CET Partnership\n[2] Action 8 Implementation Plan (in future “Common Implementation Plan”)\n[3] In line with the amended Renewable Energy Directive\n[4] In line with the amended Renewable Energy Directive\n[5] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[6] https://international.fnr.de/project-funding/european-projects/era-net/era-net-bioenergy\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/691637\n[8] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/information-on-financial-support-to-third-parties_he_en.docx",

          "scope": "The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and innovation priorities [1] and targets [1] for ocean energy focussing on wave and tidal energy development. It will take into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on ocean energy (IWG ocean), the European Technology and Innovation Platform on ocean energy (ETIP Ocean) [3] and the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) joint programme on ocean energy [4] .\nThe overarching objective is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave and tidal energy systems that can survive in a harsh ocean or sea environment with minimal impacts on health and the environment and biodiversity. The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave and tidal energy development for different type of resources in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market. In this action the following can be considered:\n- The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative wave energy devices.\n- The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative next generation tidal energy devices\n- The development and demonstration of new sustainable materials in ocean energy converters, moorings and foundations whilst ensuring structural integrity, durability and circularity can be considered.\n- The development and demonstration of sustainable tailored mooring and connection of electrical or other power transmission systems (cable system, electrical equipment, ....) for wave and tidal energy devices. Advance combined mooring and electrical connectors or hydraulic power transmission to reduce component cost and number of connection operations, included in systems for sharing an anchor between devices in arrays. Develop novel systems for safe and quick connection/disconnection that do not require large vessels and/or diving teams.\n- The instrumentation for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of ocean energy devices and structures. Apply recent advances in condition and structural health monitoring from other sectors to ocean energy. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ocean energy technology development.\n- Advanced manufacturing of ocean energy devices and structures and auxiliary equipment considering reduced energy, manufacturing costs and materials consumption, high production throughput and optimization of logistics.\n- Development of technologies and solutions for the installation, maintenance and decommissioning of wave and tidal energy devices.\nThe validation and demonstration of new ocean energy technologies should be done in a controlled environment meaning that this is done under monitored and reproducible conditions, using for instance, test rigs and test tanks, semi-enclosed basins, or dedicated real-sea demonstration sites with instrumented monitoring infrastructure.\nStructure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation\nThe action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities implemented through financial support to third parties. The latter can include cooperation with the activities undertaken by the beneficiaries of the EU grant and may complement them. The R&I activities are divided into three challenges:\n- Breakthrough challenge\n- Validation challenge\n- Demonstration challenge\nThe breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities. The demonstration challenge will solely be implemented by the core consortium.\nThe breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the ocean energy sector and on the acceleration of ocean energy deployment at scale. The aim is that the innovative technologies have been at least validated towards the end of the project.\nThe validation challenge entail actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment which have been developed in the project or have been developed previously or separately in other European and national projects. FSTP can be used for new illustrative application use-cases demonstrating well defined added value to end users.\nIn the demonstration challenge the consortium is expected to carry out demonstration activities (up to TRL 7) in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan ocean energy R&I priorities and targets and accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry. The demonstration activities will be selected using the stage gate approach developed by the IEA OES task 12 [5] .\nActivities directly implemented by the core consortium\nThe activities of the core consortium are expected to include direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects).\nIt is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.\nThe project is expected to carry out at least three demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone for each demonstration activity before entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project has to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans compliant with the applicable standards, and iv) a complete business and implementation plan. The proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these, while demonstrating how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.\nThe total maximum amount of EU funding for the activities in the demonstration challenge is expected to be 24 million Euros.\nActivities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)\nA share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to engage research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.\nThe use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, and to respond to disruptive developments, attracting different stakeholders and innovators. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or a by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful projects initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&I work can continue without major interruption.\nFor the FSTP calls that are related to the breakthrough challenge and the validation challenge, the following considerations should be taken into account:\n- Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of demonstrating and upscaling wave and tidal energy considering the full supply chain. Up to 3 million EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The challenge should aim at attracting new partners (academia, SMEs, scale ups) and solutions.\n- Validation challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 6 million EUR EU funding is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.\nThe first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP call for the validation challenge should be published in a later stage of the project enabling the use of the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core R&I activities.\nThe activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.\nFor the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.\nThe FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.\nApplicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities [6]\nGovernance of the project\nThe action will require a strong internal governance and strong procedures. In the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges/actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). It will have to set out how and the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.\nThe core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.\nThe project must, for all the research and innovation activities, including the FSTP actions, embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress following the stage gate metrics developed by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring and share communicable results with the European R&D community. The evaluation framework has already been introduced by the Europewave PCP action.\nThe project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.\nThe consortium will have to present a comprehensive risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.\nBesides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the ocean energy sector. [7] These annual reviews will be defined as milestones of the project and, as such, they will be subject to the approval of the granting authority.\nThe project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in ocean energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Ocean Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership (CET Partnership) related initiative, and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advised the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET plan activities. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.\nThe consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D community.\nFor activities in line with relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programme on Ocean Energy Systems (IEA TCP OES) [8] , proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research infrastructures 110 , especially the Marinerg-i distributed infrastructure specialising in sea applications., as well as related projects offering access research infrastructures in the ocean energy applications, such as RISEnergy (https://risenergy-project.eu) [9] .\nDuration\nThe estimated project duration is around 5 years.\n[1] See for instance: Ocean Energy - European Commission and Homepage - Oceanset\n[2] See for instance: Ocean Energy - European Commission and Homepage - Oceanset\n[3] ETIP | Home\n[4] See for instance: https://www.etipocean.eu/knowledge_hub/1738/\n[5] OES | Performance Metrics\n[6] European Commission (2025), Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants .\n[7] Ocean Energy - European Commission\n[8] OES | Ocean Energy Systems - an IEA Technology Collaboration Programme\n[9] https://risenergy-project.eu",

          "scope": "Renewable energy valleys are understood as decentralised renewable energy systems that offer a viable and efficient solution to the challenges mentioned above. For example, local production and consumption, reduced transmission and distribution losses thanks to the reliance on local networks for energy needs, greater operational flexibility and reduced dependence on expensive fuel imports all contribute to a higher energy autonomy, a more secure supply, and lower, more stable overall energy costs, including for individual citizens. In addition, this alleviates a part of the load on the centralised grid and avoids blockages by the capacity of the grid.\nThe action should cover either urbanised or rural contexts in Africa. It should contribute to providing sustainable renewable energy access and creating other socio-economic benefits, such as improved health, economic wealth, skills and jobs, while reducing the stress on the environment, notably on biodiversity, adopting a Water Energy Food Ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus approach and following methods of the circular economy [1] .\nActions are expected to cover the design, construct, commission and operate the demonstration installation, including aspects of energy needs and energy consumption, of grid stability and grid reinforcement in the region concerned. Actions should also develop and implement a tailored value chain approach, identifying the most suitable manufacturing value chains, on the basis of the local context, local material supply chain(s) and local workforce, with the objective of ensuring sustainable local economic development. A gender sensitive approach could further support the activities, taking into account relevant groups in a vulnerable situation such as rural communities, and women.\nAfrican SMEs are expected to play an important role in the overall value chain and to contribute in the identifying the needs. Participation of EU private sector actors should also be encouraged in alignment with the priorities of Global Gateway Strategy. Actions should also include the identification of technical, vocational and educational needs of the workforce and propose relevant training and qualification activities. Actions should finally define a market and business strategy that could take into consideration funding from European and international financial instruments and development finance programmes to ensure impact through a quick and viable commercial take-up of the technological solution demonstrated.\nSocial innovation should be considered. The business plan is expected to include appropriate consideration of available financial support instruments (local, regional and/or international) to enhance the speedy market deployment of the solution. The aspects of regulatory environment and local communities’ governance needs and/or impacts are also to be considered.\nProposals are expected to include a life cycle analysis showing the impact of the proposed solutions when compared to other technologies/solutions on the environment, on climate change targets and on the social and the economic dimensions, taking a cradle to grave viewpoint, encompassing the design and the operation phases. The life cycle analysis should take a cradle to grave approach. Proposals should adopt a circular economy approach. Whenever negative impacts have been identified, mitigations measures are expected.\nAs the demonstration installation will be located in Africa, relevant African partners have to participate in the implementation of the project. A balanced involvement in the activities of the projects of European and African partners will be considered an asset in the evaluation. Actions should also participate in and contribute to the African Union [2] - European Union collaborative research action on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy, in particular through cooperation/collaboration with the project LEAP-SE ( www.leap-re.eu ). Alignment with Global Gateway ongoing activities on renewable energy in Africa should be also prioritized, including the collaboration with EU Delegation and EU private sector actors in Africa, as well as with the Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA) and Cluster 6’s topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-02-two-stage.\nLesson learned from the implementation of European Renewable Energy Valleys projects should be considered. These projects are REFORMERS [3] and CRETE VALLEY [4] .\nProven access to necessary land and / or permits for operation at the time of application and / or convincing risk management regarding delayed availability of land or permits are expected in the proposal.\n[1] For an example of a methodology for the assessment of sustainability, circularity and contribution the EU resilience and technological autonomy of clean energy technology in the R&I pipeline, please see Study on circular approaches for a sustainable and affordable clean energy transition\n[2] “African Union member states” includes countries whose membership has been temporarily suspended.\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136211\n[4] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136139",

          "expected_outcome": "The REPowerEU plan and the EU Solar Energy Strategy introduced targets for the deployment of solar PV amounting to 600 GWac by 2030. Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel technologies offer therefore the opportunity to innovative start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of innovative PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.",

          "scope": "The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7 million for Area A and 5 million for Area B. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.\nScope area A) Circular economy for Electric Vehicle (EV) powertrains and infrastructure :\nImproving the circularity of EVs drivetrain components (such as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, gear assemblies and battery components excluding battery cells) and respective charging infrastructure is crucial for resource efficiency, sustainability, and compliance with evolving European regulations. Through durable design, predictive maintenance, refurbishment, etc, it is possible to extend the lifespan of critical components reducing material demand and waste, without jeopardising on the needed performance. Advanced monitoring systems can predict failures, enabling proactive repairs, and to inform improved future design strategies, and potential second life applications. Automated processes coupled with design for dismantling can facilitate efficient component recovery, reducing labour costs and improving material separation for high-value recycling.\nThe projects are expected to build on the results of projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-04 , HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09 and HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-04 , as well as to consider the methodologies proposed. They are expected to target at least the same technical performance levels for the electric motor as HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09 under real-life working conditions, while optimising the design for circularity.\nProposals are expected to address all the following research activities:\n- Component health monitoring for individual components on their RUL (first and subsequent) including assessment of preferred circularity strategy and expected impact on EV affordability. This includes considering the impact of wear patterns, material fatigue, and thermal stress to optimise circularity strategies and extend the lifespan of components.\n- Develop novel design concepts and processes to optimise material usage and extend components’ lifetime such as design for (automated) dismantling, in particular to reduce dependency on critical raw materials or enable use of alternatives.\n- Promote broader Circular Economy (CE) adoption and increase the potential of reuse, repair and refurbishment by respective design criteria, means of standardisation (assessment and relevant interfaces), usage of RUL monitoring and better understanding of market potential.\n- Ensure economic and environmental sustainability in the analysis of drivetrain performance and charging infrastructure (e.g. efficiency, package, user driving experience, CRM use, CE).\nScope area B) Data-driven life-cycle management of Electric Vehicle (EV):\nVehicle specific data is crucial for advancing circularity through the 9R-strategies in EVs across their lifecycle. However, this data is often not available nor accessible after vehicle production, or not measured in the use phase. Digital passports and track and trace models can improve accessibility to data, enabling predictive maintenance, lifetime extension, and optimised recycling. Harmonised data-sharing policies are essential to ensure interoperability across value chains while maintaining data security and GDPR compliance. Data governance frameworks must regulate ownership, access, and consent to protect privacy and ensure responsible use. The common European data spaces initiative, notably the common European Green Deal data space, and the Data4Energy expert group [2] offer a foundation for secure, standardised architectures, ensuring trust and controlled data sharing. Furthermore, efficiency in data collection and storage is also critical. By integrating advanced data strategies, EV manufacturers can unlock new business opportunities and improve efficiency, while complying with regulations.\nProposals are expected to address all the following research activities:\n- Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for track & trace for representative EV components (e.g. as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, or thermal management of the battery system) ensuring access to, at least, the minimum needed data needed ensuring economic viable upscale and especially agreement on how this data can be accessed to enable/improve life-cycle management. The costs and benefits of tracing these data points should also be considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data and data management tools produced in the context of this topic are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n- Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for measuring real-world operational loads (mechanical, electrical, thermal) experienced by the representative EV components complemented by operational and environmental usage of EV that are key for life-cycle management and assessment (LCA).\n- Develop and demonstrate in real-life conditions API-based approach to data management of use phase and EoL and open interfaces that enable new business models, allow to better quantify circularity improvements, while allowing its sharing across value chains and supply chains, in a secure and privacy-compliant way.\n- Concepts and solutions for product passports based on the use of digital twins (e.g. identification of relevant data points, stakeholders, in connection with existing platforms/passports, such as the battery passport, and platforms e.g. IDIS, IMDS, and Catena-X [3] ) while also considering LCA aspects.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Replication, recommendations and sharing of best practices shall be part of the demonstrations, as well as the development of new business models and the analysis of remaining legal barriers.\n- Develop shared charging solutions that can be used for multiple operators and other vehicle types. Both technical and operational issues must be addressed, as well as “rush hour” at charging stations, balancing demand and supply of energy. The use of charging solutions and shared charging hubs by a variety of mobility and transport operators must be explored, also incorporating seasonal effects and operational demands.\n- Based on user needs, develop flexibility in interior design to enhance travel comfort, safety and user experience, thus aiming at making it more appealing and inclusive to use this mode of transport.\n- Leverage on other 2Zero projects related to Buses and HDV should be considered.

To this end, numerous advancements (e.g., electric and hybrid propulsion systems, wind-assisted propulsion technologies, hull optimization, air lubrication systems etc.) have been made across various aspects of ships. However, a high energy-efficient vessel requires addressing specific challenges despite the significant technological advancements. One of the most critical factors relates to the combination and integration of different solutions and measures that may lead to additional energy savings concerning multiple ship elements such as energy conversion, propulsion, onboard energy consumer demands (e.g., hotel loads for passenger vessels, operation equipment for offshore vessels etc.), higher-efficiency conventional or alternative power systems and others without compromising the ship’s safety and performance.\nAdaptability across different ship types and scalability, particularly for large vessels, are further challenges that require meticulous analysis.

          "scope": "This topic aims to improve the suitability of fully-battery-electric operation of ferries, short sea shipping, offshore and inland vessels, considering the services they provide, their operation profiles and the possibilities to interact with charging infrastructure. Aspects like increasing the autonomy range of operation and fast charging are a crucial element for short sea shipping and inland routes with short docking periods. Fast charging may also put added strain on batteries in terms of output and durability. Optimization of the onboard electrical architecture and battery chemistry as well as optimized battery monitoring and management systems and more extensive training of crew can to some extent address this challenge. Life cycle aspects should be considered by design in the integration and operation of vessels, as well as the end-of-life of batteries, making sure that operations can be performed during the whole expected life of the vessel. The topic also explores the need to increase the power capability of fully electric vessels, aiming to define scenarios in which the increase of the peak propulsion power is needed to ensure the safety of operations. Proposals should cover the interface between vessels and port operations addressing the regulatory requirements, including operational procedures.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Full scale demonstration of innovative solutions for extended range and extended battery cycles beyond simple scaling up of existing commercial batteries. Solutions to increase the current operational range of electric vessels to at least 150 nm (or 277.8 KM for inland navigation) for short-sea shipping, ferries, offshore of 400-6500 GT vessels, or 86-135 meters for inland river vessels on free-flowing rivers upstream, allowing rapid in route charging and being applicable to representative operating conditions of the chosen ship. Demonstration of the vessel’s economic viability in normal operation. Demonstrations should also consider baseline reference which are already state of the art\n- Identifying the operational profiles and services that require higher energy output for safe and effective operation, developing solutions and modelling scenarios to ensure safe and efficient energy management and navigation taking into account the battery pack and recharging possibilities.\n- Incorporating energy-efficiency measures, including but not limited to, efficient AC-DC grid, thermal management, high voltage electrical components, energy management and energy modelling for optimal operation.\n- Implementation of vessel‑wide adaptive energy‑management solutions that coordinate battery, propulsion and hotel loads, maximising cycle life while minimising emissions.\n- Development of solutions for intelligent and optimized battery management to improve energy efficiency and life extension of the batteries. Furthermore, projects should consider life cycle aspects by design and address the end-of-life of batteries to ensure full electric operation during and beyond the planned operation of the vessel.\n- Creating concepts for rapid zero-emission in-route charging, fast charging, offshore charging or battery replenishment, including solutions capable of supplying power to idling vessels anchored offshore near ports, while maintaining desired operating schedules, adhering to current standards.\n- Encouraging modular design and ship retrofitting to facilitate replication of the solution, ideally presenting one full retrofit exercise and several replications in similar or different vessels, also including the needs of the OPS infrastructure.\n- Development of recommendations and best practices for the safety assessment of the novel installations based on field testing. This should build on established safety guidelines and requirements such as the Guidance on the Safety of Battery Energy Storage Systems onboard ships (from the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA) and the requirements for fixed and swappable batteries on inland vessels (from the European Committee For Drawing Up Standards In The Field Of Inland Navigation – CESNI), as applicable, and contribute to their applicability to a wider scope of novel electrification solutions. Furthermore, recommendations for improving the guidelines and extending them to the demonstrated new battery installation solutions should be presented. Regulatory aspects for the pertinent safety-critical ship systems as well as fire safety solutions for the battery room should also be addressed. In addition, the recommendations should also consider how integration of the safety considerations affects the overall operational planning and economic assessments.\n- The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business cases and provide roadmap for the replication and deployment of the proposed technology, including plans for scalability, commercialization, and deployment. Proposals should identify and propose opportunities for further market uptake.\n- Establishment of strong collaboration between industry, training providers and higher education institutions to develop specialized courses on enhanced waterborne transport battery management.\nProposals must justify the contribution of their objectives, results, intellectual property (IP) management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

          "scope": "Aviation emissions not only have an impact on climate change and on GHG emissions but also on-air quality as it is recognized that airport-related sources of emissions release pollutants that can contribute to the degradation of air quality of their nearby communities. As such, air quality and noise issues in the vicinity of airports need to be investigated, quantified and addressed. Airports operations can generate water pollution due to their extensive handling of jet fuel and de-icing chemicals, which, if not contained, can contaminate nearby water bodies. Similarly, attention must be given to other possible airport-related environmental impacts associated with noise, water quality, and local ecology in the vicinity of airports.\nIn order to address these issues, the following R&I actions should be undertaken:\n- Comprehensive real time and real-world measurements of pollutant (exhaust and non-exhaust, including resuspension of dust) and noise emissions. The sources of emissions should be differentiated, and the pollutants identified. Operations should include ground operations, landing and take-off (including emissions from tyres and brakes) and assessing exhaust emission during cruising, including impact of changes in flight altitude on engine performance parameters (stationary engine tests). The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated.\n- Pilot testing in 2 different airports (possibility as well for testing on other complex transport nodes) for proof of concept with the aim of increasing scalability and replicability for other similar environments. Proposals are expected to select specific airports that are in vicinity of urban/rural communities and close to water streams/bodies, to examine and quantify the effect of airport emissions on air quality, noise and water bodies.\n- Investigation of the adverse health and environmental effects (including biodiversity) of particle emissions, NOx, and non-regulated emissions (e.g. black carbon, tyre and brake particles, secondary organic aerosols, etc.) generated from aircraft and airport operations. The analysis should be supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis.\n- Estimates of the impact of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit) or GPUs (Ground Power Units) to stationary aircrafts’ emissions (GHG, air pollutants and noise) compared to conventional operation.\nProposals should consider the results from previously EU funded projects such as AVIATOR , nPETS , TUBE , ANIMA , NEEDED or any other similar projects.",

This includes the capability from online calculation of optimal countermeasures to ensure safety, and reduce any negative impacts on all road users, by considering available infrastructure (including also automated and connected digital components, like sensors, intelligent traffic control systems, cooperative communication), and overall conditions. Such an architecture also needs to address relevant requirements, particularly in technology and near and far communications, outlining the technical standards and investments necessary for risk mitigation. These may include solutions to increase road users’ situational awareness and the provision of reliable, accurate and timely warnings.\n- Establishment of working methods and harmonization of interfaces with national/local road authorities, operators and emergency services (e.g. first responders in case of accidents), including remote operations and road enforcement. The aim must be the creation or adaption of decision-support tools that can be integrated with mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services. This also includes the definition of related shared governance models. Understanding of the requirements for public road authorities (national and local) to address CCAM critical cases, defining their role in supporting and enabling CCAM operations.\n- Enhanced user acceptance through holistic CCAM solutions addressing their individual needs and requirements as e.g. road user, customer, operator, service provider, etc., in terms of trust, safety, security, etc.",
          "scope": "Based on the preliminary and final findings of HEADSTART [1] , SUNRISE [2] , EVENTS [3] , ROADVIEW [4] and SYNERGIES [5] (among others), this call is focussing on CCAM solutions for critical cases, specifically situations and events that are less regular and of higher risk. These cases may also include emergency conditions and unplanned events, on local and on larger (regional, national, European) scale, such as extreme weather conditions, road incidents, cyberattacks, traffic disruptions, and sudden loss of coverage of the Operational Design Domain (ODD).\nCCAM operations may be disturbed under multiple scenarios, and can vary according to the type of road, road attributes, traffic conditions, available infrastructure and technology, malfunctions, incidents, etc. Depending on the specific circumstances and the dimension of the disturbance, the impact on CCAM operations and involved agents (e.g. road users, vehicles, VRUs, infrastructure components, emergency services, operators) may vary. According to the case and the dimension of the incident, different entities and actors of the CCAM system (and even beyond, e.g. regulatory bodies and emergency and crisis response centres) are involved and may need to take part to resolve these events in a resilient, safe and secure way.\nThis call adopts a holistic approach, investigating critical cases not only from technological/infrastructure or vehicle-related perspectives (e.g., edge cases for automated vehicles) but also from the viewpoint of the user, customer, service provider, authority, city, etc. In particular, the focus is on how the CCAM system addresses and mitigates potential negative consequences of such events, including safety risks, emissions, loss of trust, and similar impacts. Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Development of a clustered list of critical scenarios, impacted entities, role and relation of all stakeholders, the estimated impact and the optimal kind of CCAM-based countermeasure.\n- Development and testing of tools and services for the detection of critical situations and edge cases, also based on the tools and approaches for robust environment perception done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02.\n- Development and testing of CCAM-based countermeasure solutions. Where applicable, the use of artificial intelligence methods and digital infrastructure support should be considered, aligned also to the tools and approaches for robust decision making done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02. The solutions also should reference common EU Emergency Response Protocols, e.g. for first responders. Also, the creation of decision-support tools and the integration of those into mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services must be considered. In general, customer/user understanding and trust in the CCAM system is crucial in the adoption of a new service. In building trust, it is vital to take into consideration the user perspective and investigate how critical cases can be managed in a way that is effective for the improvement of customer perception.\n- Validation and evaluation of solutions in terms of resulting risk reduction and potential negative impacts of critical cases. Solutions will need to be targeted against the scenarios identified and the stakeholders affected and would aim to either eliminate the risk to the service resilience or reduce its likelihood and impact as far as reasonably practicable. This also includes the quantification of the impact, which may also be deduced by using simulation. In addition, also the integration of the solutions into existing platforms needs to be validated in relevant environments (TRL 5). The outcomes of this call are expected to feed into future CCAM demonstrations.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProjects funded under this topic are expected to build on the insights and outcomes of the CCAM Technology Observatory, exploring and leveraging complementarities between their own activities and the Observatory’s findings.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [6] .\n[1] https://www.headstart-project.eu/\n[2] https://ccam-sunrise-project.eu/\n[3] https://www.events-project.eu/\n[4] https://roadview-project.eu/\n[5] https://synergies-ccam.eu/\n[6] See the evaluation methodology here .",

          "scope": "Several coordination and stakeholder concertation tools have been established to support the alignment and international outreach of CCAM projects. The FAME project developed a European framework for CCAM testing, evaluation and data sharing and managed the EU-wide Knowledge Base that consolidates information related to CCAM R&I and testing based on results from European and national projects, aiding researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals The platform will be extended in the project funded under the call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05 [2] to address public authorities and citizens.\nRegular events such as the European Conference on Connected and Automated Driving (EUCAD) and EUCAD symposia, international outreach activities and interactions with the Member States Advisory Group (SRG), extend the work of the CCAM Partnership and facilitate and support international dialogues to exchange knowledge and align activities across Europe and globally, at research and regulatory level.\nThe purpose of this exchange and alignment is to address and overcome barriers to the deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV) in Europe. Since 2022, Europe has introduced several regulatory developments aimed at facilitating the rollout of highly automated vehicles. The Implementing Act for Automated Driving Systems 2022/1426, the amendment to the Delegated Regulation 2022/2236 on type-approval, as well as the UNECE WP.29 Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) have all proposed frameworks and methods to ensure the safety of CCAM systems on the road. Despite these advances, a major challenge persists: the fragmented regulatory landscape for CCAM in Europe, which continues to hinder large-scale deployment. The FAME [3] and Hi-Drive [4] projects are working on recommendations for a harmonized open road-testing framework. Projects like HEADSTART [5] , SUNRISE [6] , and SYNERGIES are operationalizing the UNECE New Assessment/Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM) scenario-based approach. The project funded by call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02 [7] will extend the safety assurance framework (SAF) with ‘In-Service Monitoring and Reporting’ post-deployment. Coordination mechanisms are essential as Member States update regulations to align perspectives and support common approval procedures.\nProposed actions are expected to address the following aspects:\n- Extend the EU Knowledge Base with practical tools that support safe deployment, not only supporting researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals, but also addressing public authorities and citizens, to establish and prepare the implementation of a long-term sustainability plan for structure.\n- Accelerate the exchange and cooperation between relevant European and international stakeholders, including Member States and Associated Countries, with the purpose to accelerate deployment. This by means of co-organizing high-level events such as the EUCAD conference and to coordinate with a large-scale cooperation (such as an IPCEI).\n- Develop and implement practical safety assessment procedures, as well as a framework for the secure exchange of applications for open road-testing permits across European Member States, with acknowledgement for specific MS regulations and context.\n- Support the realization of EU-wide federated scenario databases, with European in-depth accident databases.\nThe project funded under this topic is expected to continue the management and hosting of the CCAM Technology Observatory, including its database and content.\n[1] https://synergies-ccam.eu/\n[2] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069898\n[4] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006664\n[5] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824309\n[6] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069573\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203230",

          "scope": "EU policies, such as the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the European Green Deal, emphasise the need for inclusive, efficient, accessible and sustainable transport systems that leave no one behind. Transport poverty refers to individuals’ and households’ inability or difficulty to meet the costs of private or public transport, or their lack of or limited access to transport needed for their access to essential socioeconomic services and activities. Considering the national and spatial context, transport poverty affects both rural and underserved urban areas. Addressing this challenge requires innovative multimodal transport solutions which integrate various modes efficiently, leveraging digitalisation, shared mobility, and demand-responsive transport to enhance affordability, reliability, and accessibility, thereby ensuring Mobility as a Right.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Building on the outcome of previous calls and existing knowledge (e.g. SMARTA-NET [1] , the study on Novel policy ideas for a shift to low-carbon mobility [2] , the study on Transport poverty: definitions, indicators, determinants, and mitigation strategies [3] and other relevant EU-funded projects [4] ), and drawing on the feedback experience of existing innovative mobility solutions (e.g. SMARTA-NET Catalogue of rural shared mobility solutions [5] ), investigate strategies to enhance availability and accessibility of sustainable and inclusive transport services in sparsely populated regions with limited transport options.\n- Analyse the demand for mobility services in regions and communities affected by transport poverty and investigate which drivers could facilitate transport users in a vulnerable situation (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport) to use public transport or other shared mobility options (including e.g. underutilised regional and secondary rail lines or feeder services to main rail corridors).\n- Develop new sustainable and inclusive integrated multimodal solutions that ensure seamless transitions between rural and urban transport modes, improving first- and last-mile connectivity. Solutions should focus on vulnerable and low-income households (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport), and should combine, in an optimal (economic, social, environmental, and operational) way, the various modal transport offers to go beyond forced car ownership. Developing new digital platforms is out of the scope of this topic.\n- Each proposal must include pilot demonstrations in at least 4 pilot sites. The pilot demonstrations must cover 4 different areas across the EU and Associated Countries ensuring geographical balance and diversity of issues addressed (e.g. presence or not of transport services such as regional trains, frequency of services, population density). Each proposed issue must be addressed in at least two pilots. The pilots must be community-driven, carried out under the lead or with the involvement of rural/local/regional public authorities/administrations and the local transport authorities, and these entities must be included in the consortium as beneficiaries.\n- Elaborate and propose plans for a possible implementation of the developed and tested solutions by local authorities and transport authorities/operators.\n- Through the active engagement of public transport operators, local authorities, rural communities, and civil society organisations, through the European Rural Mobility Network (ERMN) [6] , elaborate a roadmap to implement and scaling up the tested solutions, while ensuring widespread adoption across diverse regional contexts.\nProposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative [7] through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan.\nIf the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot :\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable designing inclusive transport systems that consider accessibility, equity, and digital literacy. Proposals should consider citizens engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and support.\n[1] https://www.smarta-net.eu/\n[2] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ae58bebf-b2b9-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1\n[3] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b300f5f-b125-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[4] Various shared mobility solutions have been demonstrated in multiple European projects, including , SMARTA2 , LAST MILE , MAMBA , INCLUSION , MARA , MELINDA , Hi-Reach , UPPER and SPINE .\n[5] Solutions – SMARTA-NET\n[6] ERMN – SMARTA-NET\n[7] CIVITAS",

Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel tandem technologies offer therefore the opportunity for innovative spin-offs or start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain and thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- Increase the potential for commercialisation of tandem PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\n- Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;\n- Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

          "expected_outcome": "Large PV systems such as utility scale PV are evolving towards higher voltage architecture (>=3kV) with the objective to minimize losses and improve system efficiency at lower costs. The intention is to integrate also storage into such (hybrid) PV systems offering flexibility. It is consequently essential to build a blueprint for the implementation of high voltage large PV systems and the development of Direct Current (DC) networks around strategic end users for high voltage demand (industrial sites, servers, electric vehicle charging stations…). Understanding the factors that influence the performance and economics of these system architectures will help system planners evaluate the potential benefits of such hybrid resources that could support an increasing future industrial electrification. Another crucial challenge to address in ensuring the continued growth of new investments in solar PV, is the increasing occurrence of zero or negative prices in the electricity market, which dramatically hurt the profitability of operating solar PV assets. To tackle this challenge, PV participation to ancillary services is a way forward, which would reduce significantly system operating costs and PV curtailment and improve system reliability and PV profitability. The coupling/pooling with other generation assets or storage/demand assets is also to be considered.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes as indicated for the proposed scope (high voltage DC PV systems or PV participation in electricity markets):\nScope 1: High-voltage DC PV systems:\n- Highly efficient PV systems, optimal utilisation of generated PV electricity, energy savings;\n- Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and affordable electricity for industrial users.\nScope 2: PV participation in electricity markets:\n- Increased social profitability of PV by participation to ancillary services;\n- Energy efficient, cost competitive and flexible contribution of PV systems to the energy markets.\nAll proposals are expected to support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.",

          "scope": "Projects are expected to be the de-risking first step to develop local or regional industrial CCUS clusters, i.e. (multi) source and (multi) sink solutions for the decarbonisation of the hard-to-abate industries of the region. Projects are expected to be the basis and orientation for future full-size projects. To maximise the impact, projects should have a substantial industrial involvement.\nProjects should address most, but not necessarily all of the below issues:\n- Detailed planning and preparation for retrofitting capture systems to existing industrial plants;\n- Demonstrating important system components;\n- Identification and characterisation of the clustering potential of (cross-border) regional CO2 emitters;\n- Optimisation of industrial symbiosis between emitters and potential users of CO2;\n- Development of tools to optimise the design and operation of the cluster(s) and operate CO2 streams with different compositions, flow rates and operating regimes to comply with the constraints for the shared transport and storage infrastructure;\n- Identification of potential regional users of a common CO 2 infrastructure (this could also include enlargement counties, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova);\n- Comprehensive economic and technical assessment to identify the best (multimodal) transport options, including the re-use of existing infrastructure;\n- Development of business models for regional CO2 transport networks, including for dispersed industrial sites to link these to larger industrial clusters or pipeline networks;\n- Consideration of feasible CO2 geological storage services\n- Comprehensive set of studies and preparatory actions leading to permitting;\n- Scenarios for integrating CO2 infrastructure in (plans for) regional, national and/or cross-border energy networks (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas), also in relation to future changes in industrial landscape and energy supply mix.\nProjects are expected to deliver a strategy for the exploitation of results that includes plans for scalability, commercialisation, deployment, permitting procedures, and identified public and private funding sources for CAPEX and OPEX, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the Regional Development policy funds.\nFor CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and (in particular onshore) geological storage, public acceptability is paramount. Therefore, projects are expected to identify and engage relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) in deliberative activities, so as to consider and respond to their needs and concerns.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of R&I activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.",
