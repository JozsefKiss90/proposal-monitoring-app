      "scope": "Not least thanks to the Horizon 2020 cluster on science diplomacy, which funded three projects in 2016-2022 [2] , a vibrant community of European science diplomacy scholars and practitioners has emerged, leading to the development of the EU Science Diplomacy Alliance [3] . Further input was delivered by the former Strategic Forum for International S&T Cooperation (SFIC) [4] , which suggested the development of an EU Science Diplomacy Platform and Roadmap. In addition, a growing number of Member States have adopted national science diplomacy strategies or agendas, or are currently exploring their development, and have strengthened scientific-technological capacities in their Ministries of Foreign Affairs (e.g., establishment of an informal Network of Science Advisors and Science Diplomacy Coordinators in EU Ministries of Foreign Affairs). An increasing number of recent EU policy documents have made explicit or implicit reference to science diplomacy and the need for foreign policy to be based on the best possible evidence. Against the background of a rapidly changing geopolitical and scientific-technological environment, with global competitors using science diplomacy in a much more strategic manner, there is a need to consolidate European science diplomacy efforts and explore synergies to tackle existing vulnerabilities.\nScience diplomacy forms an integral part of the Global Approach to Research and Innovation [5] , the EU’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, which prominently advocates that a stronger focus on science and technology in the EU’s foreign and security policies in terms of science diplomacy would help the EU to project soft power and pursue our economic interests and fundamental values more effectively. In its Conclusions on the Global Approach [6] , the Council called on the Commission and the European External Action Service to develop a European Science Diplomacy Agenda. At the informal Competitiveness Council meeting in July 2023, EU Research Ministers underlined the importance of European science diplomacy action. Consequently, the European Commission organised together with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU the first European Science Diplomacy Conference in Madrid in December 2023 and the launch of EU Science Diplomacy Working Groups to develop recommendations for a potential future European framework for science diplomacy.\nAgainst this background, the Coordination and Support Action will contribute to consolidating the European science diplomacy landscape both in research and in practice. In particular, it should provide, once operational, a mapping of all relevant players, which is still lacking at this point, and establish a European Science Diplomacy Platform [7] . The added value of such a platform is that it can serve as a “do tank”, bringing together scientists (including from SSH disciplines) and diplomats alike and delivering concrete support for policy needs, such as:\n- advising on the use of science diplomacy to help achieving the EU’s foreign and security policy goals (e.g., in the context of Global Gateway [8] ),\n- identifying research needs and providing expert knowledge to policymakers and diplomatic services through science advice and science communication, thereby strengthening multilateralism and democratic governance,\n- designing methods for assessing the impact of relevant actions,\n- exploring synergies with other fields of diplomacy, most notably tech / innovation / digital diplomacy, as well as public diplomacy and culture diplomacy, including the use of arts to communicate science related to global challenges,\n- assisting policy dialogues with audiences and stakeholders in third countries as well as international organizations and other multilateral settings, and\n- supporting the EU’s science diplomacy outreach to partners world-wide, including to relevant international organizations, such as UNESCO.\nIn addition, this Coordination and Support Action should explore and develop mechanisms for training, capacity-building, and mutual learning in science diplomacy in a consistent manner, including by exploring the feasibility of science diplomacy fellowship schemes in European and Member State/Associated Countries’ institutions at home and in diplomatic representations abroad.\nEngagement with partners outside the EU is particularly encouraged for this project.\nParticular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/4b319f3d-e9ff-11ef-b5e9-01aa75ed71a1\n[2] Using Science for/in Diplomacy for Addressing Global Challenges (S4D4C) , Inventing a Shared Science Diplomacy for Europe (InsSciDE) , European Leadership in Cultural, Science and Innovation Diplomacy (EL-CSID)\n[3] https://www.science-diplomacy.eu\n[4] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/science-diplomacy/sfic_en\n[5] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-05/ec_rtd_com2021-252.pdf\n[6] https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12301-2021-INIT/en/pdf\n[7] Creating links with existing platforms such as the EU’s Cultural Relations Platform and the EU Alumni Platform .\n[8] Global Gateway - European Commission (europa.eu)",

      "scope": "Hybrid threats, and more specifically the phenomena of disinformation and FIMI [3] are a growing danger for democracy, human rights, social cohesion, and European security. In recent years, the EU has developed and started to implement several strategies and numerous projects to counter disinformation and FIMI.\nThe aim of this action is to bring to society the benefits from previously EU-funded research (including SSH research) dealing with disinformation and FIMI in the field of democracy and governance be it in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe or other relevant programmes (such as Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values, Digital Europe, and Global Europe). For this, proposals should build on the rich stock of actionable recommendations, knowledge, toolkits, educational material, and scientific methods etc. developed in particular by the several Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects on disinformation and FIMI and make them accessible to a wider audience (i.e., professionals in various sectors, including media, education, security, defence, transport, foreign relations, ICT, etc.).\nSeveral projects [4] funded under Horizon 2020 have aimed to conceive and implement solutions that help professionals spot and debunk mis- and disinformation and information manipulation or address hybrid threats. Proposals should indicate which Horizon 2020 projects are considered sources of research results relevant to the activities to be carried out and are encouraged to seek collaboration with these research teams. Recent projects funded under Horizon Europe investigate specifically the FIMI phenomenon. Proposals should build on, and seek cooperation with, past and on-going EU-funded projects, [5] as well as EU-led initiatives, such as the One-Stop-Shop for Tackling R&I Foreign Interference. Proposals should indicate which additional Horizon Europe projects they would build on, should there be more than those funded under the mentioned topics.\nProposals should further develop frameworks already in use by FIMI and disinformation practitioners (such as the DISARM Framework). Proposals should also consider the work done by the EDMO Hubs [6] and find ways to integrate these results into the advisory support and design actions to disseminate Hubs.\nThe capacity-building activities and advisory support should be addressed to a wide range of stakeholders and potential end-users, including non-scientific and non-academic actors, such as public bodies, NGOs, fact-checkers, civil society organisations, policymakers, educational bodies, law practitioners, or other potential end-users of the research results. The involvement of one or more of these categories of stakeholders is required to test and take up the research results and to explore their readiness to be implemented and replicated. Those activities and support could also involve signatories of the Code of Conduct on Disinformation, media companies, public and private broadcasters, online news platforms, and digital services object of the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), and other private entities, such as providers of intermediaries’ services under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The involvement of these categories of stakeholders is required to provide researchers with access to data necessary to undertake research and access to platform data on the spread and behaviour of disinformation online.\nWith the emergence of new technologies (especially those based on [generative] Artificial Intelligence and the use of Big Data), the actors promoting disinformation and FIMI activities have significantly increased their capacity to act, they are able to develop more targeted content across a broader spectrum of sectors, and they are more effective than disinformation approaches based for instance on bot farms [7] . AI could also be used to develop new disinformation detection technologies, while addressing the ethical and legal challenges implied.\nProposals should identify gaps in research, in particular with regards to access to data, as well as other obstacles to large-scale scientific inquiry of disinformation and FIMI threats. They should identify challenges and opportunities based on an analysis of ongoing and past research and innovation projects, particularly those offered by generative Artificial Intelligence in the context of generation, dissemination, detection and debunking of disinformation and FIMI activities more broadly. The proposals should make concrete recommendations on how the gaps in research could be filled.\nProposals are encouraged to also address the issue of identity-based disinformation and FIMI targeting LGBTIQ people.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/directing-responses-against-illicit-influence-operations-d-rail\n[2] https://www.disarm.foundation/framework\n[3] See: https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/tackling-disinformation-foreign-information-manipulation-interference_en\n[4] Such as EU-HYBNET ( https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883054 ).\n[5] In particular, projects funded under HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-01: Detecting, analysing and countering foreign information manipulation and interference; HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-02: Developing a better understanding of information suppression by state authorities as an example of foreign information manipulation and interference; HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised.\n[6] https://edmo.eu/about-us/edmo-hubs/\n[7] See: https://edmo.eu/edmo-news/new-white-paper-on-generative-ai-and-disinformation-recent-advances-challenges-and-opportunities/",

      "scope": "As stressed in several Commission’s communications [1] and following the granting of the candidate country status to Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, there is a need to invest more in understanding enlargement priorities, opportunities, and challenges based on the perspective of a EU counting more than 30 Member States. This also means that EU Member States need to be better prepared, while citizens and civil society must gain a better understanding of what enlargement entails.\nThe proposed research should improve on the one hand, the EU Member States’ understanding of the history, political and economic situation of the candidate countries and potential candidates, through socio-historical research, combined with a legal and economic approach (including expertise from relevant SSH disciplines). And, on the other hand, it should support EU citizens and civil society to gain a better understanding on challenges and opportunities related to potential future enlargements of the EU.\nReflecting on previous enlargements, the proposals should provide thematic insights on lessons learned and identify potential similarities with the candidate countries, focusing particularly on democracy, rule of law and governance-related topics.\nAdopting a flexible and adaptive approach to enlargement, responsive to geopolitical dynamics and regional challenges, might be necessary. Utilizing foresight and scenario planning can help the EU and the Member States to anticipate future changes and strategically manage the enlargement process. This approach can also consider differentiation within EU governance to build resilient, inclusive, and participatory societies.\nA comparative analysis of the detailed terms and conditions of membership in the accession treaties, both regarding terms and conditions issued by Member States and acceding countries upon joining the Union, such as transition periods for the freedom of movement of workers and persons, or the acquisition of real estate, could serve as an interesting case study for candidate countries and other stakeholders involved in this process. Public support and engagement for EU enlargement are crucial but fluctuate largely between Member States and candidate countries. To foster a more inclusive process, it is essential for the proposals to involve citizens early in the enlargement discussions, ensuring transparency and addressing political, economic and social concerns aiming at improving the credibility and acceptance of the enlargement process. The proposals should also address the EU’s readiness to enlarge, considering the “enlargement fatigue” and the rise of euroscepticism within the Union and in the candidate countries.\nBuilding concrete knowledge through comparative analysis of the motives of candidate countries to join the EU would be beneficial to observe any similarities and whether these motivations are still present, strengthened or declining in the Member States. Efforts should also be directed towards effective and inclusive communication on the EU integration process and the benefits of enlargement.\nAdditionally, the proposals should collect evidence on the role of societal dialogues and education in proposing learning approaches to EU integration and enlargement prospect within the Union. This research could combine mutual, social and intercultural learning to support the development of local or regional initiatives by the civil society. These learning approaches could also be based on evidence from formal learning in education institutions or informal learning through civil society initiatives. Proposals should consider citizens’ engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and encourage youth participation.\nTo support this goal, the proposals should identify the most effective tools for public administration and policymakers to improve citizens’ understanding of the enlargement process, seizing educational opportunities and societal awareness. Utilising emerging digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and social media could be beneficial in meeting the crucial needs to use digital communication.\nPilots should be carried out in at least four EU Member States to assess the effectiveness of these tools, which may also have synergies with people-to-people programmes such as Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, Interreg, or the Civil Society Facility, fostering a common European spirit between EU Member States and candidate countries.\nBased on the research, policy recommendations should be developed to promote inclusive strategic communication and citizen engagement on EU integration and values within the Union and in the Member States. These policy recommendations should also explore how to support the reform process of candidate countries and/or learn from their existing reforms regarding Chapters of the Acquis, such as of Chapter 10 (Information Society and Media), Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights), Chapter 24 (Justice Freedom and Security), and Chapter 34 (Institutions).\nProposals are encouraged to network with and build on previously funded projects under Horizon Europe calls [2] , Horizon 2020 or other EU programmes, e.g. Global Europe [3] or the Instrument for Pre-accession [4] . Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nApplicants to this topic are also encouraged to consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities domain [5] .\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "The EU's open strategic autonomy refers to the EU's ability to act autonomously (i.e., without depending on other countries) in strategically important policy areas, linked to both the economic and non-economic spheres. These areas may include energy, research, health, media, technology, defence, food, industry, as well as development cooperation, promotion of democracy and defence and promotion of human rights.\nThe concept of open strategic autonomy is not new, and its interpretation has changed, producing various legislative and non-legislative initiatives in several areas of key importance for the EU and its Member States. Since 2021, the scope of the EU's open strategic autonomy has been expanded to practically all EU policy areas, including that of democracy and governance, but other similar concepts also emerged. In recent years and since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 in particular, progress has been made towards achieving (open) strategic autonomy, although the concept remains clouded by changing terminology.\nThe European Economic Security Strategy was launched in June 2023 [1] , setting out a framework for robust assessment and management of economic security risks at EU, national and corporate levels. In December 2023, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) published a report assessing open strategic autonomy in the innovation and production domains [2] . It observes that, in addition to pure economic dependencies, the changing geopolitical landscape has increased potential vulnerabilities stemming from international collaboration in research and innovation. In May 2024, the Council adopted a Recommendation on Enhancing Research Security, which aims to keep international cooperation in research and innovation both open and safe by managing risks and building resilience in the R&I sector across Europe.\nAgainst this background, proposals should contribute to conceptual clarity, definition of key concepts and the theoretical framework underpinning these concepts as well as gather evidence for policymaking, including through analysis of the threat landscape. Proposals should analyse the drivers for open strategic autonomy and economic security in various sectors of the European economy, notably the research, innovation and production domains, and map the relevant actors, trends, and risks.\nProposals are encouraged to analyse the correlation between the concepts of open strategic autonomy and economic security, including research security, considering the three pillars of the European Economic Security Strategy: promoting the EU’s competitiveness, protecting it from risks to economic security and collaborating with the widest range of countries that share the EU’s concerns or interests. Hence, proposals should develop recommendations on how to strike the right balance between being “as open as possible” and “as closed as necessary”, taking into consideration also what the implications of greater autonomy / technological sovereignty of the EU and its Member States would mean for economies and populations outside the EU, especially in developing countries.\nProposals are encouraged to assess the proportionality and effectiveness as well as the costs and benefits of policies and measures aiming at open strategic autonomy/technological sovereignty and economic security, including research security, and their implications for the research and innovation sector. This includes analysing interlinkages and tensions with concepts such as open science, academic freedom, research integrity and science diplomacy. Proposals should also analyse the risks and implications of individual Member States not adhering to EU strategic autonomy policies and explore the legal tools available to prevent and address such divergences.\nThere is a risk that open strategic autonomy ambitions do not consider negative impacts on developing countries, and might weaken multilateralism, cross-border trade, and foreign investment. Moreover, the open strategic autonomy policies could encourage the spread of protectionist policies globally, impacting particularly on developing countries. They could also unintentionally undermine Europe's position as a trade and development partner in developing countries. The latter could build ties with other global players, potentially increasing their dependence on them for resource extraction, trade, infrastructure development, and other key areas. Therefore, proposals should also consider what the implications of greater autonomy or sovereignty of the EU and its Member States would be for populations outside the EU, and how this could influence the engagement of professionals and organizations active in areas such as development cooperation, promotion of democracy and defence and promotion of human rights.\nProposals are encouraged also to investigate and gather evidence on what policies other international key partners develop in the areas of open strategic autonomy and economic security, including research security, and how these may impact the EU and is Member States. Ideas should be developed indicating how a level playing field in the cooperation with these key partners/geopolitical players could be guaranteed, ensuring that safeguarding measures do not hinder cooperation between partners.\nIn recent years, many Member States have developed foreign policy guidelines and strategies that incorporate feminist principles and the promotion of respect for minorities. These political developments, alongside academic debates, indicate a growing trend of integrating ethical and feminist principles into diplomatic strategies. Proposals are encouraged to consider such ethical and gender-responsive approaches to foreign policy and the design of open strategic autonomy. Research activities should involve a wide range of stakeholders and societal actors, including non-scientific and non-academic actors, such as public bodies, policymakers, private corporates, industry federations, media organisations, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, educational research bodies. Proposals under this call are encouraged to make use of participative methodologies and experimental methods.\nProposals should build on past EU-funded projects, and seek cooperation with on-going ones, addressing issues relating to strategic autonomy. Proposals should indicate which Horizon 2020 projects are considered sources of research results relevant to the activities to be carried out. Research activities could involve the analysis of Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI). Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "The phenomena of radicalisation, extremism, incitement to hatred and polarisation are a growing threat to democracy and social cohesion. In recent years, the EU has adopted several strategies to combat racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, as well as to counter hate speech and hate crimes. The EU also has policy tools to respond to all forms of extremism and radicalisation. As recalled by the Joint Communication “No Place for Hate” [1] of 6 December 2023, these initiatives are even more urgent considering the growth in hate speech and crimes against women and people belonging to vulnerable groups in recent years.\nSocial media amplifies radicalisation, extremism, hate speech, information manipulation and polarisation. Algorithm-driven personalisation restricts the public sphere and creates \"echo chambers\" where users primarily engage with like-minded views. This confirmation bias intensifies polarisation, fuels radicalisation, aids in recruiting extremists, and promotes hate speech and crime. Confirmation bias influences both social and traditional media users, as individuals seek information aligning with their beliefs. This trend impacts public discourse, fostering mis- and disinformation and information manipulation including conspiracy theories by limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and distorting perception of reality.\nThese phenomena arise from distortions in online interactions and media outlet characteristics, especially those that are mostly if not solely disseminated online. In certain member states, online media have become a primary information source alongside, or in the place of, traditional media channels (TV, radio, press), while lacking transparency regarding affiliations with interest groups or foreign influences. Moreover, radicalization and polarisation spread through social networks beyond social media. Therefore, proposals should also consider offline social networks, which include relationships like friendships, kinships, and shared interests, not solely reliant on online platforms.\nResearch activities should involve a wide range of stakeholders and potential end-users, including non-scientific and non-academic actors, such as, but not limited to, public bodies, media organisations and outlets, journalists, social media platforms, and representatives from other social networks, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, policymakers, educational bodies, other potential end-users of the research results. The involvement of one or more of these categories of stakeholders is required to test and uptake the research results and to explore their readiness to be implemented and replicated. More specifically, research activities are encouraged to involve private entities, such as providers of intermediaries’ services under the Digital Services Act (DSA), as their involvement is required to provide researchers with access to data necessary to undertake research and access to platform data on the spread and behaviour of disinformation online.\nProposals are encouraged to explore the following themes (among others): radicalisation and polarisation driven by stereotypes related to gender, religion, or ethnic minorities; the impact of new technologies on the production and dissemination of radicalisation and extremist content; the role of social cohesion, as both radicalisation and democratic participation are significantly influenced by the level of social cohesion within society; linkages between social and economic inequality and radicalisation, extremism, hatred and polarisation [2] .\nProposals are encouraged to include historical and comparative analysis, which is crucial for understanding the past uses of hate speech as well as contemporary efforts by radical and extremist organisations to shape narratives. By contextualising these dynamics, proposals can explore the evolution and impacts of these phenomena over time, providing insights into effective strategies for combating them.\nProposals should collaborate with the EU Knowledge Hub on radicalisation prevention (RAN – Radicalisation Awareness Network) to align priorities and share outcomes and should develop advisory services to its members.\nProposals are encouraged to seek collaboration whenever possible with relevant projects selected under previous EU-funded calls, such as HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-03 - Enhanced fight against the abuse of online gaming culture by extremists. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "The first-ever EU strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030) [1] is an ambitious and comprehensive strategy adopted by the European Commission on 5 October 2021. Generations after the end of the Shoah, antisemitism is worryingly on the rise, in Europe and beyond, especially since the turn of the 21st century [2] ￼. [3] ￼, the Commission calls \"for action, for all Europeans, to ensure that Europe is a place where our founding values are enjoyed by everyone, on an equal basis.” Antisemitism is incompatible with Europe’s core values. It represents a threat not only to Jewish communities and to Jewish life, but to an open and diverse society, to democracy and the European way of life. The European Union is determined to put an end to it.\nThe third pillar of the Strategy covers “Education, research and Holocaust remembrance” for a Europe that remembers its past and looks into the future through research and education. In this context, an independent expert report was commissioned in 2022 to assess the need to create a research hub on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life and deliver recommendations [4] .\nThe goal of this action is to establish a research hub in the shape of a network of researchers on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life in Europe, bringing together a critical mass of such actors in Europe, from Member States and Associated Countries representing the different parts of Europe. Such a hub should foster the research field’s identity and support training and career opportunities for researchers in the field, with a focus on early career researchers. Indeed, the hub’s primary objectives should be to help recruit, train and retain expert capacity in research on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life, and to help ensure that research generated by the field can be used to help formulate policy, at national and European levels.\nOne of the key expected outcomes is to prepare the sustainability of the hub. That includes exploring and eventually securing further regional, national and European funding, including (but not restricted to) a possible development into a permanent research infrastructure or European partnership. Proposals should demonstrate the capacity of the consortium to secure funding beyond the project’s lifetime.\nIn practical terms, the hub should be embedded within an appropriate existing research community– to help manage the practicalities of the work and to ensure optimal synergy with the field as it is currently constructed. It should provide opportunities for members to meet in person (in the shape of conferences, seminars, events etc) across geographical Europe. It should have a governance structure that includes an executive board comprised of leading research and policy specialists in the field, a permanent professional secretariat, and be supported by professionals in the areas of social research and policy, training, event management and communications. The hub should have a strong online presence to support its objectives, which should be focused on promoting the field and drawing in students, researchers and policymakers who have an interest in it.\nIn the long term (5 to 10 years), the hub is expected to contribute to stimulating interest in the field and attracting talents at all career stages. Among possible actions, it could oversee an internship programme for postgraduate researchers and/or start a summer school program. It is also encouraged that it builds a programme to help establish and distribute research grants for PhDs in contemporary antisemitism and in Jewish life, as well as smaller training grants for researchers at all levels to develop methodological, policy development and knowledge transfer expertise.\nFor more senior scholars, the hub is expected, also in the long term, to help create new academic positions focused exclusively on contemporary antisemitism and on specific aspects of European Jewish life (history, sociology, education, literary/media studies, demography, culture, heritage, etc.) and to provide the space for these position-holders to network together, in order to increase the impact of the research. In order to improve retention and growth in the field, the hub should establish (in the long term) at least one annual prize for an outstanding established scholar in the field and for an early career researcher, to help give prominence to the field and encourage new and existing research specialists. In addition, the hub could for instance, in the long term, work with major foundations operating in countering antisemitism and in fostering European Jewish life, promote initiatives that help make existing field research accessible to researchers and policymakers, and offer grants to Jewish community organisations in Europe to fund specific research projects.\nThe hub should act as an interface between research (including SSH disciplines) and policy. Consequently, it should organise at least one international conference gathering researchers, community leaders and policymakers. It is strongly encouraged to set up an annual conference that should continue running beyond the end of this action. In addition, it should publish annual reports summarizing the new research and research trends in the field in a format accessible and useful to policymakers.\nGiven the global dimension of antisemitism, international cooperation is encouraged.\nApplicants to this topic are encouraged to consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities domain, in particular EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure) [5] .\nGiven the level of ambition of the goals to be achieved, the project should have a minimum duration of 36 months.\n[1] Text of the strategy available here: https://op.europa.eu/s/zXwi .

      "scope": "In many parts of the world, democracies are under attack. Reports and indicators [1] confirm that we are in an ongoing wave of autocratisation, with the number of autocracies increasing steadily since around the turn of the century. Instead of the announced “end of history” through the triumph of the liberal democratic order, authoritarianism seems to have gained appeal while the democratisation wave rolls back. The ongoing invasion of a democratic European country by an authoritarian regime is just one token, and consequence, of the current autocratisation wave.\nHow does autocracy work in the twenty-first century? Why does authoritarianism continue to spread, not only as an alternative to, but also within liberal democracy, where populist leaders frequently deploy authoritarian tactics and practices, weakening and eroding the rule of law from the inside, while continuing to gain strength and popularity? The growing acceptance of autocratic approaches in well-functioning established democracies is an under-researched phenomenon, and therefore scientific knowledge and understanding of those tendencies could contribute to the development of tools to counteract them. Social and psychological aspects, as well as philosophical and historical dimensions, will need to be considered for such an analysis. Historical experiences with autocratic regimes can shed light on commonalities and differences, so that the lessons from the past underpin current analysis and responses.\nResistance against autocratisation requires also further investigation. While not overlooking structural pre-conditions, patterns of autocratisation, as well as the motivations and strategies used by authoritarian actors, the research to be funded should also look at the actors resisting autocratisation and their strategies, investigating the modalities, actors and patterns of resistance against processes of autocratisation, so as to generate updated and exploitable scientific knowledge on this field. Could media literacy, culture, creativity and arts, for instance, play a role in stemming autocratic tendencies [2] ? What role is left to LGBTIQ people and religious, migrant or ethnic minorities, usually targeted by autocrats and populist leaders, in the resistance playbook against autocracies? Could the heteronormative and whitewashing activities of autocracies, visible in different domains such as culture and arts, entertainment industry, tourism or sports, be also resisted and counteracted?\nParticularly striking, among those strategies to distract from persistent authoritarian practices, is the adoption of gender-equality reforms by some autocracies to boost their international image. While increased autocracy and anti-democratic tendencies go hand in hand with the global setback on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights, proposals should not overlook the causes and consequences of autocracies’ pursuit of gender equality. This will shed light on the overall patterns and drivers of autocracies in the twenty-first century.\nThe resistance against autocratisation tendencies has also moved into the digital realm, in order to counteract the “digital authoritarianism” [3] to which authoritarian and authoritarian-leaning leaders have resorted to. In the digital age, authoritarian power is built and sustained in transnational and globalized configurations that involve state and non-state actors, cutting across regime types. Via online censorship, internet shutdowns, digital surveillance and online disinformation and information manipulation, aspiring autocrats try to silence and disable access to information. Proposals should aim at disentangling the actor configurations engaged in digital authoritarian practices and investigate how these practices fit within the larger authoritarian playbook. In parallel, they should also focus on the challenges brought by resistance to digital authoritarianism, such as protests and investigative research and advocacy, enriching the analysis of the resistance playbook.\nProposals should investigate how to effectively protect democracies from autocratic tendencies and narratives. What means and strategies for protection are at the disposal of different stakeholders (public authorities, civil society organisations, media, citizens)? How can autocratic reforms be reversed and overcome without resorting to anti-democratic means (e.g. party bans, presidential executive orders, censoring) nor inducing large protests leading to increased polarisation?\nProposals could also look into the interrelations between the phenomena of science scepticism and science-denial, distrust in democracies and the autocratic appeal. Proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary, and actor-based, approach, integrating fields such as political science, law, sociology, philosophy, psychology, media and digital studies, gender studies, and history. Proposals should engage citizens, civil society organisations etc. in the development of their activities to ensure calibration and uptake.\nThe rise of autocracies and populisms in Europe is not an isolated phenomenon and needs to be looked at within a global context. Therefore, international cooperation is encouraged.\nProposals are encouraged to seek collaboration whenever possible with relevant projects selected under previous EU-funded calls, such as HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05, under Horizon Europe, or GOVERNANCE-03-2018, SU-GOVERNANCE-09-2020 and SU-GOVERNANCE-11-2018, under Horizon 2020. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\n[1] For instance, those from the annual Democracy Reports published by the Varieties of Democracy Institute.\n[2] The Annex to the Council Resolution on the EU Work Plan for Culture 2023-2026 (2022/C 466/01) states for instance that “cultural co-creation can authentically underpin and credibly communicate our European values, including artistic liberties and cultural rights, in large parts of the world, and thus help contain the reach of authoritarian systems.”\n[3] Understood as the practices that rely on digital technologies to prevent critical debate and accountability demands to powerholders by disrupting information flows and free expression and/or by using digital technologies to surveil citizens, activists, civil society organisations.",

      "scope": "Economic inequalities, encompassing wealth and income inequalities (e.g., in the form of money, financial assets, or real estate), pose a significant challenge to democratic societies. Over the past decades, while between-country inequality has generally decreased, within-country inequality has risen in numerous countries as global economic growth has not been evenly distributed. This widening gap in wealth has exacerbated political polarisation and fuelled distrust in democratic institutions worldwide. These trends not only suggest correlations between these phenomena but also threaten core democratic principles such as social justice, inclusion, and equal participation and representation. For instance, extremist parties often gain traction when governments fail to protect those disadvantaged by economic changes. Research indicates that governmental shortcomings in protecting those marginalised by structural economic shifts (e.g., cuts to social security entitlements, public investment and/or tax increase) fuel the roots of populism. Understanding this cycle and the complex relationship between economic inequality and democracy is key for a functioning democratic society. Proposals are encouraged to look at the efficiency and effectiveness of public policies in addressing inequalities. For instance, examining the gap between the design and implementation phases of policies aimed at reducing economic inequalities can help better understand their impact on democracy.\nHistorically, economic disparities have sometimes revitalised public participation and political engagement in various forms, such as trade unions, civic involvement, and political parties. This contrasts with contemporary trends where economic inequalities often correlate with disinterest or even rejection of democracy. Hence, there is a pressing need for SSH research to delve into why, how, and to what extent economic inequalities can undermine trust in democracy and broader societal structures, and how to counteract these trends. Proposals should consider diverse territorial contexts, moving beyond urban/rural dichotomies, and explore strategies to bolster democracies in these different contexts.\nMoreover, research has shown that economic inequalities, when assessed solely through economic indicators, fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of their impact on democracy. Citizens’ perceptions of economic inequalities appear to play a central role in shaping attitudes towards democratic processes and institutions. These perceptions are often exacerbated by dichotomies such as rich/poor, rural/urban, employed/unemployed, educated/uneducated, and native/immigrant. There is a lack of comparative work including citizens’ perceptions, particularly through an intersectional and intergenerational lens. Therefore, research proposals should consider perceived inequalities as an integral part of the research framework.\nKey research questions revolve around the intersection and impact of income and wealth inequalities on democratic practices. This involves exploring, for instance:\n- How do income and wealth inequalities across different geographic and territorial areas influence policy preferences of different social and age groups, notably political polarisation, voter turnout, and trust in democratic institutions and processes.\n- How perceived economic inequalities (in contrast to economic inequalities measured by quantitative indicators) influence trust and participation in democratic processes.\n- How do economic inequalities intersect with social class, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sex, gender, age, disability, and citizenship/nationality in different geographic areas, and what is the cumulative impact on democratic practices.\n- What role do local media and community networks play in shaping perceptions of economic inequality across different regions, and how do these perceptions impact democratic engagement.\n- How does geographic mobility (e.g., inter-city, rural-to-urban or vice-versa, national, international, temporary, permanent) influence the transmission of economic inequalities, and how do these processes affect participation and trust in democratic institutions.\n- What strategies could address varying levels of civic engagement among people and communities from different income brackets and levels of wealth.\nThe funded research should also generate knowledge on intergenerational transfers, that is, inheritances and inter-vivos gifts, (perceived) inequalities, and their impact on democracy: how do these intergenerational transfers influence wealth inequality, and thus, in line with the main subject of this call, how do they impact democracy, for instance in terms of participation or trust in institutions?\nWhen exploring economic inequalities, proposals should consider at least three additional intersecting dimensions of inequalities alongside economic ones, such as sex, gender, disability, social class, religion or belief, age, and racial or ethnic origins. For example, recent research across all EU Member States reveals that young men residing in regions marked by rising unemployment and perceived inequities in public institutions are inclined to view democratic principles like gender equality as challenges to their interests. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing how economic inequalities intersect with democratic values and social attitudes.\nProposals are encouraged to involve diverse disciplinary perspectives, including but not limited to economics, political economy, political science, public administration, history, (political) sociology, (social) psychology, gender studies, and public policy. Approaches that combine social science theories with data science techniques or incorporate novel mixed methodologies are encouraged.\nProposals should involve a diverse array of stakeholders across diverse demographic groups - encompassing different age groups, genders, minority communities, persons with disabilities, and socio-economically disadvantaged populations, including representatives from trade unions, civil society organisations, social welfare bodies, and (local) government representatives.\nApplicants to this topic are encouraged to make use of the data provided by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities domain, particularly CESSDA, the European Social Survey or SHARE. [1] Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nCooperation should be sought with the Community of democracy practitioners and researchers funded under HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-12. Moreover, proposals should build on the results of other EU projects, including the one funded under H2020-SC6-REV-INEQUAL-05-2016 - Inequalities in the EU and their consequences for democracy, social cohesion, and inclusion.\nIt is encouraged that proposals also exploit potential complementarities with projects funded under the following H2020 topics: REV-INEQUAL-07-2016: Spatial justice, social cohesion, and territorial inequalities; GOVERNANCE-04-2019 – Enhancing social rights and EU citizenship, and, under the following Horizon Europe topics: TRANSFORMATIONS-03-2018-2019: Innovative solutions for inclusive and sustainable urban environments; and TRANSFORMATIONS-22-2020: Enhancing access and uptake of education to reverse inequalities, as well as with Horizon Europe projects funded under HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-03: The impact of inequalities on democracy and HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-07: Intersectionality and equality in deliberative and participatory democratic spaces.\n[1] https://www.cessda.eu/ , https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/ and https://share-eric.eu/",

      "scope": "Mis- and disinformation and information manipulation can thwart political and societal responses to external challenges, such as climate change, public health, or migration. Solutions to such challenges, to be successful, must be based on evidence.\nFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right that involves the right to hold and express one's opinions, as well as the right to receive and impart information and ideas, without prior authorization (censorship) or other forms of interference from the government or any other form of public authority. Therefore, freedom of expression is crucial to democracy and a key value of the European project, and it is closely linked to the role of the independent (news) media, a key pillar for checks and balances in a democratic system [1] .\nProposals should investigate how the functioning of the media systems (in particular the data-driven information systems, that use data as a core component of their operation, decision-making processes, and overall functionality) favours disinformation, including gendered disinformation and anti LGBTIQ rhetoric, by creating an optimal environment for its creation, diffusion and proliferation.\nProposals are encouraged to look into the market incentives for media that promote mis- and disinformation and information manipulation, such as decline in viewers and incentives to focus on content that promotes engagement over factuality. This trend is driven by the need to catch audience attention in a competitive media landscape, which often prioritizes sensationalism and emotional reactions over accuracy.\nProposals should also explore how regulations aimed at countering disinformation can be conceived in compliance with citizens' fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression, and preserving independent and pluralistic news media.\nProposals should investigate how to develop a diverse and healthy online (news) media sphere, through the design and management of trust indicators and comparison between facts and opinions on social media platforms, browsers, and websites, to help citizens, particularly children and youth, distinguish content produced with journalistic standards from non-sourced content and opinions. Such investigation should consider existing initiatives such as browser plugins and journalism trust indicators and should be developed/tested with media organisations. Therefore, research activities should involve media organisations and/or media practitioners, as well as information spreaders (individuals or entities that actively disseminate information across various platforms and channels, such as influencers, among others), in consultation and piloting activities to develop theoretical models and policy recommendations. The involvement of one or more of these categories of stakeholders is particularly important to develop innovative methodologies and solutions to counter growing phenomena, such as astroturfing. Astroturfing misleads by impersonating grassroots support through fake accounts or paid actors, amplifying visibility and public influence of misleading media content. It undermines trust in genuine online exchanges, manipulates public opinion, and reinforces echo chambers. This misuse of digital platforms spreads disinformation, undermining online debate integrity.\nProposals are also encouraged to investigate the role of professional “mediators”, i.e. individuals and entities involved in the development, structuring, and dissemination of media content: journalists, editors, producers, and broadcasters. These “mediators” play an important role in understanding and filtering information before it reaches the public and are critical in developing narratives and shaping public discourse. Moreover, proposals are encouraged to investigate the role of \"media dissemination hubs”, which distribute information and influence public opinion and public discourse through news, entertainment, and other types of content (such as platforms similar to traditional media, newspapers, TV, radio, and digital channels, namely social media, news websites).\nProposals should develop policy recommendations and methodologies for how to define and provide legal safeguards for protecting open civic discourse in the face of, but not limited to, Holocaust denial, hate speech or incitement to violence.\nProposals should build on past EU-funded projects, and seek cooperation with on-going ones, as well as plan to exploit potential complementarities with project(s) funded under HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05 — Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue; HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-06: Media for democracy – democratic media; HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-07: Politics and the impact of online social networks and new media; HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nResearch activities should involve a wide range of stakeholders and societal actors, including non-scientific and non-academic ones, such as, but not limited to public bodies, policymakers, private corporates, media organisations, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, fact-checkers, educational bodies, education and security practitioners, libraries and other cultural heritage institutions. The latter, with their extensive collections - including newspaper archives and web archives from recent decades - can provide valuable historical insights and help study the evolution of disinformation practices over time. Proposals are encouraged to make use of participative methodologies and experimental methods.\nResearch activities should also involve entities which are signatories of the Code of Practice on Disinformation, and entities which are subject to the Digital Services Act (DSA) and to the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA).\nResearch activities could also involve signatories of the Code of Conduct on Disinformation, media companies, public and private broadcasters, online news platforms, and digital services object of the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), and other private entities, such as providers of intermediaries’ services under the Digital Services Act (DSA).\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Policymakers, education and training institutions, and educators have a better understanding of the impactful learning, teaching and assessment of citizenship education (underpinned by SSH research and evidence), including formal or formal and non-formal learning.\n- Policymakers, education and training institutions, and educators gain a sound understanding of the impact of citizenship education related formal or non-formal learning on young people’s (aged 15-29) civic and democratic engagement (through different forms of community and political engagement), including young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and considering gender-specific barriers and opportunities.\n- Policymakers, education and training institutions, and educators gain a sound understanding of effective collaborative mechanisms between different actors in formal and/or non-formal education sectors in delivering effective citizenship education.\n- Policymakers, education and training institutions, and educators are more aware of and can roll out competence-based, transformational (fostering critical thinking and personal development) and action-oriented (fostering active civic engagement and democratic participation) pedagogical approaches to citizenship education, including innovative learning methodologies.",
      "scope": "Education should equip young people with competences for their personal, social, professional as well as civic engagement and development, enabling them to contribute to our democracies, now and in the future, by shaping active, engaged and creative citizens who are aware of their shared values and able to improve their living environment, as recalled in the 2023 Council conclusions on the contribution of education and training to strengthening common European values and democratic citizenship [1] . In the current context of growing social concerns and political polarisation, as well as in some cases insufficient engagement of young people in democratic life, we need effective educational and training tools to increase and nurture civic engagement and democratic participation and trust in democratic processes. How can different types of citizenship education (including combining formal education with non-formal or informal learning) increase the level of democratic knowledge, and encourage young people to become more involved in their communities and in democratic decision-making?\nThis involves developing citizenship competence, in line with the 2018 Council Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning [2] , and includes, for example, building knowledge and understanding of the European common values, of citizens’ obligations and responsibilities, developing critical thinking in understanding main contemporary events and history, understanding of social and cultural diversities and how national identities contribute to the European identity, an ability and willingness to constructively communicate and engage with others in common or public interest and in decision-making, as well as supporting equality and diversity, culture of peace and non-violence.\nThe aim of this topic is twofold. First, to understand and enhance – through innovative methodologies tested and measured by successful projects – young people’s civic knowledge (understanding of democratic institutions and processes) and democratic citizenship attitudes, as well as their experiences, willingness, and opportunities to engage in their communities and participate in civic life, fostering a culture of dialogue, democratic debate, and tolerance. Second, to assess the effectiveness of the teaching methods used to promote civic knowledge, attitudes, and engagement, ensuring they contribute to the development of informed and active citizens.\nProposals are expected to consider learning in formal educational settings and can also examine non-formal educational settings (e.g. extra-curricular activities, community service projects, youth clubs etc.). While both formal and non-formal learning are relevant and interesting for the purpose of the topic, they are very different in nature, with some overlap, and would require different research methods and approaches, which can be costly. The focus of research should be on formal education, while research on non-formal education would bring an added value because of the interplay: whether and how formal education actors collaborate with non-formal education actors, for example.\nProposals should address both young people from disadvantaged and from non-disadvantaged backgrounds and should also consider the gendered aspects of young people’s engagement, looking at the different barriers and opportunities for young women and men. Proposals should cover ages 15 to 29.\nProposals should also address the following aspects:\n- Design, pilot and test methodologies in formal learning, or in formal and non-formal learning, such as pedagogical approaches on transformational and action-oriented learning, aimed at helping to create critically engaged participants in society, civic learning opportunities, measures related to open classroom climate or student co-creation of education institution related policies and processes (democracy-in-action learning environments). Proposals are encouraged to use mixed methods approaches combining qualitative and quantitative (e.g. small, randomized control trials to test the effectiveness of specific interventions) methods. They may include methodologies for direct youth participation in decisions that concern them, for example in school, sport, cultural activities, public space, any policies in the remit of local administrations. Proposals are expected to pilot innovative methodologies, and not simply to test existing protocols. They are encouraged to include young people in the design of these innovative methodologies and may develop digital gamified pedagogical tools.\n- Produce step-by-step explanations for education and training institutions, educators, national education authorities, and policymakers to roll out innovative methodologies in formal and possibly also non-formal learning, designed to create positive effects on levels of civic engagement, a culture of democratic debate, tolerance, and understanding of democratic institutions and processes. To help improve the supply and quality of democratic citizenship education, proposals are expected to develop guidelines on methodology, content and teacher training, a toolbox of pedagogical materials for teachers, and assessment tools to help identify implementation gaps.\nThe proposed research should also examine what educational tools and approaches need to be in place in formal, or formal and non-formal education, to equip young people for constructive participation in democratic decision-making, understanding of social and cultural diversity, readiness to support inclusive societies, and peaceful conflict resolution. Proposals may also devise (and run) ways to measure the extent to which extending the right to vote to young people aged 16 and 17 has increased their political participation (e.g. voting in elections), and what specific awareness-raising educational accompanying measures were put in place, in those countries where such measures have recently been put in place, focusing on the varying effects across different genders and intersectional demographics.\nProposals may also study where existing models and practices of civic and citizenship education may have failed (could have a negative impact or are simply insufficient) and led to a paucity of civic engagement, and a culture of polarisation rather than debate. This could include, for example, an analysis of large-scale assessments of young people's knowledge and understanding of concepts and issues related to civics and citizenship, in order to build on previous findings in the tested methodologies.\nFor their contributions to the outcomes of this topic to be successful, applicants must include in their consortia public authorities with the capacity to roll out curricula or institutions in charge of teacher education and training, and/or education and training institutions, in order to better understand the realities faced by those with the capacity to implement the project’s findings and design adapted pilots and methodologies, and to facilitate the roll-out of the methodologies successfully tested by the project. There must also be active engagement of civil society in projects as partners, e.g. youth clubs, sports clubs, community projects, or arts and culture organisations. Testing and innovation work packages should be led or co-led by public authorities with the authority to roll out curricula or education methodologies, and/or education and training institutions, and/or educators in formal and non-formal learning.\nProposals should detail how they will develop close involvement of education bodies and practitioners in the field of democracy promotion, and in particular those involved in relevant projects that received support from other EU programmes, e.g. Erasmus+, European Solidarity Corps, CERV, or Global Europe. Proposals should explain how they will establish connections, find synergies, and build on the work of projects funded under previous Horizon Europe Calls as, for instance:\nHORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-04: Education for democracy; HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-08: Culture, the arts, and cultural spaces for democratic participation and political expression, online and offline; HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-02-01: Network for innovative solutions for the future of democracy; HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-03: The impact of inequalities on democracy; HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-08: Representative democracy in flux; and HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-02: The future of democracy and civic participation.\n[1] Council conclusions on the contribution of education and training to strengthening common European values and democratic citizenship\n[2] Council Recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning",

      "scope": "Judicial independence is a principle of EU law, closely linked to the rule of law, the right to a fair trial and effective judicial protection, as guaranteed by the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.\nThe EU already benefits from several tools to ensure the respect of the rule of law. These instruments serve to promote the rule of law, prevent rule of law problems from emerging, and respond to them when they materialize.\nOn the preventive side, one of the tools is the annual EU Justice Scoreboard which has been providing comparable data on the independence, quality, and efficiency of national justice systems since 2013. In addition, the annual European Rule of Law Mechanism, with the annual Rule of Law Report at its centre, has been providing since 2020 a qualitative assessment of significant developments in the areas of justice, anti-corruption, media independence and institutional checks and balances in every Member State [1] , including specific recommendations for all Member States, aiming to prevent challenges to the rule of law from emerging or deepening.\nGaining a better understanding on the implementation of international and EU standards and its impact on judicial independence is crucial to support the EU's capacity to proactively promote rule of law, fundamental human rights, and democracy.\nReflecting on reform activities at national level and the complexity of national justice systems, proposals should contribute to improve the understanding of the functioning of the safeguards for judicial independence in each other's justice systems. This can be achieved with a multidisciplinary research approach (including research in SSH disciplines), complementing the data and analysis gathered through the annual EU Justice Scoreboard and annual Rule of Law Report.\nWhile using a multidisciplinary approach such as a socio-legal approach, proposals should compare and critically assess national frameworks for judicial independence. Special focus should be put on how national rules, covering e.g. the procedure regarding appointments, promotion and dismissals of judges and members of judicial administration bodies, workload assessment of judges, allocation of cases, disciplinary proceedings, and transfers of judges, work in practice.\nProposals should also contribute to building concrete knowledge on current legal practice, the statutory framework, leading court cases and major relevant developments at national level with up to date, reliable and comparable information in the Member states and in the enlargement countries.\nAdditionally, a comparative analysis on the independence, impartiality and integrity of judicial institutions across the EU could serve as a case to illustrate the rights to an effective remedy and fair trial, and also to strengthen accountability in the broad sense.\nTo support this goal, proposals should provide an outline for a comparative analysis of the safeguards for judicial independence in the Member States and, where appropriate, enlargement countries. Proposals should also highlight good practices on the implementation of international and EU rules and standards at national level.\nBased on the research on the implementation of international and EU rules and standards at national level, policy recommendations could be developed to reflect on how judicial cooperation between the Member States could be strengthened.\nProposals are encouraged to network with and build on previously funded projects under the Horizon Europe [2] , Horizon 2020 or other EU programmes, e.g. Citizen, Equality, Rights and Values, and the Internal Security Fund (ISF) [3] . Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\n[1] Since 2024, the Rule of Law Report has also been covering selected candidate countries.\n[2] In particular the projects funded under HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-03: What is the long-term impact of rule of law and other European values on socio-economic outcomes.\n[3] Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme - European Commission (europa.eu) and Internal Security Fund - European Commission (europa.eu)",

The goal of this current call topic is to strengthen, augment, and pursue the work of the network [3] of researchers in democracy together with practitioners of civic participation and deliberation and of citizenship education across Europe, previously set up. This network should contribute to the EU’s future policy to strengthen and renew democracy.\nThe selected proposal will establish an innovative successor network of democracy research organisations and practitioners of democratic innovation, which will:\n- Produce policy recommendations to strengthen and renew democracy in all governance levels and democratic debate in Member States and Associated Countries, drawing on the existing body of knowledge. These recommendations must be accessible, publicly available, and well disseminated including through a central open access repository.\n- Help policymakers in the EU and Associated Countries to design civic participation strategies for relevant policy areas, in conjunction with the European Commission’s Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy [4] as relevant.\n- Organise 2 retreats per year for policymakers from EU Member States, Associated Countries and EU institutions, targeting high-level officials, to learn and exchange from experts and peers on democratic strengthening and renewal, and encourage exchange on emerging or persisting challenges and threats to democracy, participation, and civic engagement.\n- Design capacity building activities on inclusive participatory and deliberative forms of democracy at different governance levels, including training and knowledge sharing.\n- Organise at least one conference on democratic innovations gathering researchers, practitioners, education bodies and EU and national policymakers.\nProposals should establish links to and seek complementarities with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe (such as the network established under HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-12 [5] ) or synergies with the Citizens Equalities Rights and Values programme (CERV) [6] .

      "scope": "This topic aims at implementing real use cases and carrying out demanding end-to-end testing of the platform and its tools, in order to verify its capabilities and improve the ECCCH.\nThe activities carried out should focus on concrete use cases, undertaken by the participating institutions, professionals and researchers with a view to improve their results or work processes.\nThe activities carried out should make use of several of the key features of the ECCCH, including the user tools implemented on it [1] . Such key features may include use of the advanced digital twins, of the large-scale cooperation and co-creation features, of the digital continuum or of the advanced features for commercial cooperation with, for example, cultural and creative industries [2] . Activities carried out may also focus on the seamless interconnection of the ECCCH with other related platforms such as the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and the European Open Science Cloud. Proposals should outline a focus of the planned activities that best achieve the expected outcomes, which may include some of the aspects mentioned.\nActivities should involve a wide range of different organisations from across Europe, in accordance with the focus chosen. Entities from at least five different Member States or Associated Countries should be involved as active users of the ECCCH platform. Also, entities of different characteristics should be involved, such as small and large organisations, from different subsectors/areas of activity or scientific disciplines, etc.\nThe activities carried out and the results generated should be properly documented so as to serve as a good base for improvements or corrections of the platform and/or of the user tools implemented on it, and also for communicating innovative uses of the ECCCH. Contributions should be made to extend the user base of the ECCCH by promoting use cases and outreach activities, possibly together with or coordinated with other ECCCH projects.\nProjects funded under this topic may build on testing or other activities carried out by other ECCCH projects, but must not duplicate activities that are funded under other ECCCH projects. Activities should add new value to the ECCCH. Therefore, projects funded under this topic should coordinate closely with previously funded ECCCH projects and provide for sufficient flexibility so as to avoid duplication and ensure that the activities carried out offer important contributions to validate and improve the platform.\nProposals should foresee own capacity to implement important improvements and fix problems detected. Such modifications or extensions of the ECCCH platform functionality should be carried out in accordance with the data model and the software development and documentation guidelines of the ECCCH, established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01 [3] . All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01, and should be implemented in compliance with the design of the ECCCH, using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.\nAll software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open-source licence as recommended by the Free Software Foundation [4] and the Open-Source Initiative [5] . If the use of open source software components would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, proprietary components may be used provided that: An open functional replacement is available; they do not introduce proprietary data formats or Application Programming Interfaces; a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH and all its users. Applicants should state clearly if all developed software will be open source, and if not clearly explain the reasons.\nTo the extent that data is produced, efforts should be made to ensure that it is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). To the extent that new or modified interoperability standards need to be developed for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, these should build on the FAIR data principles and leverage already adopted practices, especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research Infrastructures.\nFinancial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with ECCCH users beyond the project consortium. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.\nIn order to ensure good coordination among the different ECCCH projects, proposals should make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. Projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with the relevant projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at proposal stage.\nProjects funded under this topic should set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.\nThe Commission expects the different projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning, as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes, where this is appropriate.\nThe Commission estimates that a project duration of approximately 2 – 2.5 years is appropriate for the projects funded under this topic.\nPlease also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.\n[1] For an orientation of the range of user tools being developed, please refer to the previous ECCCH call topics in the Horizon Europe Cluster 2 Work Programmes 2023 and 2024.\n[2] The key features of the ECCCH are further explained in the Destination introduction text and in the ‘Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage - Ex – ante impact assessment’ available here:\nhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/90f1ee85-ca88-11ec-b6f4-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[3] See further https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101157364\n[4] https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicense\n[5] https://opensource.org/licenses",

      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to at least three of the following expected outcomes:\n- Policy makers, Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) [1] and other stakeholders gain insights into the impact of AI, including, but not limited to, generative AI, on artists, creatives, cultural professionals, creative businesses and on the market for cultural and creative goods and services, as well as on the future of creative work.\n- Policy makers, research (including SSH disciplines), education, industry, and society benefit from robust, evidence-based policy recommendations and concrete solutions promoting a mutually beneficial interplay between CCI and AI. These policy recommendations and solutions aim for a fairer marketplace that fosters transparency, fairness, non-discrimination, diversity, and accountability by design, while respecting artistic freedom.\n- Policy makers, the CCI, and stakeholders are provided with case studies and evidence-based policy recommendations to harness the CCI’ potential for AI innovation and promote human-centric, unbiased AI applications.\n- Frameworks, protocols, and tools for managing intellectual property and personality rights in AI development, training, and use, addressing unauthorised data use and legal breaches, are available to CCI and public authorities.\n- Mechanisms or platforms, such as CCI-led competence centres or hubs, are proposed to facilitate interaction among artists, creatives, AI specialists, cultural institutions, and creative businesses. These will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experiences on AI-powered innovations and aim to develop new solutions that serve the needs of the CCI and society at large, ultimately enhancing creativity-driven innovation.",
      "scope": "The rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence are increasingly permeating and transforming economy and society, notably impacting the diverse and dynamic domains of the CCI which, notably, are predominantly composed of SMEs. This transformation offers significant opportunities for innovation, within the CCI and in the economy and society at large, and poses challenges including bias, ethical dilemmas, employment shifts, skills need, and issues related to data access, transparency, preservation of cultural diversity and respect for creators’ rights.\nTo foster a culture- and creativity-driven European innovation ecosystem, it’s crucial to understand and address these impacts, build capacity to steer development, anticipate consequences, and prepare the CCI with the necessary skills to thrive in the new scenario. Enhancing the capabilities of the CCI in this rapidly evolving landscape increases innovation potential at the intersection of technology, arts, culture, and society.\nInitiatives at the crossroads between art, technology, science, and society, such as the EU’s STARTS – Science, Technology, and the Arts – demonstrate the advantages of involving artists and creative professionals to advance innovation and develop technologies that resonate with individuals and reflect cultural diversity. Artistic skills like intuition, imagination, and creativity, which are challenging for AI to replicate, along with expertise in design, visualisation, storytelling, to mention just a few, provide fresh ideas and unique insights for creating human-centric AI tools that address specific challenges and are designed to be ethical, sustainable, trustworthy, culturally sensitive and enhance user experience.\nTo address the multifaceted intertwining between AI and the CCI, and to foster a sustainable, innovative environment, the following areas could contribute to this topic’s expected outcomes:\n- Explore the impact of AI - including generative AI, and emerging AI systems - on CCI markets and audiences, ranging from individual artists and creators to processes, services, products, and consumer interactions.\n- Investigate AI’s current and potential applications within CCI that enhance creativity, innovation, and competitiveness.\n- Focus on AI integration in those cultural and creative industries where it is most disruptive or most needed to optimise processes and reap business opportunities, identifying key risks, changes in employment and job profiles, and the need for upskilling, reskilling, and capacity building.\n- Develop a sound understanding of how the intersection of CCI and AI can drive innovation both within the CCI and across other sectors, promoting business processes that respect and promote cultural diversity, foster the discoverability of European content and protect and reward human creativity.\n- Investigate the underexplored potential of creativity and the arts to engage with AI developments and collaborate with AI specialists and third parties when appropriate. This can aim to design trustworthy, ethical, user-friendly intelligent systems that meet people's needs, enhance user experience, safeguard cultural diversity, address biases (including biases towards gender, sex, age, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, and migrant status) boost CCI’s competitiveness, and promote societal adoption of AI.\n- Develop pilots, guidance, and innovative toolkits, including use cases, checklists, and algorithms, addressing CCI needs and values, cultural diversity, and the protection of intellectual property rights, including copyright and related rights.\n- Facilitate interaction among artists and creatives, AI developers, cultural institutions, creative businesses, and third parties as appropriate, to promote knowledge transfer and enhance AI-powered innovation in CCI.\n- Provide mechanisms or platforms for collaborations, peer learning, and knowledge sharing to build capacity and foster creativity-led innovation, while integrating humanistic perspectives into AI through dialogues that blend creativity and the arts with AI communities within research, policy, and practice.\n- Assess the role cultural organisations can play in training AI systems in their areas of competence to represent multilingualism and cultural diversity in digital environments and to foster accessibility, and the extent to which AI contributes to their value creation, enhancing traditional methods and practices and personalising engagement with their public.\n- Devise strategic recommendations for policies and practices that foster a mutually beneficial relationship between AI and CCI, propose fair rights management solutions and address employment, skills, and innovation challenges.\nProposals should involve from the outset representatives from the CCI, including the arts and cultural heritage, to ensure their central role in activity development. Proposals need not cover all CCI but may focus on a specific area for thorough analysis to develop a strong knowledge base and highlight strategic directions and routes to improvement.\nProposals should, to the extent appropriate, build on existing knowledge, activities, and networks, especially those funded by the European Union. They should seek complementarities with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe Clusters 2 and 4 [2] and explore synergies with projects dealing with AI and the cultural and creative sectors and industries, funded by other EU programmes like Creative Europe, and Digital Europe. [3]\n[1] “Cultural and creative industries are those industries that are based on cultural values, cultural diversity, individual and/or collective creativity, skills and talent with the potential to generate innovation, wealth and jobs through the creation of social and economic value, in particular from intellectual property; they include the following sectors relying on cultural and creative inputs: architecture, archives and libraries, artistic crafts, audiovisual (including film, television, software and video games, and multimedia and recorded music), cultural heritage, design, creativity-driven high-end industries and fashion, festivals, live music, performing arts, books and publishing (newspapers and magazines), radio and visual arts, and advertising” European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2016 on a coherent EU policy for cultural and creative industries (2016/2072(INI))\n[2] For example: HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-03: Leverage the digital transition for competitive European cultural and creative industries; HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-02: Cultural and creative industries for a sustainable climate transition; HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-24 - Tackling gender, race and other biases in AI.\n[3] Proposals can leverage the data and services available through the research infrastructures included in the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) and the ESFRI roadmap and those federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces, including the common European data space for cultural heritage. They could also explore digital infrastructures, including the Alliance for Language Technologies European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (ALT-EDIC).

      "scope": "As technology improves, attractive content is developed and virtual worlds become more accessible, European citizens will spend ever more time and experience an ever larger share of important life events in virtual and blended environments. Leading multinational companies as well as the European Union are making great efforts to accelerate this development, whereby it is the ambition of the European Union to create a thriving and world-leading European industrial ecosystem for virtual worlds [3] .\nAs life thus becomes ever more virtualised, in the long term this will inevitably lead to drastic changes in perceptions, beliefs, behaviours and values. Culture will evolve; possibly new elements of culture will be born while old ones disappear. Creativity, cultural production and access to culture will have an ever-greater virtual component, changing the playing field for cultural heritage institutions as well as for cultural and creative industries. European creators will have new ways to create, promote and disseminate European cultural content and engage widely with new audiences.\nThe development towards virtualisation of life is not entirely new. For instance, gaming communities exist since many years, where members spend large parts of their lives online, and where virtual economic and social ecosystems can be said to have evolved. However, the scale and breadth of the virtualisation of most aspects of human life that is to come will have cultural impacts many orders of magnitude stronger than has been experienced thus far.\nIt is therefore of great importance to deepen our knowledge and understanding of the long-term effects on culture when people spend ever more time in virtual and blended environments - for work, entertainment, playing, studying, socialising, etc. Research should explore both benefits and risks in depth, based on a thorough understanding of what is realistically possible and probable in a long-term perspective. Key opportunities and threats should be identified in relation to the EU’s ambition to strengthen human wellbeing, sense of purpose and agency, as well as social cohesion, resilience and growth.\nBased on research findings and scientific knowledge, projects should furthermore develop measures that would help realise the opportunities of cultural evolution in virtual and blended worlds, and mitigate the most important threats. Projects should, to the extent reasonably possible, make sure that findings and proposed measures are valid and feasible across the cultural diversity of Europe.\nProposals are not expected to address all aspects of the virtualisation of life, but should choose a focus that has the potential to bring decisive benefits, and should make sure to analyse these areas with sufficient depth to create a solid knowledge base.\nProposals should, to the extent appropriate, build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. In particular, projects may want to establish links to the future European Partnership on Virtual Worlds, and may want to build on findings developed by relevant past and/or ongoing Horizon Europe projects [4] .\n[1] In the context of this topic, ‘culture’ should be understood in a holistic sense, along the definition proposed by UNESCO in 2001: “the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group, that encompasses, not only art and literature but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs”\n[2] In the context of this topic, ‘virtual worlds’ should be understood as persistent, immersive environments, based on technologies including 3D and extended reality, which make it possible to blend physical and digital worlds in real time, in line with the Communication COM(2023) 442 ‘An EU initiative on Web 4.0 and virtual worlds: a head start in the next technological transition’\n[3] See for instance the above mentioned COM(2023) 442 ‘An EU initiative on Web 4.0 and virtual worlds: a head start in the next technological transition’\n[4] Such as project ‘OPENVERSE’: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135701",

      "scope": "Innovation and competitiveness are driven to an ever-greater degree by cultural dimensions and creativity. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be not only functional but also appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural traits and market needs.\nThe process of creating or adapting products, services, processes or business models to human needs and desires, commonly called design, is key not only for competitiveness but also for environmental sustainability and cultural affirmation. It is widely acknowledged that the environmental impact of a product is largely determined at the design stage. The same also holds for digital products or services.\nBuilding on Europe’s world-renowned cultural heritage, well-educated and talented workforce, craftmanship and strong creative traditions, European design is in many ways considered world leading. Large parts of the European economy rely on top-notch design for competitiveness, such as for instance luxury and high-end goods, fashion or the automotive industry. It is estimated that design-intensive industries employ around 27 million persons in the EU, representing around 13% of total employment and more than 15% of GDP [3] .\nDespite its outsize importance for future prosperity and societal and planetary wellbeing, design and its role in driving innovation and competitiveness have not been sufficiently researched. While being one of Europe’s key competitive strengths, the European design sector and design professionals are structurally vulnerable and face a challenging pace of drastic changes. For instance, ever more powerful ‘generative artificial intelligence’ tools become capable of automating tasks previously requiring high levels of skills, while challenging new expectations in terms of reducing the environmental impact of products and services are added.\nThe challenge is to deepen evidence-based understanding of the European design sector and design professionals, and devise effective methods to strengthen the sector and make Europe a global powerhouse of design for sustainable competitiveness. Such methods may include new or adapted technological solutions, conceptual frameworks as well as innovative business models [4] and policies. The proposed solutions should to the extent possible be effective as well as economically and politically feasible and culturally acceptable across the diversity of EU member states and associated countries, as well as across different economic sectors. Thus, a wide range of stakeholders should be involved, in accordance with the focus chosen.\nProposals are not expected to address all aspects, subsectors or applications of design, but should choose a focus that can be expected to deliver a significant impact.\nSolutions may involve the use of platforms or networks to facilitate sharing investments, facilities or competencies among actors. In such cases, established platforms, networks or clusters should be taken into account, to avoid duplication of efforts.\nProposals should, to the extent appropriate, build on existing knowledge [5] , activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. In particular, findings and results from projects funded under the topics ‘Cultural and creative industries for a sustainable climate transition’ of the 2023 and 2024 calls of Horizon Europe Cluster 2 may be taken into consideration, and cooperation may be sought with the collaborative platform ‘EKIP’ [6] or its successor.\n[1] In the context of this topic, ‘design’ should be understood as the process of devising or adapting products, services or organisational and business models to the needs and desires of humans.As a reference, applicants may also refer to the scope of specialised design activities and professions as identified by Eurostat under the NACE classification Revision 2.1 (Regulation 2023/137)\n[2] Sustainable competitiveness builds on productivity growth, environmental sustainability, macroeconomic stability and fairness. See for instance COM(2023) 168 final ‘Long-term competitiveness of the EU: looking beyond 2030’\n[3] See for instance European Union Intellectual Property Office, Report ‘Women in Design’ (April 2023).\n[4] Such innovative business models may be based on ‘circular economy’ principles and design for circularity.\n[5] For instance the work of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) working group of Member States experts on “Stimulating the green transition of cultural and creative sectors” might be relevant.\n[6] See further https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112111",

      "scope": "Rapidly evolving geopolitical dynamics place the EU amid escalating conflicts and emergent crises, requiring an innovative approach to security frameworks, foreign policy, and peacebuilding strategies. R&I actions can develop groundbreaking solutions for the future, fostering innovative approaches to security and foreign policy. Integrating culture, including cultural heritage and the arts, into these frameworks could contribute to long term peace and stability by preserving community identity and history, enhancing communities’ preparedness to crises, facilitating dialogue, reconstructive learning, reconciliation, and social cohesion. International cultural relations need to adapt to contemporary and future challenges by leveraging innovative strategic approaches to culture to facilitate dialogue, promote mutual understanding, and address socio-cultural disparities fuelling conflicts. The arts and culture offer unique avenues for expression, communication, and trust, transcending socio-political barriers and fostering non-violent strategies for social change, while supporting the preparedness of citizens in case of major disruptions.\nAddressing the innovative role of culture in conflict prevention, security, preparedness, resilience, and post conflict reconciliation calls for a fully interdisciplinary approach, drawing from a rich variety of disciplines.\nSince 2016, the EU has established a policy framework for international cultural relations heading towards a comprehensive strategy [1] and initiating pilot projects, preparatory actions, and flagship initiatives alongside numerous ground projects. The European External Action Service Concept and the Council Conclusions on the EU approach to cultural heritage in conflicts and crises (2021) emphasize integrating cultural heritage protection into broader security and peacebuilding frameworks. Proposals should map relevant actions and initiatives led by European institutions, international organisations, individual States, and civil society organisations in Member States and Associated Countries, including those from partnerships in international cultural relations. Analysing these initiatives will build an empirical knowledge base, serving as models and inspiration, and provide insights into different approaches under various circumstances, enhancing understanding of what works best for specific purposes, as well as identifying gaps.\nTo pursue the expected outcomes, proposals might, by way of example:\n- Identify successful approaches to integrating cultural heritage as a strategic asset into foreign policy and security frameworks. Explore the potential of cultural heritage as common ground for conflicting parties, contributing to social fabric reconstruction and long-term stability in conflict-affected regions. Examine intangible cultural heritage and traditional knowledge as sources for peacebuilding strategies, fostering people-to-people connectivity, cooperation, and trust.\n- Explore strategies and approaches at the intersection of art and culture, emergency management, and community resilience, with a view to increase preparedness before, during and after crises.\n- Collect and analyse case studies of peacebuilding initiatives involving cultural and creative expressions and the arts, including bottom-up practices.\n- Analyse current policies to identify gaps and opportunities for integrating culture and peacebuilding into security and development frameworks. Develop policy guidelines and frameworks to help policymakers incorporate cultural strategies into peacekeeping, security and social development agendas.\n- Explore digital technologies for enhancing cultural exchange and dialogue in peacebuilding. Explore the imaginaries, narratives, and metaphors currently prevalent in the AI sector, and consider how the development of AI systems could be enhanced to better support cultural diversity, intercultural understanding, and ‘digital humanism’ to promote peace, safety, and fairness.\n- Develop metrics for evaluating the impact of cultural initiatives on peacebuilding, preparedness, and conflict resolution. Conduct empirical studies to measure long-term benefits of these programmes on economic stability, social cohesion, and well-being in conflict-affected areas.\n- Investigate how culture can be manipulated, instrumentalised and exploited to provoke conflict, including the tactical use of cultural identity and cultural appropriation to incite tensions. Investigate how cultural heritage of troubled pasts can be approached, providing new insights on how co-existence narratives of the past can contribute to reconciliation, reconstructive learning, and mutual understanding. In this respect, complementarities with topic HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-08 might be sought.\n- Collect and analyse good practices related to leveraging cultural heritage, culture, and creativity to address societal challenges such as fragmentation, polarisation, rising extremism, migration, the refugee crisis, and regional and local tensions.\n- Investigate how intersectional factors such as gender, age, citizenship, and socioeconomic status affect participation in and outcomes of cultural peacebuilding initiatives. Assess the differential impacts on various demographic groups and develop strategies for inclusivity. Evaluate the role of cultural institutions and practices in restorative and transformative justice.\n- Conduct longitudinal studies to assess long-term effects of cultural interventions on community resilience, social cohesion, and economic recovery in post-conflict regions. Identify key determinants of sustainability of cultural peacebuilding efforts and consolidate understanding of how to sustain peace once achieved.\n- Investigate the link between culture, cultural heritage, and sustainable economy, examining their effects on post-conflict recovery, reconstruction and sustainable peace. Conflicts damage local economies, leading to exploitation of natural and cultural heritage for sustenance.

      "scope": "Europe's rich heritage includes numerous objects, documents in libraries, museums, and archives, but also sites and cultural landscapes that recall complex and often troubled pasts. These heritage assets, often contested and frequently neglected or at risk of deterioration or abandonment, pose significant challenges for preservation, conservation, interpretation, and engagement. Gaining a better understanding of the dissonance and contestation surrounding cultural heritage assets is crucial not only for safeguarding memory and heritage but also for fostering historical understanding, cultural dialogue, and reconciliation on persisting dissonances.\nProposals should explore the multiple perspectives on troubled pasts and their impact on cultural heritage, with a focus on heritage assets connected to colonial, totalitarian and authoritarian regimes which may be linked biased or discriminatory beliefs. By engaging with such complex and often painful legacies, proposals should contribute to a broader reflection on participatory approaches in cultural heritage governance. Proposals are also encouraged to adopt a gendered and intersectional approach to advance gender equality and build more inclusive societies. Furthermore, the interplay between culture and nature in managing cultural landscapes is also crucial, requiring a balance between human and environmental values to ensure sustainable preservation.\nProposals should establish a collaborative and multidisciplinary network of professionals. It could rely on expertise from given disciplines and fields, such as: anthropology, history, heritage science (focused on conservation and exhibition and museum curation), media and intercultural communication, political science and science education. Researchers and experts with thematic expertise in the field(s) of memory studies, war and conflict, decolonisation, post-totalitarian regimes, and/or intersectionality could bring an added value. The integration of cultural and creative industries and local authorities could contribute to ensure the real-world applications of this research network.\nThis collaborative network should develop a comprehensive Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for the preservation, conservation, transmission, and adaptive reuse of contested and dissonant heritage across Europe. This agenda should identify trends, clear drivers, gaps and opportunities to highlight the added value of complementary research activities or initiatives in this field. The proposed consortium should have an active role in promoting critical dialogues on remaining controversies and their lasting impacts on contemporary societies. Proposals should provide an assessment offering policy recommendations for the documentation, revitalisation (such as better understanding preservation, restoration, transmission, and transformation) and adaptive reuse of dissonant and contested heritage assets to preserve historical and cultural values. The recommendations should support public administrations, particularly local authorities, and the Cultural and Creative Industries in managing contested heritage and engaging with local community.\nProposals should shape recommendations to leverage contested objects, documents, sites and cultural landscapes for educational and cultural tourism purposes, ensuring historical understanding, cultural dialogue, and reconciliation. To address the challenges posed by these heritage assets, proposals should integrate innovative approaches that prioritize sustainability and preservation for future generations.\nProposals could aim to develop educational programmes to target various audiences, including young people, local communities, and international tourists to ensure the engagement of future generations in tackling complex historical challenges. Pilot programmes could be implemented to assess the effectiveness of these tools and recommendations. Public bodies with an interest in supporting the long-term sustainable use of these educational tools could be involved in these efforts.\nRecommendations for the integration of contested and dissonant heritage assets into sustainable tourism practices that respect their sensitive nature and contribute to the sustainable development of local communities, is another aspect that should be considered in the strategic agenda. Utilizing existing digital tools and platforms to promote virtual tours, augmented reality experiences, and interactive educational content, making these heritage assets accessible to a broader audience and enhancing visitor experience could be considered as an added value.\nWhile shaping the above-mentioned Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the proposal should identify key EU-funded projects contributing to this research area and suggest how to strengthen collaboration and networking in this field. It could also use results from existing evidence-based research, including insights from EU-funded projects. For that purpose, proposals are encouraged to network with and build on previously funded projects under Horizon Europe, in particular HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-04 Cultural heritage in transformation – facing change with confidence calls, HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-04 Europe’s cultural heritage and arts – promoting our values at home and abroad, Horizon 2020 or other EU programmes, e.g. Global Europe [2] as appropriate.

      "scope": "An Open Method of Coordination expert group is working on culture and health in 2024, building on the preparatory action “Bottom-up Policy Development for Culture & Well-being in the EU [1] ” (2022-23)\nThere has been a major increase of research into the effects of culture and the arts on health and well-being [2] , alongside developments in practice and policy activities in different EU countries. A recent example is the covid-19 pandemic, which challenged individual and collective wellbeing in an unprecedented manner. Its consequences – particularly in terms of mental health – have been felt long after the conclusion of the crisis in medical and public health terms. The covid-19 pandemic has showed that culture may play a profound and fundamental role in our lives. Moreover, the war of aggression against Ukraine has recalled the importance of culture and arts for the mental health of forcibly displaced people.\nThe Commission Communication “A comprehensive approach to mental health” recognized the contribution of culture to mental health and well-being of individuals and society, for example through culture-based social prescribing and the fight against stigma. The EU Work Plan for Culture 2023-2026 recognises that “cultural activities have a positive impact on people of all ages and backgrounds, enhance people’s quality of life and increase the health and overall well-being of individuals and communities. There is also a significant economic impact.”\nThe objective of this topic is to reinforce and mainstream the foster cross-sectorial cooperation among cultural, health, social, youth, education and humanitarian/ relief sectors as well as researchers and academia of Member State and Associated countries. The proposals should include cultural and creative sectors at large and consider both the active and the receptive nature of cultural participation; a special attention should be given to analyse situations in which art and culture are disruptive for mental health or are polarizing, thus having an adverse impact.\nThey should:\n- Create a dedicated platform to enable policy discussions and exchange of knowledge on culture and well-being, as well as further increasing the connection between arts, culture, health, well-being and inclusion of all individuals into the society, particularly among the health and social care sectors.\n- Provide policy guidelines for implementation and evaluate mixed methods, arts and culture- based interventions that address one or more of the following areas (at least one intervention per area): health promotion; mental health and well-being (with a focus on children and young people, but also including other population segments, such as working people suffering from burn-out); the ageing population; health and well-being of forcibly displaced people; and links between ill-health and patterns of inequality.\n- Create an evidence gap map of arts and health research and innovation within health promotion, illness prevention, trauma recovery, disease management, and/or disease treatment.\nThe proposals should collect new practices and policies, evaluate various types of art and culture interventions, in order to better understand their clinical effectiveness and their cost effectiveness. The proposals should develop convincing narratives from the point of view of arts and health economics, health policies and more widely, well-being economics. Well-being is considered here both from an individual and from a societal and community perspective, therefore social cohesion and inclusion should be considered a priority. Moreover, the proposals should allow to map existing research and innovation gaps, identify potential existing barriers and propose a mixed model for cooperation that will take into account participation at the local, national and regional level and the coordination of different sectors and stakeholders.\nThe proposals should include arts and culture organisations with experience in the area of cross-sectorial collaboration with the other sectors mentioned above.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

A comprehensive analysis of ICH’s potential for societal resilience and its contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation becomes available.\nAdditionally, proposals should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:\n- Policymakers (at all levels), public authorities and stakeholders have access to an array of innovative practices, strategies, and tools for incorporating ICH in community resilience planning, for ICH innovative safeguarding and for expanding community engagement with ICH practice, safeguarding, and communication. This includes awareness of gender dynamics in ICH practices.\n- Innovative policies aimed at preserving ICH amid disasters, conflicts, migration, and population displacements are supported by data and knowledge.\n- New methodological approaches and tools using digital technologies for documenting, communicating, and transmitting ICH become available. Community engagement with ICH, particularly among youth, crucial for sustainable and intergenerational transmission of living cultural practices, is broadened. The alliance between communities and researchers is strengthened. The involvement of education and heritage preservation institutions and agencies is enhanced.\n- The sustainable use of ICH as source of inspiration for creative designs and practices, to spur sustainable development and provide a valuable resource to communities, e.g. for attracting cultural tourism, is enhanced. Measures to prevent overuse, inappropriate use, and depletion are strengthened.\n- A future research agenda is devised for sustainable ICH practices respecting cultural diversity, human rights, and gender equality; cultural aspects of societal resilience will be addressed.",
      "scope": "Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) includes traditions, oral histories, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, as defined by UNESCO [1] . ICH represents a repository of traditional knowledge and forms the backbone of a community's identity and continuity.\nSocietal challenges such as globalization, urbanization, migration, conflicts, disasters, and climate change significantly threaten the safeguarding and transmission of these cultural legacies. Additional threats include rural depopulation, an ageing society, and a growing disconnection between older and younger generations [2] . Research on ICH is dynamic but noteworthy gaps exist. There is a need for comprehensive risk assessments on the impact of societal challenges and climate change on ICH, including the erosion of cultural practices due to migration, displacement, or to a changed living environment.\nA crucial under-researched area is the role of ICH in strengthening resilience against societal challenges and disasters and in fostering climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Traditional knowledge systems and practices developed over generations by communities, including indigenous communities, and embedded within ICH, provide insights for sustainable natural resource management and adaptation strategies tuned to local ecosystems. This includes identifying natural hazard risks, disaster response, and post-disaster restoration of social and natural environments. Additionally, ICH practices such as rituals, storytelling, or traditional craftsmanship, help preserve cultural identity while enhancing mental health and quality of life, contributing to social well-being, community resilience, and recovery efforts.\nIn parallel, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to sustain and revitalize ICH by fostering participatory approaches that actively involve communities, with particular attention to young people, whose engagement is key for safeguarding and transmitting ICH. Furthermore, strengthening research-community collaboration and involving the education sector are essential for co-creating knowledge and innovation with concrete societal impacts. Potential areas for exploration include innovative methods to promote and safeguard ICH, and bridging gaps in heritage roles, including women’s contribution in the safeguarding and transmission of ICH. Advanced digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, can innovate support for ICH through sustainable documentation, safeguarding, and dissemination, including through immersive experiences, and respecting the balance between safeguarding and evolution. Consideration should be given to preserving audiovisual collections which serve as carrier of ICH and capture its history and evolution. Proposals might consider leveraging the digital platform and tools provided by the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage [3] .\nLeveraging ICH through sustainable practices can contribute to sustainable development. ICH reveals ways of living that are less resource demanding. For example, traditional building techniques can inspire sustainable architectural designs; centuries-old agricultural practices can inform organic farming; and traditional crafts, music, and folklore can drive innovation in fashion, product design, and the arts. By integrating intangible cultural elements into modern practices, communities can create globally resonant, high-value products while keeping their cultural significance. Cultural tourism, centred around ICH, can boost local economies, and foster intercultural dialogue. Maintaining the integrity of ICH and preventing depletion is essential, as is ensuring the sustainability and fair distribution of benefits from ICH among the community.\nProposals should consider involving communities bearing and practicing intangible cultural heritage alongside with researchers and other stakeholders. Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, and networks, notably those funded by the European Union. They should complement ongoing Horizon Europe projects and are expected to liaise with the European Partnership on Resilient Cultural Heritage (see HORIZON-CL2-2025-03-HERITAGE-01).\nThe Commission expects funded projects to regularly coordinate with relevant Cluster 2 projects (including those under the European Partnership on Resilient Cultural Heritage) to ensure complementarity of deliverables and outcomes, where appropriate.\n[1] Convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage (2003) https://ich.unesco.org/en/convention .

[6]\nThe partnership will focus on resilience as the individual and collective capacity to anticipate, respond and adapt to situations where the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage becomes more challenging due to increased risks of loss and damage. At the same time, the potential of cultural heritage to support resilience needs to be harnessed, as cultural heritage has a strong societal, environmental, economic ,psychological and well-being dimension and contributes to the construction and preservation of individual and collective identity and acceptance of incoming changes.\nThrough its ability to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, cultural heritage authorities and professionals, citizens, innovators, policy-makers), the partnership will create a critical mass of resources to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), building on the work of the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Cultural Heritage and the ARCHE Coordination and Support Action funded under Horizon Europe 2021 call for proposals in Cluster 2. Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union, to the extent appropriate. The input of other ERA entities such as HERA [7] , CHANSE [8] , the JPI Climate [9] may be considered.\nProposals should in addition take into account the findings of the first-ever European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) report [10] , which calls for decisive evidence-based actions to prevent lock-in in maladaptive pathways to address climate-related risks, such as in land-use planning and long-lived infrastructure. The partnership is expected to contribute to the Communication Managing climate risks - protecting people and prosperity , which requires improving the science base for future adaptation actions and aims to foster innovation and build resilience. [11] The partnership should also develop its activities considering the 8 th Environment Action Programme Mid-Term Review as published in March 2024. [12]\nGiven that climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency, intensity and complexity of natural disasters within the Union and worldwide, the partnership should in addition contribute to achieving the objectives of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism [13] , which includes a focus area on cultural heritage when protecting people, environment and property against natural and man-made disasters in a spirit of international solidarity, through practical cooperation and coordination.\nThe partnership should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating transnational research efforts to other activities such as improving access to data and services, optimising the use of and services provided by research infrastructures, as well as networking, capacity building, training and dissemination activities.\nIn the preparation of topics for the partnership’s transnational calls for proposals and additional activities, due attention should be paid to the gender dimension and the intersectionality of grounds for potential discrimination such as disability, age, socio-economic status, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, etc., in order to be in line with EU anti-discrimination policy [14] and to achieve meaningful and significant outcomes that enhance the societal impact of the relevant activities. The advice of gender experts should be taken into account in developing mitigation and adaptation measures at the nexus of cultural heritage and climate change, in examining the functions of cultural heritage and related societal values, and in supporting sustainable development.\nTaking all aforementioned priorities and references into account, the partnership should aim to:\n- Build capacity by fostering fundamental and applied interdisciplinary collaborative research (SSH and STEAM) between the cultural heritage and climate research communities.\n- Provide resources and incentives to conduct holistic research and nurture collaborative actions to drive the transformation towards more sustainable development, just futures and a healthier way of life and overall well-being.\n- Create and disseminate new knowledge, techniques, skills, strategies and materials for sustainable preservation, conservation, and management of climate-related risks in the cultural heritage field as well as other man-made related risks.\n- Promote innovations in industries and to provide scaled-up solutions and applications for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n- Develop a coherent methodology for obtaining reliable information, quantitative and qualitative data on cultural heritage and climate change, as well as on the costs and benefits of adaptation measures, with particular emphasis on processes and life cycles related to the circular economy.\n- Improve long-term monitoring of cultural heritage through the use of innovative technologies and risk management models to document, inventory and predict the negative and positive impacts of climate change on and through cultural heritage.\n- Integrate cultural heritage into mainstream climate change and environmental regulations, policies and adaptation strategies by operationalising heritage-based solutions and knowledge of the past.\n- Provide policy recommendations to enhance social cohesion and the European sense of belonging through cultural heritage in communities and societies impacted by climate change.\n- Encourage the continued conservation and preservation (through maintenance) by involving, educating and facilitating community participation, with a special focus on sustainability and a quality approach.\n- Increase collaboration across countries and regions and to move away from a focus on individual geopolitical regions to overcome the fragmentation of the wide landscape of stakeholders, competences, resources, policies, programmes and initiatives.\nThe partnership is open to all EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. [15] Partners are expected to contribute financially and/or in kind, depending on the level of ambition of the proposed activities. The partnership should be open to new partners throughout its lifetime. Important note: the EU contribution will not be increased accordingly.\nThe partnership should include or engage with the following stakeholders: (i) ministries responsible for R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology funding agencies and foundations; (ii) ministries responsible for cultural heritage, education, environment, spatial planning and development, tourism, etc., as well as other relevant national and regional authorities, organisations and providers; (iii) research infrastructures such as the European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science (E-RIHS); (iv) industry; and (v) charities and other non-profit organisations, for example of end-users of cultural heritage assets, active in safeguarding cultural heritage and/or in adapting to or mitigating the effects of climate change.\nThe governance structure of the partnership should implicate the relevant stakeholders in advance to coordinate, guide and mentor the research and innovation activities and facilitate the use and uptake of the results. The partnership’s activities should give rise to ready-to-use solutions. The governance structure should involve key stakeholders, including, but not limited to, the research and innovation community and cultural heritage professionals from sectors relevant to the scope of the partnership. In order to enhance the societal impact of the activities, the approach should empower citizens to contribute to the co-design/co-creation/co-assessment of research and innovation agendas/contents/outcomes.\nTo ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to establish relevant complementarities with other Horizon Europe actions under relevant Clusters of Pillar II, partnerships and missions, such as “Adaptation to climate change – Climate-ADAPT”, “Restoring our ocean and waters by 2030”, “Biodiversa+”, “Climate-neutral and smart cities”, “Built4People”, and the “New European Bauhaus” Facility. [16]\nProposals should be complementary to ongoing Horizon Europe projects to ensure the complementarity of deliverables and outcomes, where appropriate. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance of regular joint coordination meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activity, without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The partnership will be encouraged to develop cross-fertilisation links with projects funded since the beginning of Horizon Europe notably under Cluster 2, following the call topics within the Green priority of Destination 2, topics relating to the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) or projects such as those selected on the basis of topics HORIZON-CL2-2021-HERITAGE-01-01 – Green technologies and materials for cultural heritage [17] , HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-08 - Effects of climate change and natural hazards on cultural heritage and remediation [18] , or HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-01: Advanced technologies for remote monitoring of heritage monuments and artefacts [19] .\nProposals should also explore how to co-operate with other relevant EU and international actions and describe specific activities envisaged. They could propose to facilitate interactions and knowledge transfer with various economic sectors such as: cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCIs), agricultural and forestry policy, blue economy sectors, sustainable tourism, circular economy, infrastructures and construction, as well as society changes and transitions; urbanisation, spatial planning, regional growth, sustainable tourism development. [20]\nMoreover, proposals should consider synergies with different EU programmes, including EU space programmes (Copernicus, Galileo) to foster the use of emerging or operational space technologies for policy development, and the Digital Europe programme. [21] Cooperation with the JRC may be envisaged, in particular for actions related to monitoring monuments, cultural heritage sites and cultural landscapes. The partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable).\nThe partnership should be linked to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology’s Knowledge and Innovation Community - EIT Culture & Creativity as there is a common aim to scale up and widen to as many Member States/Associated Countries as possible a culture and creativity-driven European innovation ecosystem.\nProposals may include synergies between Horizon Europe and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programmes, including Interreg programmes, since Horizon Europe seeks to promote synergies with other EU programmes and to combine Horizon Europe funding with other EU, national or regional funding instruments in the same operation, project or initiative in order to achieve greater impact and efficiency (cumulative/complementary funding). [22]\nTo address the ambitious challenges in front of the partnership, cooperation with international organisations, the private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. The participation of third countries is encouraged but their commitment to the partnership would not be taken into account for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their cooperation and the objectives they wish to achieve by joining the partnership.\nProposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. It is expected that the partnership organises joint calls on an annual basis and will therefore have sufficient time to carry out the co-funded projects.\nThe total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 60 million and subject to the effective implementation of the financial commitments made by the members of the consortium.\nThe expected duration of the partnership is seven to ten years.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’): https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119\n[2] European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025-2027 , Publications Office of the European Union, 2024, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/092911 , p. 8.\n[3] Definition of cultural heritage mentioned in the Council conclusions of 21 May 2014 on cultural heritage as a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe (2014/C 183/08) and recalled in the European Framework for Action on cultural heritage: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5a9c3144-80f1-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1\n[4] SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 5 Gender Equality, SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions and SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals.\n[5] Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 of 5 October 2016 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, pp. 1-3);

      "expected_outcome": "In line with the European Climate Law [1] and its vision for a climate-neutral and resilient Europe by 2050, this topic aims at supporting transnational activities which will enable or contribute to several expected impacts of the Horizon Europe programme and its 2 nd Strategic Plan 2025-2027, in particular expected impact 8, related to realising the full potential of cultural heritage, and impact 21, related to advancing science for a fair transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society. [2] To that end, proposals under this topic should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Public funders of research and innovation actions, policy-makers and research communities are provided with a holistic and strategic research and innovation multi-annual programme of activities related to cultural heritage [3] and resilience (European Partnership for Resilient Cultural Heritage, hereafter referred to as partnership), including challenges, expected impacts, outcomes, objectives, governance, and opportunities for cooperation contributing to the achievement of the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [4] and the targets of the Paris Agreement [5] ;\n- Investments in research and innovation at the intersection of cultural heritage and climate change sciences are increased and better co-ordinated between the two fields of research through the sharing of findings, data, tools and methodologies across sectors for the benefit of the society as a whole. To this end, research-based policy recommendations will be proposed to policy- and decision-makers in different sectors of governance at national and regional levels, with a view to overcoming existing fragmentation in the European Research Area (ERA);\n- Research funders, businesses, policymakers, cultural heritage professionals and research communities from various scientific disciplines covered by STEAM (natural and formal sciences, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and SSH (social sciences and humanities), as well as actors from different economic sectors will work towards common objectives and measures. The long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for the partnership will aim to demonstrate the role and potential of tangible and intangible cultural heritage in advancing Europe’s climate neutrality and green transition by providing innovative and traditional knowledge-based solutions;\n- A significantly strengthened scientific knowledge base at the intersection of heritage- and climate sciences contributes to more effective climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. Policy-makers and various stakeholders, including local communities, should be enabled to learn and draw lessons from the past, design and tailor risk management to specific threats and the resulting challenges for the traditions and living areas of different populations, cultural landscapes and sites, monuments, intangible cultural heritage and other assets, such as museums, libraries and archives collections under their responsibility;\n- European cultural heritage professionals and stakeholders will engage with a wide range of partners from the EU, Associated Countries and worldwide, in the research and innovation actions under the partnership to address the global challenges of climate change, deploy good practices and enhance cultural heritage transnational research, its societal impact and Europe’s leading position in the field of cultural heritage and climate neutrality.",

      "expected_outcome": "Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Collect data and analyse the prevalence and impact of gender-based violence (GBV), including tech-facilitated GBV, in different socio-economic contexts and legislative frameworks, and provide policymakers at regional, national and EU level with recommendations to address it.\n- Support employers, policymakers, practitioners, and civil society organisations in their work on the prevention, protection, prosecution, and provision of services in addressing GBV, including through promoting best practice sharing, mutual learning and education material focused on consent.",
      "scope": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is a prevalent issue, with 1 in 3 women in the EU having experienced physical and/or sexual violence, 22% of women in the EU having experienced violence by an intimate partner, and 55% having been sexually harassed. [1] GBV has destructive consequences for individuals, organisations, the economy, and society as a whole. Gender-based violence is violence directed against a person because of that person's gender or violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately. It can be sexual, physical, verbal, psychological, or economic and occur in different forms, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, important knowledge gaps remain on the prevalence and impact of gender-based violence across different social and economic areas. For example, in certain sectors, occupations and work arrangements, like night work, healthcare, hospitality, social services, emergency services, transport and education, workers are more exposed to violence and harassment, although comparable, intersectional data is often still lacking in these fields. [2] While the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in domestic violence, still little is known about the impact of the associated rise in teleworking on women’s working conditions, including the safety of their working environment. Moreover, in sports, initial studies on sexual GBV showed that a significant percentage of female athletes in Europe are exposed to sexual harassment [3] , but no comprehensive pan-European data is available on this.\nAnother research field, which requires further attention is the impact of tech-facilitated GBV, including non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit images, manipulated intimate images (e.g., deepfakes and other forms of generative AI), or child sexual abuse online, as well as the potential positive and negative use and effects of AI on GBV.\nTherefore, proposals should look at gender-based violence in one or more of the following areas: 1) GBV in the world of work, 2) GBV in sports 3) GBV on online platforms.\nAcross these areas, proposals should take into account online and offline forms of gender-based violence, and consider intersecting factors, such as age, socio-economic and migrant background, disability, racial or ethnic origin , religion, geography, as well as gender identity and sexual orientation. Proposals should also address the role of bystanders and superiors in addressing gender-based violence and assess the availability and effectiveness of victim support. For data collection, proposals should make use of surveys, as well as administrative data, where available, to assess how public services respond to the needs of GBV survivors and can foster a safe environment. Where appropriate, proposals should seek the involvement of law enforcement, prosecutors and judges, together with academia/SSH research to optimise input and uptake. For proposals addressing the world of work, the involvement of social partners is encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThe outcomes of this research will be particularly important in view of recent policy developments, including the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention, the EU Directive on Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, Commission Recommendation on integrated child protection to protect children from all forms of violence, as wells the ILO Convention no.190 on eliminating violence and harassment in the World of Work.\nSynergies with projects under the DAPHNE strand of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programme are encouraged. International cooperation is encouraged, in line with the Gender Equality Strategy for External Action (GAPIII).\n[1] European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, Violence against women: an EU-wide survey.

Analyse and evaluate forms of collaborative and participatory approaches to the management and governance of transition processes, including through social dialogue and collective bargaining.",
      "scope": "The geographic variation in the impact of the European Green Deal is crucially important. Even though the green transition will have a positive impact and will improve our societies in many respects, regions with sizable employment in coal mining or traditional vehicle manufacturing will be disproportionately impacted. The resulting labour market imbalances can be addressed by people's movements within and between countries and training and skilling policies adapted to regional contexts.\nThe current economic system favours urbanisation, with jobs and skilled labour now concentrated in large urban areas. However, many jobs needed for the transition towards carbon neutrality are not in the most urbanised regions. Further still, green jobs will not automatically be created in regions with declining industries (such as coal mining, traditional vehicle manufacturing, or maritime transportation ports).\nOne important field of research should be on mechanisms of geographic mobility of labour (of EU citizens and third country nationals), incorporating a gender perspective to understand how mobility patterns differ and influence workforce dynamics. This is particularly pertinent given the documented impact of gender occupational segregation on labour market outcomes.\nAnother important research avenue is firm adaptation. Much of the current research is focused on the closing of factories and the subsequent reallocation of labour. However, the great challenge of the green transition is how to prevent existing businesses from closing and to upgrade them in a circular, cost- and resource-efficient manner, and make them more competitive. There is, therefore, a need to study cases of successful transitions that may not involve closing of factories and the policies and practices that enabled them.\nPast transitions can provide insight into how to handle economic readjustment in regions strongly impacted by the green transformations. The success of the green and energy transitions hinges on political feasibility. Research is needed to understand what drives feasibility across contexts and how it can be strengthened. Past transitions have forced regions and communities to diversify their economic models. In this regard, they bear many similarities to the green transition.\nTo ensure Europe will benefit from current transitions, proposals should employ a whole ecosystem approach and draw from a rich variety of (SSH) disciplines including history, sociology, economics, and geography. Proposals may focus on policies which favoured local job creation, upskilling, labour mobility, and business model diversification. Proposals may also focus on the experiences of workers to provide adaptation lessons for the current transitions. Another research perspective could be the role social conflicts and compromises linked with social partners and how these have shaped past transitions. Lastly, proposals may take into account other key megatrends such as labour-saving technological innovation or demographic changes and evaluate how those change in the context of past and current industrial transformations, and how these impact different groups disproportionately.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).",

      "scope": "Reduction of the working time, understood as a coordinated reduction in weekly working hours concentrated into an extra free day per week without a corresponding decrease in pay, has existed in the economic debate for more than a century, yet much of its potential impact on economic, social, and environmental aspects remains unexplored.\nRecently, various initiatives at national, company, and sectoral levels have been launched to test the employment and societal outcomes of these reduced working arrangements. Past experiences generally show some positive evidence on workers’ well-being and wages, with marginal impacts on employment levels, but mixed outcomes regarding productivity. Yet, understanding the feasibility of working time reduction across different sectors and occupations is key to assessing its impacts on inequality, societal fairness, and overall economic growth. Moreover, the gender perspective and impacts on workforce inclusion in the working time reduction context is an area that is yet to be thoroughly understood. There is a wide range of environmental outcomes from working time reduction to be also considered, including energy costs and savings, energy poverty, and consumption patterns.\nMore insights are needed to understand the full battery of enablers, barriers, benefits, challenges, and policy implications arising from implementation of working time reduction, including at organisational level, across a diverse variety of sectors.\nWhile feeding into the expected outcomes, the research project should assess the impacts of working time reduction along at least two out of the three axes: economic, social, and environmental.\nThese may include but are not limited to the following channels:\n- Social impacts on workers, including well-being at the workplace, health outcomes (including stress levels), work-life balance, gendered employment outcomes, labour market inclusion;\n- Economic impacts, including effects on productivity, employment, economic growth, hiring and staff retention, absenteeism, firm costs, overall economic demand, innovation;\n- Environmental impacts, including on energy expenditures and savings, energy poverty, emission reduction, consumption patterns, sustainable lifestyles.\nApplicants are encouraged to employ a variety of SSH research methods, including quantitative micro-economic analysis or behavioural and other experimental research methods.\nProposers may consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences domain [1] .\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "Un(der)declared work, as well as the evasion of compulsory payments linked to workers’ remuneration (e.g. bogus self-employment to avoid payment to social security schemes) hinder fair social market economy and reduce the sustainability of social protection system.\nThe proliferation of disruptive technologies, the increased presence of third-country nationals in the Member States, as well as rapidly rising living costs are leading to higher volatility on the labour market, including an accelerated rate of change in the characteristics of labour demand and supply, and new forms of employment such as e.g. project work in the gig-economy. These circumstances are conducive to growing inequality on the labour market and a spread of unfair practices, including un(der)declared work and the evasion of compulsory payments.\nThe SSH research activities are expected to have a strong multidisciplinary aspect. Proposals should contribute to advancing research on the scope, volume and/or characteristics of un(der)declared work in the economy and/or the evasion of compulsory payments linked to workers’ remuneration. Subsequent research activities should contribute to our understanding of the causes and main structural drivers behind actors’ willingness to engage in un(der)declared work and/or the related evasion of compulsory payments.

The proposals are encouraged to consider the impact of disruptive technologies (e. g. digital platforms, cloud computing, generative artificial intelligence) on the proliferation and/or changing features of un(der)declared work.\nThe proposal may:\n- focus on methods seeking to address social desirability bias in public surveys\n- focus on experiments and/or counterfactual analysis to advance the measurement of the impact of policy interventions\n- focus on mechanisms of efficient cooperation among national authorities responsible for tackling un(der)declared work\n- explore opportunities for the use of machine learning in tackling un(der)declared work\n- explore un(der)declared work in the platform economy and/or in new professions created in response to rapid technological change\n- focus on un(der)declared work among mobile workers\n- insights from behavioural research into drivers behind un(der)declared work and/or the evasion of compulsory payments.\n- explore the potential for social-demographic or other typologies of undeclared work\n- aim at a establishing a more systematic link between un(der)declared work and taxation system or social security system.\n- examine gender and social stratification variations in the nature of un(der)declared work (e.g., occupational segregation, motives, working time patterns).\nClustering and cooperation with other relevant projects are strongly encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "The European Education Area [1] aims to improve access to quality education for all. The strategic framework for the European Education Area set the EU-level target: “ The share of low-achieving 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics and science should be less than 15%, by 2030 ” (Council of the European Union 2021). The latest data (2022) suggest that the European Union average is much higher [2] than 15% and that pupils from low socio-economic status face a considerably higher risk of low achievement than their peers from high socio-economic background. Student performance varies widely, with differences at the student, school and education system levels. Improving educational quality and closing gaps in learning outcomes are important societal issues, and a major challenge for education systems across the European Union. There is a research gap in the empirical evaluation of education policies and practices and the understanding of the circumstances under which they are most beneficial. There is also a gap in the translation of scientific evidence into practices in educational institutions.\nThe action must enhance interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers in education and engage diverse educational research disciplines from social sciences, the arts and humanities. The action must include the perspectives of policy makers and practitioners who look at similar topics from different angles. The action should analyse policies in at least one level of education, with a particular focus on transitions from the previous level of education and to the next. Proposals may choose to analyse and evaluate general measures for all learners or targeted and individualised support in inclusive settings. Involvement of authorities responsible for the education and training policies is essential and should be ensured. The action should enhance collaborations to improve the access of researchers to administrative data and other types of data, including surveys of children and young people, to develop new research approaches and perspectives. Therefore, close cooperation with authorities and/or other institutions owning the data is essential and should be ensured.\nThe action should analyse and evaluate policy measures in their context, using a mixed methods approach including qualitative and quantitative methods. Proposals can include an experimental design, using e.g. small, randomized control trials and quasi-experimental methods (such as difference-in-difference or discontinuity designs) to test the effectiveness of specific interventions in different contexts. Proposals can also include participatory research approaches. Complementarities with the projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-05, HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-06; HORIZON-CL2-2024-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-10 and Topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-10 are encouraged.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "Digital devices and tools are an integral part in the lives of children and teenagers as they grow. There is discussion about the impact of the use of digital tools in everyday life on children’s wellbeing (cognitive, emotional, social) and development, but the evidence is often piecemeal [1] Proposals should investigate the impact that the expansion and normalisation of children’s use of digital technologies (including generative AI) in everyday life has on their learning, at a time in their lives when literacy and numeracy skills are developing, and during adolescence.\nProposals may select different target groups to investigate how intersecting factors influence children’s experiences with digital tools, paying a particular attention to age, gender, disabilities, digital exclusion of marginalised groups, and socio-economic status. In this context, proposals should investigate how the school learning environment can support learning and identify effective interventions to support children’s social emotional and academic needs. Proposals should focus on primary and/ or secondary general compulsory education, and they could choose to address one or several age groups.\nWhile educational institutions cannot act in isolation, students spend thousands of hours within buildings, and the same holds for teachers and school leaders. Sustainable Development Goal (4.a.) emphasises the importance of physical learning environment in education facilities. Proposals could investigate the impact of learning environments on education outcomes and how its design responds to changes in teaching and learning.\nProposals should propose methods that address the complex nature of the topic under study, the existing data and the rapid changes in the technological landscape. Proposals are encouraged to use mixed methods approaches, and deepen inter- and transdisciplinary research in education (including from SSH disciplines), involving multiple perspectives, with the aim to improve learning and educational settings. Proposals can choose on which aspect of student well-being (cognitive, emotional, social) and skill development they focus. Proposals should include the voice of children and young people through active and meaningful participation and other relevant stakeholders as part of the data collection.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\n[1] For example, mobile phones or smartphones could have a potentially unprecedented impact on children’s development, as the frequency of engagement is likely to be high. Possible impacts include for example cognitive overload, increased distraction, altering memory and learning patterns, impact on sleep duration and sleep quality, on wellbeing among adolescent girls and boys, on wider social activities, such as sport or cultural activities, or on leisure. There are also concerns that excessive screen time can impact children’s social and emotional development, leading to debates about the quality of their interactions. Recent findings from the PISA survey highlight a negative correlation between leisurely digital device use at school and academic performance.",

This includes effectiveness studies as well as the delivery of data, including health economics data of the developed intervention(s) to further advance this policy area; and\n- Provide quality evidence-based data to policy makers and research and innovation stakeholders to bridge the gap between mental health outcomes and related socio-economic transition.",
      "scope": "In Europe, 84 million citizens ranging from the youth to ageing population of all socio-economic backgrounds of all genders, including vulnerable groups are suffering from various mental health issues in their everyday lives at home, at work, at school as well as in the virtual cyber-world. The mental health issues affect people in different ways and/or period(s) of their life course as well as the people who live, work and/or study in vicinity of these persons with mental health issues, and/or people who belong to their family, friends and/or social circuits.\nThe foundation of mental health is mostly laid in adolescence: half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age and most cases go undetected and untreated. The staggering figures show that the second leading cause for death of young people of 15-19 years is suicide after the road accidents.\nAddressing and treating mental health conditions is therefore essential to improve the downstream impacts on education, training and work and future socio-economic outcomes. It also represents a long-term investment in public health.\nOver the past years, many innovative solutions (supported EU Framework Programmes for research and Innovation and/or international, national, regional, and local initiatives) for tackling mental health problems have been developed. However, few interventions have been implemented at scale. There lacks evidence about the feasibility, acceptability and suitability of these mental health interventions at scale.\nBuilding on innovative solutions supported by EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation and/or international, national, regional, and local initiatives, the challenges of the topic are:\n- to significantly increase / scale-up the percentage of interventions that are actually used, and\n- to involve families, individuals/communities, stakeholders and authorities, such as public services, civil society organisations in the development and implementation of interventions aimed at heterogeneous segments of population\nAdditional evidence is also needed about to which extend mental health interventions are actually cost-effective and cost-efficient – looking via various policy perspectives, e.g. education, training, working life, well-being and health. This would aid policy makers to decide on which one (or a combination) of the policy choices to use when weighing up policy choices in investment for education, training and work- related outcomes.\nTo ensure replicability, projects are required to specify clearly how they target primary prevention (benefitting an entire target group), and/ or secondary prevention (provided for vulnerable groups and individuals with existing mental health problems). The project design and implementation should clearly outline and justify who they are targeting with what types of interventions and in what type(s) of contexts.\nSpecial attention should be paid to the visibility and communication of the research and innovation findings to direct beneficiaries of the intervention and their families, communities, wider publics and stakeholders from the start of the work.\nClustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged. Considering the complex design and implementation of these projects, it is expected that projects may take 4 years or more to deliver solid evidence for take-up by policy makers, practitioners and stakeholders, which also justifies an appropriate budget per project.\nWhere applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).",

If possible, identify specific measures and tools for different addressed areas of lives of persons with disabilities, such as education, recruitment, hiring, return to work, and independent life.\n- Identify and compare the usefulness of different options for policies and measures aiming to increase the autonomy and quality of life of persons with disabilities, as well as the quality of life and well-being of their families, using a person-centred approach, taking into account the individual needs of persons with disabilities and ensuring their full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on equal basis with others.\n- Identify relevant actors to achieve effective results (public actors, civil society organizations, private sector, social economy actors, etc.) and explore their roles and interaction, with a view to assessing integration among different social, support and essential services (including e.g. transport or housing) necessary to promote autonomy and inclusion in the community.",
      "scope": "The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [1] recognises the right to individual autonomy and independence for persons with disabilities, including the freedom to make their own choices. Ensuring this right requires a differentiated landscape of measures in all areas of society, including ensuring accessibility and quality person-centred support services.\nHaving affordable and community-based services and measures in place, which meet the individual needs of persons with disabilities, is a basic pre-condition for autonomy and independence. Social and support services and measures need to be inclusive and accessible for persons with disabilities of any age and with any disability. The proposals may focus on a specific disability or address several of them. Research (including from SSH disciplines) should address barriers and solutions with regard to specific disabilities to increase inclusiveness, decision-making and autonomy, taking into account the integrated and person-centred support provided by families. The role of the family as carers and as the first agent to promote inclusion needs to be addressed. Different solutions for accessible and inclusive housing could also be explored.\nA key aspect of the autonomy and independence of persons with disabilities is the access to inclusive education, training, active labour market measures and employment in the open labour market. Promising support practices in these areas should be mapped, analysed and tested, including the integration and communication between different services for a user-centred approach.\nEuropean Education Area initiatives such as the Council Recommendation on Pathways to School Success [2] aim to address equity and inclusion in education. A wide range of actions and peer learning activities aimed at supporting inclusive education are also implemented, in particular through two European Education Area strategic framework Working Groups [3] : Working Group on Equality and Values in Education and Training and Working Group on Schools – Pathways to School Success.\nThe proposals should consider the impact – including the impact on the self-esteem of persons with disabilities – of inclusive education versus special needs education or special schools/classes for promoting the autonomy of persons with disabilities. The proposals may also consider the role of special training and lifelong learning adapted to persons with physical, mental, intellectual or sensory disabilities.\nNew and innovative ways of increasing the autonomy of persons with disabilities need to be explored and tested with the objective to reduce inequalities, promote their full inclusion in society in different areas of life, including education, family life, employment, living arrangements, leisure, arts, culture and sport, and improve their quality of life, as well as the quality of life and well-being of their families. This includes the use of assistive technology and other accessible digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) measures and tools to increase accessibility in society and overall communication, social participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities.\nThe possible loneliness, impact on emotional well-being and inactivity status of many persons with disabilities needs to be addressed when designing approaches to increase their autonomy and independence. Moreover, the higher risk of persons with disabilities to be exposed to abuse, neglect (including self-neglect), scams and aggression needs to be considered, including when disability is combined (from an intersectional perspective) with other conditions which may be a source of vulnerability (e.g. age, gender, migrant status, discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin). Loneliness and other mental health issues (e.g. burnout) suffered by family carers or other informal carers may be also considered.\nProposals should include civil society engagement and dialogue, for wider input and uptake. Proposals are encouraged to seek synergies and collaboration whenever possible with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-HLTH-2025-01-STAYHLTH-01: Improving the quality of life of persons with intellectual disabilities and their families. Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces.

      "scope": "Demographic trends over the last decade and future projections show that the share of the population aged 65+ is growing, both in comparison to the working-age population and to the child population. This is due to an increasing life expectancy and lower fertility and poses major challenges for intergenerational fairness and affects the implicit social contract across generations.\nThere is a growing need to provide an adequate framework for addressing fairness across generations (including knowledge on past generations, current and in particular future ones) related to education and labour market opportunities and outcomes, wealth accumulation and distribution of economic gains and costs, housing affordability, well-being and health, including environmental impact, role of institutions and public services, in the face of new challenges, such as ever-faster technological and climate change and changing public preferences.\n- Proposals should provide in-depth analysis of at least 3 different drivers of intergenerational inequalities such as, but not exclusively, from the ones listed above, and the interdependence between them.\n- Proposals should investigate intergenerational fairness, solidarity and trust through an intersectional lens, considering gender, family structure, racial or ethnic origin, socioeconomic and migration backgrounds.\n- Proposals may have a regional and/or national dimension.\n- Proposals may focus on developing and/or forecasting intergenerational fairness indicators.\n- Proposals may draw lessons from recent policy interventions in EU Member States in a contextual and transdisciplinary manner and propose adjustment measures or test them through social innovation experiments.\n- Proposals may focus on democratic participation and socially inclusive pathways to co-creating public values for current and future generations.\nClustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.\nApplicants are encouraged to consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences domain, particularly SHARE (ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ri-portfolio/table/). Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nProposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) based on its experience and with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research activities and policymaking.",

      "scope": "Proposals should develop a strategic roadmap that will act as a comprehensive framework for understanding the impacts of climate change on migration and its impact on future generations and outline key research and policy priorities in the context of environmental degradation, climate change and migration.\nHaving developed such a roadmap, proposals should develop a dynamic exchange platform with up-to-date information, to be accessed by all concerned parties, involved in climate change and migration including EU and national authorities, researchers, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders. This platform should be collaborative, user-editable, and community-driven, allowing for future updates and contributions from various stakeholders. It should act as comprehensive go-to place, a source repository, and a networking and coordination space, with a focus on integrating climate change considerations into migration policies. The platform should incorporate comprehensive data on migration patterns, including on international and internal displacements, on international destinations including neighbouring EU countries, and EU arrivals, and on climate change as a root cause or its interaction with other root causes, with the goal to inform policy decisions.\nProposals should identify gaps and set the groundwork for future research and policy initiatives. They should adopt an interdisciplinary approach integrating climate, population, and human mobility studies addressing the complex relationship between environmental disasters and migration intentions. They should encompass a broader analysis of vulnerabilities, such as internal displacements, how preexisting inequalities (e.g. social, economic, political, health, gender) are exacerbated due to climate change, and populations stranded in their countries of origin, aligning with EU's external policy frameworks for adaptation strategies [1] .\nProposals should consider the involvement of the Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography (KCMD) operated by the European Commission’s JRC [2] with a view to be sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project. In particular:\n- the structure and the format of the platform should be decided together with DG RTD, DG HOME and the JRC, and it should be built and hosted within the web environment of the Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography as part of its knowledge management efforts;\n- the development of the roadmap is encouraged to be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, particularly including with DG RTD, DG HOME and the JRC;\n- findings and recommendations should be translated in very concise policy briefs, preferably in coordination with the KCMD.\nProposals could identify local case studies to perform context-specific analysis and extract actionable insights and scalable solutions that could inform broader migration and climate adaptation policies. These local case studies could explore the impact of climate change in different regions and the phenomenon of environmental immobility, where individuals are unable or unwilling to move despite facing significant environmental threats.\nThe proposals are strongly encouraged to look into the findings of completed Horizon 2020 projects on forecast and foresight, particularly from the topic ‘MIGRATION-01-2019 - Understanding migration mobility patterns: elaborating mid and long-term migration scenarios’, and wherever possible build on their outcomes and methodology [3] . They are also encouraged to build on the deliverables of project INNOVATE [4] and of relevant projects of Destination “Effective management of EU external borders” of Horizon Europe Cluster’s 3/Horizon 2020’ SC7, such as projects ITFLOWS [5] , CRITERIA [6] , MIRROR [7] and PERCEPTIONS [8] , as well as the relevant use cases and pilots conducted as part of the Destination Earth initiative [9] .\nProposals should consider incorporating in the platform the data provided by European Research Infrastructures, such as the European Social Survey [10] or other Research Infrastructures dealing with climate change and environment. Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThe selected project should produce a range of feasible policy recommendations. These recommendations should be based on evaluations of existing EU humanitarian aid, development and migration policies and drafted as policy options that are directly actionable , include cost considerations and explicitly recommend additions or modifications of current EU strategies, regulations, and directives. The option of non-action should also be elaborated. The recommendations should be firmly embedded in EU values such as respect for human dignity, gender and age equality, and fundamental rights.\n[1] https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en\n[2] https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/migration-demography_en\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_MIGRATION-01-2019/en\n[4] Beneficiary of the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-04: Bridging the migration research to policy gap https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101132593\n[5] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/882986\n[6] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101021866\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/832921\n[8] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833870\n[9] https://destination-earth.eu/\n[10] ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ri-portfolio/table/",

      "scope": "National Contact Points (NCPs) are support structures that have become an essential component in the implementation of successive Framework Programmes. They provide information and on-the ground advice to potential applicants and beneficiaries, through the project life cycle, in their own language, in a manner that would be impossible for the European Commission and its Agencies acting alone.\nNCPs can benefit in their work from the sharing of best practices among them. NCPs can also help to give visibility to different perspectives of all Security Research and Innovation (R&I) stakeholders and to break geographical silos by aggregating the knowledge existing in the EU Member States and regions and incorporate it to the European picture. This set-up increases the visibility of the security at EU level and across security areas.\nHowever, the security sector exhibits a remarkable geographic fragmentation, with actors operating at EU level, at national level, at regional level and even at local level. In order to acknowledge the different perspectives of all stakeholders and break geographical silos, there is a need to aggregate the knowledge existing in the Member States and Associated countries and incorporate it to the European picture.\nCooperation with national stakeholders and establishment of stronger links with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) [2] .\nThese links should help to have a more comprehensive view of the common EU security needs and solutions, to better capitalise on pan-European cooperation and funding opportunities, and to give visibility to results from EU and other research projects.\nProposals should link NCPs with national communities for research and innovation that exist already or will be established. The idea of this link is to identify capability gaps, solutions to address those gaps, and research needs at local, regional and national level and integrate them in the EU picture in collaboration with CERIS.\nIn addition, this collaboration will assist NCPs to share research opportunities coming from national research programmes and initiatives with the wider security research community at national level. This will also improve the visibility of the results achieved by national players following their participation in research projects (national or EU-funded), and in particular those which have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or which have a strong potential for uptake as a result of the interest expressed by national buyers.\nFinally, this will support the promotion of innovation uptake with financial pathways and opportunities to enable the uptake of innovative solutions stemming from EU, national or regional capacity building funds, with special emphasis on the EU Home Affairs funds (both in the parts under shared management and those under direct management by the Commission) and on the European Regional Development Fund.\nAs an output of the action, the beneficiaries should develop a model for the cooperation and enlargement of with the national research and innovation communities beyond the lifetime of the project and independent of EU security research funding. The objective is to support the establishment of self-standing national communities beyond the duration of the project.\nThe successful proposal will contribute to delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts and raise awareness of potential applicants for calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 3 – \"Civil Security for Society\". Irrespectively of their sector or discipline, project proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The project should also allow for a better flow of information relevant for the implementation of the Programme from the EU level to the national level and vice-versa, and also across Member States and Associated Countries. This includes fostering the participation of national players in EU security research and innovation fora. Particular attention should be given to results that have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or that show a strong potential for uptake because of the interest expressed by national buyers.\nProposals should link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Cluster “Civil Security for Society” building on previous initiatives from similar past projects. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. The project proposal to be funded should cover a wide range of activities related to Horizon Europe, address issues specific to the Cluster \"Civil Security for Society\" and may follow up on the work of SEREN5.\nThe network should organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles. Proposals should also take into account support activities for coordination between the respective beneficiary (NCP) and the respective National Coordination Centre [4] within the relevant Member States as applicable once the regulation mentioned above is in force.\nThe project consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.\nThe recommended duration of the project is 3 years.\n[1] https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/\n[2] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en\n[3] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en\n[4] National Coordination Centres according to regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021.",

      "scope": "Societal resilience and preparedness to disasters are shaped by the way authorities and citizens exchange, access, understand, and react to information about hazards. As a result, anyone may become more vulnerable if barriers to these processes occur. Strengthening societal resilience to disasters, therefore, requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics.\nThe European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The EU’s disaster resilience goal No. 2 is “Prepare – Increasing risk awareness and preparedness of the population [1] . The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting these two policies and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Proposals are invited to utilise the Special Eurobarometer on “Disaster risk awareness and preparedness of the EU population [2] \" as evidence of needs.\nUnder the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions and technology, including the use of AI, for improving disaster preparedness, risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities, and for reinforcing the cooperation among scientific / technical communities and policy-makers / regional and/or local authorities for an enhanced sharing of knowledge and uptake of research outputs. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nProposals are expected to address one of the following options:\nOption a : Tools and solutions to improve disaster preparedness and risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities;\nOption b : Mechanism to enhance dialogue among research/academic communities, practitioners and regional and/or local authorities for sharing knowledge and effectively uptake research results.\nAdapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.\nProposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with citizen organisations, regional and/or local authorities and practitioners (first and second responders/civil protection agencies/disaster management authorities), private sector operators during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.\n[1] (2023/C 56/01); COM (2023) 61 final.\n[2] https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3228",

      "scope": "Improved risk governance, adaptation and resilience requires authorities and communities to adopt risk and resilience management approaches, which are inclusive and innovative, through pre-defined plans and procedures, as well as through adaptable and flexible capabilities to prepare for, respond to, recover from and learn from disasters and crises. It requires the implementation of policies at different levels (international to regional and/or local) and strategies for a better understanding of impacts and enhanced risk preparedness and adaptation, which are co-developed and enabled through all-of-society engagement and participation, and hence strengthen resilience to disasters among authorities, decision-makers, private actors, intermediary actors, volunteers and citizens, and the most vulnerable.\nThe European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy [1] following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users.\nUnder the open topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for an enhanced understanding of impacts of disasters and crises linked to natural or human-made causes on risk governance and improved resilience of emergency systems, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2023-2024. If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nProposals are expected to address one of the following options:\nOption a : Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness;\nOption b : Enhanced impact forecasting and understanding of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRN-E) threats and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention preparedness and response (including medical countermeasures). Projects do not need to address all elements of CBRN-E.\nAdapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.\nProposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with volunteers' organisations, regional and/or local authorities and disaster management authorities during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.\nTo ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., emergency responders (with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats), proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.\nDue to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in LAC (Latin America and Caribbean), African, and Central Asian countries are encouraged to participate.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.\n[1] Europe’s choice – Political guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029, p. 14.",

      "scope": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) tools is increasingly at the core of first responder’s decision-making processes, including situational awareness, analysis and planning. Besides the needs to develop AI and ML tools, ground technologies such as miniaturised sensors that can operate autonomously for a long period in harsh environments and are fast and easy to deploy are needed for threat detection (such as chemical, biological or radiological substances) and/or identification of victims and possible locations for intervention. In addition, responders need to exchange information (language, data, video, etc.) in a reliable, secure, and universal way, while emergency communications throughout the European Union also need to be strengthened [1] . In many instances, interoperability of tools, technologies and communication channels is still an open issue, requiring standard operating procedures, specific education, training and exercises of responders.\nThe European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy [2] following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and follow the recommendations of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the open topic, proposals are welcome to testing / validate tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate / geological / accidental fire disasters and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats (including medical countermeasures) by different practitioner’s sectors in view of demonstrating their interoperability in real-case situations, with focus on the use of AI and ML tools, miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification, and communication (including cross-border emergency communications).\nProposals are expected to address one of the following options focused on testing / validation of tools and technologies, and demonstration of their interoperability:\nOption a : Use of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) tools to support first responder’s analysis, planning and decision-making;\nOption b : Miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification;\nOption c : Information exchange / Communication among first responders in a reliable, secure and universal way, and cross-border emergency communications;\nOption d: Alert system to detect CBRN threats, integrating different systems at national, regional and European levels.\nAdapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions.

This system will perform or support civilian tasks like search and rescue, hazard assessment, and supply transport in areas too dangerous for human responders;\n- Enhanced remote sensing and situational awareness, creating sensor-based technologies that improve situational awareness for first responders and decision-makers, enabling them to assess disaster zones remotely and safely;\n- Autonomous navigation and search capabilities in dangerous environments focusing on technologies that enhance the ability of autonomous systems to perform search operations in low-visibility or smoky conditions, typical of areas impacted by bombings, fires, or other conflict-related incidents;\n- User-centred and real-world testing in environments that replicate the conditions of conflict zones and urban disasters;\n- Capacity building and training for autonomous system deployment providing specialised training guidelines for first responders and civil protection agencies to operate and maintain autonomous systems effectively in conflict scenarios.",
      "scope": "Conflicts such as the Russian war against Ukraine and the overall geopolitical context marked by tensions and conflicts make it more pressing than ever to ensure that responders are equipped with advanced tools that not only enhance their capabilities, but also protect their lives and increase operational efficiency in extreme environments. These crises demand a new level of preparedness and resilience, where autonomous systems using cutting-edge technologies work in unison to support swift, coordinated, and safe responses.\nIn light of the ongoing conflicts and the complex, high-risk environments they present, this topic focuses on developing and deploying advanced autonomous systems specifically tailored for large-scale, multi-dimensional disasters and tailored to the challenges of conflict driven. These disasters, exacerbated by geopolitical conflict, severe infrastructure damage, and immediate safety threats to both civilians and responders, demand innovative and resilient solutions. The topic seeks to address the EU’s critical need for tools that protect infrastructure, services, and populations while enhancing resilience and operational readiness.\nThrough rigorous real-world testing and capacity-building programs, responders will be trained to integrate and manage these autonomous systems effectively, preparing them for rapid deployment in high-stakes scenarios. The project will focus on delivering innovative, durable, and efficient technological solutions that allow responding effectively to crises similar in complexity and danger in environments similar to the one of the war in Ukraine. By developing tools that address the unique operational and safety challenges posed by such scenarios, this topic will reinforce the EU’s preparedness to protect both citizens and first responders, ensuring swift, coordinated responses to complex crises across Europe and beyond.\nWithin this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances.",

      "scope": "In post-conflict areas, lives of civilians are in danger and the return of economic activity is hindered because the land is contaminated by anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance. The EU provides a continuous support to humanitarian demining activities in heavily mine-affected countries and regions all over the world, thus promoting peace, security, post-conflict reconstruction, as well as social and economic rehabilitation. In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance.\nHumanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict.\nVarious humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other unexploded ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts.\nProposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects [1] . Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education.\nActivities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way.\nTo ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.\nWithin this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs.\n[1] Such the TIRAMISU and DBOX projects funded under FP7; projects MUNIMAP, BASTA, ExPloTect; project(s) funded under HORIZON-CL3-2023-BM-01-02 – “Identify, inspect, neutralise Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) at sea”; project(s) funded under EMFAF-2023-PIA-FLAGSHIP-MUNITION – “Regional flagship projects supporting a sustainable blue economy in EU sea basins – submerged munitions in the Baltic Sea”; project(s) funded under PPPA-2024-MUNITIONS – “Saving our Seas – Reducing the danger of munitions dumped in European seas”.",

      "scope": "National Contact Points (NCPs) are support structures that have become an essential component in the implementation of successive Framework Programmes. They provide information and on-the ground advice to potential applicants and beneficiaries, through the project life cycle, in their own language, in a manner that would be impossible for the European Commission and its Agencies acting alone.\nNCPs can benefit in their work from the sharing of best practices among them. NCPs can also help to give visibility to different perspectives of all Security Research and Innovation (R&I) stakeholders and to break geographical silos by aggregating the knowledge existing in the EU Member States and regions and incorporate it to the European picture. This set-up increases the visibility of the security at EU level and across security areas.\nHowever, the security sector exhibits a remarkable geographic fragmentation, with actors operating at EU level, at national level, at regional level and even at local level. In order to acknowledge the different perspectives of all stakeholders and break geographical silos, there is a need to aggregate the knowledge existing in the Member States and Associated countries and incorporate it to the European picture.\nCooperation with national stakeholders and establishment of stronger links with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) [2] .\nThese links should help to have a more comprehensive view of the common EU security needs and solutions, to better capitalise on pan-European cooperation and funding opportunities, and to give visibility to results from EU and other research projects.\nProposals should link NCPs with national communities for research and innovation that exist already or will be established. The idea of this link is to identify capability gaps, solutions to address those gaps, and research needs at local, regional and national level and integrate them in the EU picture in collaboration with CERIS.\nIn addition, this collaboration will assist NCPs to share research opportunities coming from national research programmes and initiatives with the wider security research community at national level. This will also improve the visibility of the results achieved by national players following their participation in research projects (national or EU-funded), and in particular those which have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or which have a strong potential for uptake as a result of the interest expressed by national buyers.\nFinally, this will support the promotion of innovation uptake with financial pathways and opportunities to enable the uptake of innovative solutions stemming from EU, national or regional capacity building funds, with special emphasis on the EU Home Affairs funds (both in the parts under shared management and those under direct management by the Commission) and on the European Regional Development Fund.\nAs an output of the action, the beneficiaries should develop a model for the cooperation and enlargement of with the national research and innovation communities beyond the lifetime of the project and independent of EU security research funding. The objective is to support the establishment of self-standing national communities beyond the duration of the project.\nThe successful proposal will contribute to delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts and raise awareness of potential applicants for calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 3 – \"Civil Security for Society\". Irrespectively of their sector or discipline, project proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The project should also allow for a better flow of information relevant for the implementation of the Programme from the EU level to the national level and vice-versa, and also across Member States and Associated Countries. This includes fostering the participation of national players in EU security research and innovation fora. Particular attention should be given to results that have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or that show a strong potential for uptake because of the interest expressed by national buyers.\nProposals should link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Cluster “Civil Security for Society” building on previous initiatives from similar past projects. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. The project proposal to be funded should cover a wide range of activities related to Horizon Europe, address issues specific to the Cluster \"Civil Security for Society\" and may follow up on the work of SEREN5.\nThe network should organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles. Proposals should also take into account support activities for coordination between the respective beneficiary (NCP) and the respective National Coordination Centre [4] within the relevant Member States as applicable once the regulation mentioned above is in force.\nThe project consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.\nThe recommended duration of the project is 3 years.\n[1] https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/\n[2] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en\n[3] https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/ceris-community-european-research-and-innovation-security_en\n[4] National Coordination Centres according to regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021.",

Supporting Start-ups and SME to reach the security market and strengthen the capacity of security practitioners to uptake innovative tools from the security market.",
      "scope": "The uptake of innovation stemming from EU-funded security research is not a single-step process, and there is no single method of ensuring the market uptake of successful research results. Innovation uptake needs to be contemplated as a long process that is conditioned by a number of enabling actions to be taken before research is even planned and long after it is completed. However, market uptake and deployment of innovation by security practitioners are recurrent challenges in civil security research.\nThe EU-funded security research ecosystem has changed the traditional relationship between practitioners and solution providers. The awareness of security needs and solutions has been steadily growing at all levels during the last years, with EU funded security research and innovation projects playing a pivotal role. This awareness guarantees not only that research addresses critical needs, but also that the research investment will deliver tangible results.\nThere are several approaches to achieve a better market uptake and to ensure that innovation can pass from the realm of research to the realm of the market and eventually innovative tools to be used by security practitioners.\nIn order to support SMEs and start-ups but also practitioners to find the avenues of uptake of innovation, models and methods for transferring research to the market should be promoted. This topic aims to offer services and guidance to entities in the security ecosystem to achieve market uptake.\nThe services should be delivered to SMEs/Start-ups and Practitioners. Therefore, there would be Supply-oriented Services and Demand-oriented services.\nSome of the expected services could be open for the whole community (e.g., material online) and examples of good practices, whereas others would be provided upon specific request by an entity (on demand services). On demand services may be linked to other EU-funded actions but should not cover activities already funded from those in order to avoid double funding.\nApplicants should be able to demonstrate a proven experience in technology development and innovation in the area of security and deep knowledge on the security ecosystem.\nSuccessful candidates should be able to provide services such as:\n- Funding & procurement guidance\n- Market research / competitive landscaping / Marketplaces / Market surveys/consultations\n- Proof of concept development (for TRL 2-4)\n- Funding and tendering observatory\n- Investor search / venture building\n- Technology validation support Lab testing support (i.e., Readiness assessment, Artificial Intelligence act compliance, Machine Learning security, Ethical Legal and Societal assessment, High Performance Computing capabilities, Synthetic data generation, Access to Datasets, stress testing etc.)\n- Tech and/or entrepreneurial skills development (training)\nThe proposals should outline the methods and processes by which they intend to decide which organisations they provide support to, respecting principles such as transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination between organisations and effectiveness (impact). The project should provide suggestions for such methods and processes as deliverable to be approved by the European Commission. The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice.\nProposals should take into account the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the ongoing work of Knowledge Networks. Proposals should build to the extent possible on the outcomes of previous initiatives that foster innovation uptake (e.g., iProcureNet [1] Multirate [2] , etc). In addition, existing initiatives like Horizon Booster [3] EACTDA [4] and EAFIP [5] have some components which could be used by the successful project and to be adapted in the area of security.\nThe project has to identify and describe options for the sustainability of the services beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent scheme which will continue to offer the proposed services to the community as a self-sustainable mechanism.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\nThe project should have a maximum estimated duration of 5 years.\nThe provision of financial support to third parties in the form of grants is optional.\n[1] https://www.iprocurenet.eu/\n[2] https://www.multirate.eu/\n[3] https://www.horizonresultsbooster.eu/\n[4] https://www.eactda.eu/\n[5] https://eafip.eu/",

      "scope": "Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.\nHowever, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to\nnew customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.\nKnowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users.\nApplicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:\n- Focus on mature digital technological solutions aligned with STEP guidance [1] addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme;\n- Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries;\n- Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations;\n- Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.\nExamples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.\nThe participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.\nIt is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role [2] . Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified.\nThe projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.\nThis topic contributes to the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP [3] ) and addresses civil security technologies falling under the sectors of “Digital technologies and deep-tech innovation [4] .

      "scope": "The underlying idea of this topic is to avoid that security and disaster risk research projects obtain and prepare data that at the end of the projects is simply lost instead of being stored and shared for reuse.\nIn the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community.\nAs a follow up of the outcomes and results of the LAGO project coming from the 2021 data topic: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04: Improved access to fighting crime and terrorism research data, the successful proposal, should subsequently focus on creation and deployment of a fully functional and operational common research data repository, which will extend to cover other security research areas.\nThe LAGO project is currently developing the skeleton of how such a repository of R&I data should be created, by providing a detailed roadmap consisting of a clear set of rules, conditions and characteristics that such a consolidated database should have. This LAGO roadmap will provide technical, legal and ethical requirements for a training and testing research data repository mostly in the area of fighting crime and terrorism, but the same project will already take into account possible applications of identified solutions in different security research domains, such as infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience. The LAGO roadmap will also assess if the repository should be centralised or distributed, how to deal with \"aging\" data, how efficiently projects should exchange data among them taking into account security R&I specificities.\nBuilding on the skeleton of LAGO, the newly developed data repository will enable security community (researchers, practitioners, industry, policy makers) access the scientifically satisfactory amount of up-to-date high quality and realistic data which is or was used to develop reliable (mostly digital and based on AI but also non-digital and not linked with big data) tools, technologies and solutions in support of security research and innovation. This data repository could also be very useful for verification and validation of new innovative security solutions developed under various calls in the most recent Work Programme.\nTaking into account the complexity of the future repository, a multi-faceted approach will be needed and the proposal, apart from the roadmap’s findings developed by LAGO, should also build on, and not duplicate, LAGO’s outcomes regarding the following aspects:\n- What exact types of data should be stored in the repository;\n- Interoperability with existing operational systems;\n- Interoperability/compatibility with European open science cloud (EOSC), with the TESSERA project [1] as well as other potentially relevant architectures and initiatives such as European Data Spaces or GAIA-X;\n- How to search for data;\n- Data models for security research - Harmonising of data formats;\n- Concept of operations for the use of the repository by/during EU-funded security R&I projects, modalities of use, user profiles/schemes, etc.\n- Legal issues, avoidance of any bias, accessibility levels related to the sensitivity of various data sets, solutions for annotation as well as for the aging of the data, etc.\nThe proposal should carry out extensive testing and evaluation (verification and validation), in close cooperation with ongoing projects, which would access the repository, populate it and use data intensively during the project implementation.\nThe proposal should develop an exploitation and sustainability plan following up the planning activities of LAGO, including funding instruments to be used for the operationalisation of the repository developed under the project as well as finding possibilities to maintain the repository after the lifetime of the project so that it not only continues to well function but is able to be extended with new data. The data repository will need to grow so it will have to be treated as an ongoing system. Co-ordination with already existing platforms or communities already using another reliable domain-specific data repository/ies for archiving and sharing research data is strongly recommended in order to verify if it would be possible to adhere in the future to a larger system or infrastructure of repositories such as European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for example and other relevant activities.\nAdopting sound security practices, such as developing comprehensive access rules to allow only authorized users with a legitimate need to access, modify, or transmit data, are crucial. Combined with a digital signature approach or multi-factor authentication, access rules go a long way in keeping sensitive data stored in a data repository secure. These and other security measures, such as the anonymisation of personal data, will enable the research community to fully leverage large volumes of data without introducing unnecessary security risks.\nThe repository developed by the proposal should preserve research data relevant to various security research domains, such as fighting crime and terrorism, infrastructure resilience, border management or disaster resilience across time and help security research community easily find, access and re-use the necessary data. The development and the functioning of the repository will be based on the outcomes of the roadmap from the LAGO project [2] from 2021 FCT call project within the remits of Horizon Europe regulation (including ethics). The repository should be operational to be tested for at least one year before the project ends. Data sharing will be based on open science principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). To make data FAIR, the basics of good Research Data Management will have to be applied.\nAll necessary system features as well as the functioning of the repository should comply with privacy and data protection requirements when handling data, in order to facilitate data management ensuring full access to the data actually needed (in line with the necessity and proportionality principle and in full respect of fundamental rights and applicable legislation.\nProjects should take into account, during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code, such as those resulting from projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 on the development of community-based approaches.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\nThe project should have a maximum estimated duration of 3 years.\n[1] TESSERA project: ‘Towards the datasets for the European Security Data Space for Innovation’.

      "scope": "As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&D) services and innovative civil security technology solutions.\nProposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals must include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project.\nThe proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies . The proposals should provide clear evidence to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It must be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project. The tendering process must be well-defined, supported by a draft plan, and include readiness of documentation and administrative procedures to ensure a compliant launch of the call for R&D services under PCP rules.\nProposals must demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations conducted under previous CSA projects may be used, provided they ensured procurement viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will:\n- procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP.\n- launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions.\n- adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open-source solutions).\n- foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).\nIn these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP [1] . In the first case, the procurers must foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers must foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users to adopt the solutions, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000.\nApplicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:\n- A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.\n- Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals should outline clear plans for post-PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme, the topic allows public buyers to use the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not yet in place at the proposal stage, the call requires proposers to include a deliverable outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow-up deployment or procurement after the PCP.\n- Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;\n- Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.\n- Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.\nThe applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\n[1] see General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.",

      "scope": "The security of the implementations of PQC algorithms is vital for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of digital information and communications in the face of implementation attacks, such as, for example, side-channel attacks using information from timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, fault attacks disturbing the secure of operation of the device and their combination. Such attacks, eventually also enhanced by the use of deep learning, constitute significant threats to both (embedded and regular) software and hardware implementations. In various application areas such as IoT, cloud-based applications, automotive, measures to prevent such attacks currently lead to substantial resource overhead due to the complexity of the algorithms, and the security remains unclear given the limited exploration of different attack surfaces. Countermeasures, to the extent that they are available, may have significant impact on run-time and memory consumption. Resistance in PQC implementations to implementation attacks is an increasingly common concern among customers, especially when exploring the right balance between security and performance.\nEvaluating the security of PQC algorithm implementations against side-channel and fault attacks is crucial, given the proven vulnerabilities. Various countermeasures, such as masking, shuffling, randomized clocking, random delay insertion, constant weight encoding, code polymorphism, control-flow integrity and re-computation of critical operations can be employed to mitigate these attacks. Synergies between specific countermeasures and the design of cryptographic systems are available for pre-quantum cryptography but require investigation for post-quantum cryptography.\nProposals are welcome on developing solutions that protect against such implementation attacks, at reasonable costs and minimizing the loss of performance while maintaining the required security, as well as on the analysis of new attacks or combinations of attacks, also powered by the use of AI, for security-by-design approaches when designing Post Quantum Cryptographic systems. Activities can also lead to the development of testing methodologies and frameworks for automated security evaluations for correctness and resistance to remote side-channel attacks for regular software and for correctness and resistance to a broad range of implementation attacks for embedded software and hardware.",

These should consider legal aspects of EU and national regulation as well as ethical and privacy aspects.",
      "scope": "The use of Artificial intelligence is becoming indispensable with applications where massive data is involved. Understanding all implications for cybersecurity requires deeper analysis and further research and innovation.\nGenerative AI presents both opportunities and challenges in the field of cybersecurity. This topic supports the research on new opportunities brought by Generative AI for Cybersecurity applications, to develop, train and test AI models to scale up detection of threats and vulnerabilities, enhance response time, cope with the large quantities of data involved, and automate process and decision-making support; for example by generating reports from threat intelligence data, suggesting and writing detection rules, threat hunts, and queries for the Security information and event management (SIEM), creating management, audit and compliance reports and reverse engineering malware.\nProposals addressing expected outcome a)\n(a) (i) Advanced threat and anomaly detection and analysis : Current cybersecurity tools may struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cyber attackers. Developing, training and testing of Generative AI models can be used to analyse large volumes of data and accurately identify anomalies and deviations from normal patterns of behaviour, enabling more effective threat detection, analysis and response.\nTools should also support cybersecurity professionals as they may struggle to detect and respond to threats posed by generative AI, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from genuine human activity.\n(a) (ii) Adaptive security measures : Cybersecurity tools often rely on static rules and signatures to detect threats, making them less effective against new and evolving attack methods. In addition, many cybersecurity tools still rely on manual intervention for threat response, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. Generative AI, through development, training, finetuning and testing of Generative AI models can support these tools to adapt and respond to emerging threats in real-time, improving overall security posture.\n(a) (iii) Enhanced authentication and access control : The use of AI technologies could improve resilience of authentication and access control systems to unauthorized access and credential theft, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or systems.\nProposals addressing expected outcome b)\n(b) (i) Development of tools powered by Generative AI that analyse and facilitate the Application of the national and EU regulation in digital systems , in particular the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2) and the Cyber Resilience Act.\n(b) (ii) Adaptation to a dynamic environment . Companies, public sector and organisations face an ever-changing environment which makes keeping up with compliance towards cybersecurity rules challenging. On one hand there’s a variety of rules applicable at sectorial, national or European level to be considered. On the other, change management and updates in ICT systems in organisations is frequent. Addressing both facets with tools powered with Generative AI brings the potential for a compliance continuum within organisations otherwise limited in time when driven by human intervention only.\nAll proposals are expected to respect Trustworthy and Responsible AI principles [1] and data privacy.\nAll proposals should demonstrate the EU added value by fostering the development of EU technology, the use of open-source technologies when technically and economically feasible, the exploitation of available EU data (Data Spaces, EOSC, federated data etc)\nProposals should define key performance indicators (KPI), with baseline targets to measure progress and to demonstrate how the proposed work will bring significant advancement to the state-of-the-art. All technologies and tools developed should be appropriately documented, to support take-up and replicability. Participation of SMEs is encouraged.\nProposals are expected to pay special attention to the Intellectual Property dimension of the results.

      "expected_outcome": "The use of and dependence on information and communication technologies have become fundamental aspects in all sectors of the economy. Public administrations, companies and citizens are more interconnected and interdependent across sectors and borders than ever before. This higher uptake of digital technologies increases exposure to cyber security incidents, vulnerabilities and their potential impacts. At the same time, Member States are facing growing cybersecurity risks and an overall complex threat landscape, with a clear risk of rapid spill-over of cyber incidents from one Member State to others.\nMoreover, cyber operations are increasingly integrated in hybrid and warfare strategies, with significant effects on the target. In particular, the current geopolitical context is being accompanied by a strategy of hostile cyber operations, which is a game changer for the perception and assessment of the EU’s collective cybersecurity crisis management preparedness and a call for urgent action. The threat of a possible large-scale incident causing significant disruption and damage to critical infrastructure and data spaces demands heightened preparedness at all levels of the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem. In recent years, the number of cyberattacks has increased dramatically, including supply chain attacks aiming at cyberespionage, ransomware, or disruption. The vulnerability landscape is also threatening. The ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2024 [1] counts a total of 19,754 vulnerabilities. This amount of vulnerabilities can’t be manually managed by humans. There is a need for automated management of vulnerabilities based on established standards like the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) [2] .\nAs regards detection of cyber threats and incidents, there is an urgent need to increase the exchange of information and improve our collective capabilities in order to reduce drastically the time needed to detect cyber threats and mitigate, before they can cause large-scale damage and costs. While many cybersecurity threats and incidents have a potential cross-border dimension, due to the interconnection of digital infrastructures, the sharing of relevant information among Member States remains limited. Proposals are expected to address this emerging threat landscape with the development of advanced frameworks, services tools, and processes, in line with relevant EU legislation (NIS2, Cyber Resilience Act, Cyber Solidarity Act).\nLastly, focus should be given to developing innovative frameworks, technologies, tools, processes, and services that reinforce cybersecurity capabilities for operational and technical cybersecurity cooperation, in line with relevant EU policy, with particular focus on NIS2, Cyber Solidarity Act and the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as legal and ethical requirements.\nProposals should address at least two of the following expected outcomes:\n- Enhanced Situational Awareness through advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence frameworks, tools, and services as well as cybersecurity risk assessments of critical supply chains made in the EU,\n- Frameworks, tools, and services for preparedness against Cyber and Hybrid Threats in information and communication technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT), including cybersecurity exercises,\n- Expanded Security Operations Centre/Computer Security Incident Response Teams (SOC/CSIRT) functionality through advanced tools and services for detection, analysis, incident handling including response and reporting as well as remediation,\n- Development of testing and experimentation facilities for advanced tools and processes for operational cybersecurity, including the creation of digital twins for critical infrastructures and essential and important entities as defined in NIS2,\n- Development and pilot implementation of cross-sector and/or cross-border cyber crisis management frameworks, services, and tools,\n- Frameworks, services, and tools aimed at mechanisms and processes for enhanced operational cooperation between public sector entities (CSIRT network, EU-CyCLONe). Extension of the above to essential and important entities as defined in NIS2 [3] , would be an advantage.",
      "scope": "Proposals are expected to demonstrate the developed frameworks, tools, services, and processes through pilot implementations involving the participation of relevant national cybersecurity authorities and/or essential and important entities as defined in NIS2, implemented with the participation of leading European cybersecurity industry. Proposals should consider the impact of forthcoming legislation, in particular the Cyber Resilience Act.\nReal world applications and the usability of the solutions developed should feature predominately in the proposals.\nThe participation of the following types of entities is highly encouraged: innovative European cybersecurity start-ups and SMEs with a proven track-record in cybersecurity innovation at EU level (e.g. active participation in successful EU funded projects including cybersecurity projects under Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme cybersecurity projects or EIC Pathfinder or Accelerator projects), European start-ups and SMEs that can demonstrate established operational cooperation with relevant National Cybersecurity Authorities, European start-ups and SMEs that have received equity investments by national, European or private Venture Capital funds for cybersecurity activities etc. The participation of these start-ups and SMEs with an active role in the implementation of the proposed action (project coordination, technical coordination, lead of pilot implementation etc) would be considered an asset.\n[1] The ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2024: ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2024: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2024\n[2] Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF): https://csaf.io/\n[3] Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555",

      "scope": "Protecting individuals' personal data and ensuring privacy while allowing for data processing and analysis is fundamental for our society. Privacy-preserving techniques allow to minimize the amount of personal data collected and processed, and to protect that data through advanced cryptographic methods. For instance, machine-learning methodologies are leveraged to dissect medical and behavioural data, aiming to unearth causations and insights into cyber attacks or threats. However, a substantial portion of this data comprises personal information, (such as sensitive health data), raising concerns over potential breaches or misuse, thus jeopardizing the privacy of individuals, societal well-being, and economic stability.\nIn addition, the challenges related to the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets, which could impede the full realization of the data-driven economy, are also subject to the work that can be proposed under this topic. Solutions that can provide security against quantum adversaries are also encouraged.\nPrivacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic anonymous credentials, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, advanced digital signatures, such as ring signatures, blind signatures and attribute-based credentials hold promise in mitigating these challenges, yet their practical application necessitates further refinement and rigorous testing. Consortia are encouraged to propose solutions that can improve the usability and effectiveness of different PETs in realistic environment and to investigate their integration within common European data spaces. The inclusion of agile schemes designed in a modular way to support the transition to post-quantum PETs and the design, improvement and security analysis of quantum-resistant PETs is welcome, in light of the advances of quantum technologies.\nProposals should also focus on enhancing the usability, scalability, and dependability of secure and PETs within supply chains, while seamlessly integrating with existing infrastructures and conventional security protocols. They should also accommodate the diversity in data types and models across various organizations, undergoing validation and pilot runs within authentic data environments. Adherence to data regulations, notably GDPR, is paramount.\nConsortia should seek to intertwine interdisciplinary expertise and resources from industry stakeholders, service providers, and end-users. The engagement of SMEs is encouraged, alongside the inclusion of legal proficiency to ensure regulatory compliance, including GDPR adherence. Furthermore, proactive identification and assessment of potential regulatory hurdles and constraints for the developed technologies/solutions are strongly encouraged.",

      "scope": "The intrinsic security of PQC algorithms is based on mathematical problems that are believed to be intractable for both classical and quantum computers. To assess the quantum security of post-quantum primitives is fundamental in order to boost our confidence on post-quantum cryptosystems. The development of quantum algorithms demonstrating a significant quantum speed-up would represent a major breakthrough, necessitating a reassessment of the security of cryptosystems (lattice-based, code-based, and others). Conversely, if no significant quantum speed-up is discovered, it would bolster our confidence in the security of these post-quantum cryptosystems, though some parameters may still require fine-tuning. Moreover, up to now existing quantum attackers have been analyzed mostly in a theoretical way. However, their application to nowadays cryptosystems fail due to a lack of efficient implementations and hardware. Studies are also needed on AI-based approaches that may be used to attack certain schemes with certain implementation choices, and the discovery of eventual vulnerabilities can help the research community develop more robust post-quantum cryptosystems.\nProposals on the assessment of the security of post-quantum primitives, via studies focused on eventual quantum algorithms with demonstrable speed-up, eventually also in combination with AI, or on solely AI-based approaches, are welcome. The security of lattice and code-based PQC algorithms may be prioritized, but tackling other mathematical problem classes is not excluded. As the unprecedented computational power of quantum computing can greatly enhance AI capabilities, combination of different approaches may also be considered. Consortia with team of applicants with background in post-quantum cryptography and in quantum computing are particularly encouraged. Projects should lead to identification of vulnerabilities of current post-quantum cryptographic building blocks and to practical recommendations for parameters for the design of post-quantum cryptosystems with improved security against quantum attacks and future advances in code-breaking and AI.",

      "scope": "The security of the implementations of PQC algorithms is vital for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of digital information and communications in the face of implementation attacks, such as, for example, side-channel attacks using information from timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, fault attacks disturbing the secure of operation of the device and their combination. Such attacks, eventually also enhanced by the use of deep learning, constitute significant threats to both (embedded and regular) software and hardware implementations. In various application areas such as IoT, cloud-based applications, automotive, measures to prevent such attacks currently lead to substantial resource overhead due to the complexity of the algorithms, and the security remains unclear given the limited exploration of different attack surfaces. Countermeasures, to the extent that they are available, may have significant impact on run-time and memory consumption. Resistance in PQC implementations to implementation attacks is an increasingly common concern among customers, especially when exploring the right balance between security and performance.\nEvaluating the security of PQC algorithm implementations against side-channel and fault attacks is crucial, given the proven vulnerabilities. Various countermeasures, such as masking, shuffling, randomized clocking, random delay insertion, constant weight encoding, code polymorphism, control-flow integrity and re-computation of critical operations can be employed to mitigate these attacks. Synergies between specific countermeasures and the design of cryptographic systems are available for pre-quantum cryptography but require investigation for post-quantum cryptography.\nProposals are welcome on developing solutions that protect against such implementation attacks, at reasonable costs and minimizing the loss of performance while maintaining the required security, as well as on the analysis of new attacks or combinations of attacks, also powered by the use of AI, for security-by-design approaches when designing Post Quantum Cryptographic systems. Activities can also lead to the development of testing methodologies and frameworks for automated security evaluations for correctness and resistance to remote side-channel attacks for regular software and for correctness and resistance to a broad range of implementation attacks for embedded software and hardware.",

      "scope": "The transition to post-quantum cryptography requires changing the uses of most currently deployed public-key cryptography (RSA and ECC). Research and development efforts are providing signature systems and key-exchange mechanisms that are generally accepted to withstand attacks using classical and quantum computers. Efforts are on the way to include these in core Internet protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this is an important development, many more protocols need to be modified to be quantum-ready and to ensure backward compatibility with legacy systems. Various application areas, such as Internet of Things, cloud-based applications, and automotive, place constraints on bandwidth or processing time which may prompt different choices than those employed for TLS. Currently used high-level protocols may have components that are specific to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or to Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) or may require additional building blocks next to or in place of signatures and key-exchange mechanisms. While applications that provide authenticity are less urgent to migrate than those for confidentiality, those using embedded hardware such as secure elements, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using hardware tokens and others have a very slow turnover and need to be replaced by the time large quantum computers exist, thus requiring migrating the design in the near future.\nActivities should target one or multiple relevant high-level protocols and produce their post-quantum versions. Typically, this can be achieved through combining current and post-quantum solutions for backward compatibility. Atypical solutions with equivalent security are also welcome. Consortia composed by actors of different nature, such as, for example, research institutions, relevant public entities, and industry to ensure that PQC solutions meet real-world security demands and are robustly tested across various applications are also welcome.",

Proposals should focus on development of solutions for grid and/or storage technologies, which can highly improve their sustainability, resilience, and overall energy security performance in the European context in the long run. Proposals should take into consideration the results of the Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and beyond [1] .\nProject should address precisely only one of the following areas:\nArea 1- Advanced tools to address cybersecurity risks to 1) energy system transmission and distribution and 2) renewables to storage and storage to energy network interface technologies;\nArea 2- Increasing circular economy processes, recycling, re-use or substitution of sustainably supplied critical materials and electronics for energy network and storage technologies;\nArea 3- Sustainability and public perception of energy network and storage technologies as a limiting factor for their required capacity build-up and efficient performance in a secure energy system (e.g., hydropower, CAES storage).\nFurthermore, a framework for decent working conditions, most notably essential skills, and efficient skills management within the overall energy network and storage system are essential for inclusivity and competitiveness of these systems. They should be addressed as an important transversal value chain component.\n[1] European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Schleker, T., Hicks, M., Cressida Howard, I. et al., Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and beyond final report , Schleker, T.(editor), Publications Office of the European Union, 2024, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/906828",

Consortia should include the respective system operators, service providers, technology providers, potential financial actors and other relevant stakeholders.\nThe project should produce practical, operationally useful knowledge on cross-regional strategies for combining a variety of clean flexibility LDES solutions/technologies and cross-sector integration, focusing on the optimal combination of LDES with RES production sites, industrial complexes and districts (e.g. co-location and hybridisation), to support the grid.\nThis topic will analyse the overall system value of integration of LDES (>12h) in the energy system under different future decarbonisation pathways, assessing the impact on operation and planning of energy infrastructure costs as well as security of supply, system reliability and resiliency.\nThe scope is to maximise the benefit of LDES integration within the context of system wide optimisation of long-term grid enhancement strategies. This encompasses relevant, validated historical data sets, visualisation, scenario analysis, model sensitivity analysis and data set optimisation, optimal use of previously developed models and digital twins, cyber security, use of open-source solutions and free licensing.\nThe project is expected to identify technical and regulatory barriers, and propose possible recommendations and policy actions, to promote the best solutions tackling these barriers and support replication of the solutions.",

Agricultural, forest and industrial biogenic waste resources may offer significant potential for bio-based hydrogen production. R&I in this area has been identified as a priority by the EU-India Trade and Technology Council’s Working Group on Green and Clean Energy Technology to reinforce bilateral cooperation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Renewable hydrogen producers and consumers based in the EU and India benefit from improved sustainability, safety, and affordability of renewable hydrogen production technologies from biogenic wastes (compared to existing ones);\n- Technology developers based in the EU and India benefit from the expanded portfolio of renewable hydrogen production concepts through biogenic wastes use;\n- Stakeholders on renewable hydrogen production based in the EU and India benefit from each other’s experience on renewable hydrogen from biogenic wastes;\n- The cooperation between EU and India key researchers, institutions and industries which are active in biogenic waste to renewable hydrogen research is supported and strengthened.",
      "scope": "The topic aims at developing innovative technologies to produce renewable hydrogen from biogenic wastes without recycling potential such as agricultural, forest and biogenic part of municipal wastes, sewage sludge and industrial waste waters, through biochemical and thermochemical Waste to renewable Hydrogen (W2rH) pathways. Focus will be on increasing the resource efficiency (carbon to hydrogen yield), reducing the GHG emissions or even generating a negative carbon footprint, decreasing environmental footprint for pollution and water consumption, and significantly reducing the production cost of hydrogen. Use of advanced catalysts to enhance primary conversion or upgrading of the intermediate from primary conversion or process intensification methods including advanced reactor technologies are in the scope. Utilisation of side streams such as aqueous and gaseous streams from primary conversion and/or their further conversion using biological, electrochemical, biochemical and/or catalytic technologies are in the scope as well. Development of feedstock pretreatment methods including sorting and post-treatment technologies required for hydrogen purification could be included in the projects.\nAn assessment of the feedstock cost supply at regional and local level suitable for the selected conversion technology and improvement of feedstock mobilisation patterns including via enabling technologies, such as digitalisation, should be performed. Preliminary economic feasibility as well as socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the developed concept including assessing potential impacts on land use, water use, biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as social impacts, are expected to be assessed by the project on a life-cycle analysis basis. The production cost of the W2rH pathway should be compared to the state-of-the art production technologies of renewable hydrogen and with aim to be reduced. Projects should develop an overall process concept using advanced modelling techniques including flowsheet modelling for mass and energy flows.\nSafety aspects and ways to increase safety concerning the hydrogen and other gaseous and system component leakages are expected to be addressed in a ‘hydrogen safety planning and management’ plan at the project level. Project developers are encouraged to contact the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP) [1] established under the Clean Hydrogen Partnership to benefit from the developed experience in safety issues for hydrogen systems. The projects should lead to commercially viable and economically interesting pathways when upscaled.\nOrganic waste being not biogenic is not in the scope of the call.\nThe exploitation of results, including IPR, should be appropriately addressed in the proposal.\nJoint work should benefit from the Indian and European experience in W2rH. Linked EU and Indian projects should have the same start date, the same duration, and same targets. Proposals must show clearly how the coordination among them will bring added scientific value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects a genuine EU-Indian cooperation, linked projects should include properly coordinated research activities between EU and India in the Work Plan of the two coordinated projects.\nProposals will include detailed explanations about tasks and effort of the coordinated proposal as a whole and cross-references to the e proposal for the linked project.\nThis topic aims at exploiting synergies between India and Europe in terms of scientific expertise and resources in topics related to W2rH production by implementing coordinated projects. Potential areas for collaboration (i.e. the coordinated part of the call) could include (but are not limited to) optimising fermentation and thermochemical processes, developing new catalysts, and improving separation techniques, as well as assessment of sustainability, technoeconomic feasibility and safety aspects including by using advanced process modelling.\nThe topic falls within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in relation to waste to renewable hydrogen. For the purposes of this topic, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy of the Government of India (MNRE) has made the required funding available for the coordinated projects of the Indian side [2] . A balanced effort and matched budget between Europe and India regarding the two coordinated projects are expected.\nIn order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects under this topic, proposals selected for funding under this topic will be required to participate in common networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities, proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance of joint meetings periodically.\n[1] https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/get-involved/european-hydrogen-safety-panel-0_en\n[2] Ministry of New and Renewable Energy website: https://www.mnre.gov.in ; MNRE R&D Portal: https://research.mnre.gov.in",

      "scope": "The Clean Energy Transition co-funded Partnership (CET Partnership) is a transnational initiative on joint R&I programming to boost and accelerate the energy transition, building upon regional and national R&I funding programmes.\nIt aims at empowering the energy transition and contributing to the EU goal of becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, by pooling national and regional R&I funding for a broad variety of technologies and system solutions required to achieve the transition. It will foster innovation ecosystems from the very local and regional level, up to the transnational European level, thus overcoming a fragmented European landscape. The CET Partnership enables national and regional R&I programme owners and managers from Member States and Associated Countries to align their priorities and implement annual joint calls from 2022 to 2027. The Partnership also organises joint accompanying activities to enable a dynamic learning process, extracts strategic knowledge and accelerates the upscaling, replication, and market diffusion of innovative solutions to maximise impact and foster the uptake of cost-effective clean energy technologies.\nThe common vision of the CET Partnership is already expressed in its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that has been co-created with the involved countries, the EU SET Plan Implementation Working Groups and ETIPs, all energy relevant ERA-Nets as well as the EERA joint programmes (over 500 editors, co-authors, commenters, and discussants). The SRIA articulates the common goal of (1) building a transnational transformative Joint Programming Platform, (2) developing and demonstrating technology and solutions for the transition of energy systems, and finally (3) building innovation ecosystems that support capacity building at all levels.\nThe objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Clean Energy Transition Co-fund Partnership identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nThe new geopolitical and energy market realities require to drastically accelerate the clean energy transition and increase energy independence from unreliable suppliers and volatile fossil fuels. In support to the objectives of REPowerEU [1] it is expected that the partnership explores pathways and develops new actions to reinforce R&I investments (and utilisation of R&I results) accelerating the clean energy transition.\nIt is expected that the European Clean Energy Transition Co-Fund Partnership reinforces its ambition considering the revised SET Plan and continues the implementation of its SRIA by setting up joint calls in 2025, 2026 and 2027. In addition, the partnership is invited to setup joint calls without co-funding from the European Union.\nThe consortium that won the grant under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. With regards to the various activities already undertaken in previous years, no other consortium is able to continue the activities of the Partnership underway without a significant disruption of the ongoing activities.\nWhile the grant under this topic should be attributed to a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04, the consortium applying to the present topic may include additional partners and new activities, to be funded by the grant subject to an evaluation, which will take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation (as relevant), and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\n[1] REPowerEU: affordable, secure and sustainable energy for Europe | European Commission (europa.eu)",

      "expected_outcome": "In 2015, the launch of the Energy Union saw the SET Plan (Strategic Energy Technology Plan) incorporated as the Energy Union’s fifth pillar on ‘Research, Innovation and Competitiveness’. With the 2023 Communication on the revision of the SET Plan, its strategic objectives were harmonised with the European Green Deal, REPowerEU and the Green Deal Industrial Plan. Moreover, the SET Plan became a structural policy under the European Research Area. In 2024, the SET Plan was enshrined in the Net Zero Industry Act and the SET Plan Steering Group was established as a high-level expert group.\nDepending on the sector, European Technology and Innovation Platforms (ETIPs), and/or SET Plan Implementation Working Groups (IWGs) and/or similar stakeholder fora support the development and implementation of the SET Plan priorities by bringing together relevant stakeholders in key areas from industry, research organisations and, where applicable, SET Plan countries’ government representatives.\nIt is crucial for the clean energy transition that the SET Plan stakeholder fora align and coordinate their activities.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\n- European climate and energy policies are supported by science-based evidence.\n- The implementation of the SET Plan and its contribution to the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Net Zero Industry Act and the European Research Area are facilitated.\n- The SET Plan stakeholder fora are recognised as key players in the clean energy transition.\n- The societal and economic effects of the clean energy transition are addressed through the consideration of interests, needs and concerns of end users and actors across the value chain of the respective technology sectors.",

Special attention should be given, as appropriate, to the key challenges of the European Green Deal, the Green Deal Industrial Plan and the Net Zero Industry Act, including (but not limited to) energy security, technological pushback, industrial production and competitiveness, supply chain security and dependencies, access to market, circularity, advanced materials, digitalisation, societal transformation, skills, and just transition. Moreover, as appropriate, the projects are expected to address the contribution to the goals of the European Research Area in the field of energy, in particular the achievement of the 3% GDP target of public and private spending on research and innovation.\nThe stakeholder fora should ensure the participation of industrial players (including SMEs), research and civil society organisations, universities and European associations representing relevant sectors (as applicable) across several SET Plan countries, establishing links with national authorities. To maximise impact, the projects are encouraged to develop and implement robust outreach approaches to widen participation from across the EU and associated countries. As appropriate, societal needs and interests should be considered in the activities of the fora, so that inequalities and employment issues are addressed. Where applicable, the stakeholder fora should establish synergies with relevant Horizon Europe European Partnerships.\nThe projects are encouraged to implement dissemination and networking activities with other relevant projects (e.g., joint workshops, thematic conferences, webinar series, regular exchanges, etc.).\nRelevant outputs of the projects will feed into the SET Plan information system (SETIS), the annual SET Plan progress report and the Commission’s Clean Energy Technology Observatory. As appropriate, the projects should provide data and analysis tracking the progress of the different technologies towards the EU targets, for instance those set out by the Net Zero Industry Act (e.g., the implementation of non-price criteria), the Critical Raw Materials Act, and the Renewable Energy Directive (e.g., the target for innovative renewable energy technologies to represent at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030). Data should be accessible and reusable according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Reusable, Interoperable). The projects are expected to contribute to the reporting of the SET Plan to the European Parliament and the Council.\nThe projects should prepare new (or update existing) finance and sustainability plans for future continuation of the stakeholder fora without EU funding.\nIf relevant, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThe indicative project duration is two years.",

This instrument allows for testing of innovative net-zero technologies in real-world environment for a limited amount of time and with a view of potential scaling up and further wider deployment. Those innovative technologies could eventually be essential to achieve the Union’s climate neutrality objective and to ensure the security of supply and resilience of the Union’s energy system. Regulatory sandboxes contribute to better regulation [3] and to the New European Innovation Agenda’s [4] flagship on experimentation spaces.\nAccording to the Regulation, Member States designate one or more contact points for setting up net zero regulatory sandboxes and the net zero Europe Platform is assigned to coordinate Member States’ activities and cooperation on net zero regulatory sandboxes. For the wider and accelerated deployment of innovative net-zero technologies it is crucial that the assigned contact points and competent authorities coordinate their activities, exchange information on lessons learnt and good practices and cooperate, including possible cross-border implementation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\n- Regulatory learning of how regulation supports or hampers the enhanced use of innovative net-zero technologies;\n- Net zero regulatory sandboxes schemes are well established, streamlined and designed;\n- The net zero Europe Platform actively and smoothly exchanges information among Member States (contact points and competent authorities) and stakeholders thanks to the support of the project.",

Proposals should also expressly identify whether they are addressing the area of (i) shallow geothermal; (ii) deep geothermal; or (iii) both shallow and deep geothermal.\nDrilling and subsurface engineering account for a large part of the costs of geothermal projects, and on-field project development contains significant risks due to inherent geological uncertainties. Reducing costs upfront, improving performance, estimating uncertainty, and reducing risk can therefore boost the geothermal capacity deployment rate.\nThe scope covers advances beyond the state of the art in one/several of the following points:\n- subsurface engineering;\n- well design, drilling and completion;\n- reservoir characterisation and development planning.\nProposals should include one or more of the following: robot and AI-physics-based simulation solutions for geothermal resource development, novel cost-efficient drilling methods and equipment, advanced drilling fluids, new materials for casing, cementing and completion, working fluids, logging while drilling, wireline technologies and geosteering high temperature electronics, well architecture and stimulation, closed loop technology, enhanced production pumps, and innovative monitoring systems during geothermal resources exploitation including their integration in digital twins.\nProposals are expected to reduce project development time while ensuring safety of operations and adaptation to specific geothermal environments (including offshore), constraining and quantifying geological uncertainties, reducing field development and seismic risks. They can include standardisation of the drilling equipment enhanced well production, enhanced environmental performance, improve component resistance to corrosion, scaling, high temperature, wear, and mechanical failures, increase energy extraction.\nThe project must include a clear go/no-go milestone ahead of entering the demonstration phase of the project. Before this go/no-go milestone, delivery of the detailed engineering plans, a techno-economic assessment, and all needed permits for the demonstrator should be foreseen. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and timeline to obtaining the permits.\nEnvironmental impact of the proposal should be assessed, and mitigation measures considered.\nWhere relevant, the project is expected to follow FAIR data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures.\nIn order to enhance the benefits of the technology, proposals are expected to develop understandings of how the utilisation of geothermal resources aligns with the cultural values and contextual settings at local to regional level and increase the responsiveness of geothermal energy to diverse societal interests and concerns. To achieve that, an inclusive, early and continuous societal engagement should be enhanced.\nIn particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (applied to social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.",

Material quality, process technologies, and solar cell architectures have improved significantly in recent decades, and solar cell efficiencies are now approaching 27%, thus close to the theoretical limit. However, challenges remain in several aspects, such as increasing the production yield, stability, reliability, cost, and sustainability.\nThe ingot and wafering production steps are power intensive and produce recyclable waste in the form of kerf slurry – the residue ingot material from between the sliced wafers. These production steps are highly concentrated in China.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- A European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing environmental impact and strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;\n- Scaling-up solar PV manufacturing capacity in Europe for an accelerated solar PV deployment, supporting Europe’s decarbonisation targets;\n- Reduced energy and material consumption and lower carbon and environmental footprint for crystalline silicon PV products along their lifecycle;\n- The execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda [1] .",
      "scope": "Due to their efficiency and durability, crystalline silicon wafers are by far the most common absorber material used in the production of solar cells and modules today. These wafers are primarily made using either a directional solidification that produces large-grained multi-crystalline (mc-Si) wafers with a greater defect density (and therefore almost out of production) or a solar-optimised Czochralski (Cz) growing method that produces crystalline silicon with low defect density (c-Si). In addition, “kerfless” silicon wafers can be grown directly either from molten silicon or from gaseous epitaxial deposition on a low-cost substrate at high temperature. To facilitate continued and rapid proliferation of Si photovoltaics, realizing new, more efficient and less energy and material intensive processes for silicon feedstock, ingots and wafers is sought. Therefore, proposals are expected to address at least one of the following challenges:\n- Demonstrate alternative, efficient, and scalable (towards gigawatt capacity) processes or methods and equipment to grow silicon ingots and wafers from either liquid or gaseous phase at lower cost (with lower energy and material requirements) and high-quality compared to standard processes and possibly avoid the wafering step;\n- Optimise standard processes and equipment for defect, impurities and structure loss minimisation, high-quality ingots with large diameters (for larger wafers) that allow for higher level of automation and kerf recycling and/or use of recycled silicon from waste solar modules and reduced energy use; optimise wafering.\nProposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one silicon ingot and wafer manufacturer.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation.

      "expected_outcome": "The development of research and innovation policies, as well as general energy policies in the area of smart and integrated energy systems require a sound evidence base. The BRIDGE [1] initiative established by the European Commission brings together projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes in the areas of Smart Grids, Energy Storage, Islands, and Digitalisation. BRIDGE has a twofold objective. On the one hand, it fosters the exchange of information, experience, knowledge, and best practices among the projects. On the other hand, it provides field experience, feedback and lessons learned from the participating projects to help overcome the barriers to effective innovation. It aims at gathering coordinated, balanced and coherent recommendations presented with a single voice to policy makers, in view of successfully supporting research and innovation actions, and exploiting the results achieved by projects.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- European research and innovation policies, and energy policies in the areas of smart energy systems are supported by evidence gathered from the implementation of real-life projects.\n- Projects funded under Horizon Europe that address energy systems are informed on solutions and methodologies that were previously developed by European-funded projects and are effectively benchmarking their results and compare lessons learnt with other similar European projects.\n- Consolidation of the BRIDGE initiative and re-affirmation of its role as a recognised European reference for providing innovative solutions for the development of smart and integrated energy systems.\n- Effective and improved cooperation of BRIDGE with other European initiatives that are active in related areas (such as ETIP SNET [2] ).",
      "scope": "Proposals are expected to:\n- Provide professional support to the overall organisation of the BRIDGE initiative, its working groups and task forces. This includes organisational and logistical support for the governance of BRIDGE, e.g. for the preparation and execution of meetings and support to the activities of coordination with other EU and/or national initiatives and bodies. It also includes support to the chairs of the working group chairs in fulfilling their roles and facilitating the periodic processes for the renewal of the chairmanship.\n- Onboard new projects and maintain the database of BRIDGE members in terms of projects, implementing organisations/project partners, their membership in Working Groups and Task Forces, contact details.\n- Ensure the completion and publication of the relevant reports, studies, brochures, policy briefings etc. Three main categories of documents are envisaged: BRIDGE annual brochures [3] – are prepared by the project, updated annually and published online; Annual thematic/expert reports [4] containing policy conclusions and recommendations – are drafted by the BRIDGE working groups under the coordination of their chairmanship, as decided in their annual work programmes. The project ensures final editorial support and formatting, and their publication online; Other reports, as needed and decided by the Bridge chairmanship on a case-by-case basis.\n- Maintain the online presence of BRIDGE and ensure the related communication activities, notably through maintaining and developing its dedicated web page, distributing a periodic (online) newsletter, and posts on social media.\n- Enable BRIDGE to provide policy support to the European Commission services (mainly to DG Energy) by gathering, structuring and presenting information on technological progress, innovation, competitiveness and digitalisation in the field of smart energy systems.\n- Organise the annual BRIDGE General Assemblies, including invitations, hosting, minutes/conclusion drafting and follow up on action points. The meetings usually take place in March, usually face-to-face in Brussels with hybrid options available.\n- Manage cooperation with other relevant European initiatives, notably with the European Technology and Innovation Platform - Smart Networks for Energy Transition (ETIP SNET). Manage the representation of BRIDGE and its member projects at key events (e.g., European Sustainable Energy Week, established European fairs such as Enlit – to be decided on a case-by-case basis etc.).\nProposals submitted under this topic are encouraged to include actions designed to facilitate cooperation, across Europe, with other initiatives and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced during the project.\nThe indicative project duration is three years.\n[1] https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\n[2] https://smart-networks-energy-transition.ec.europa.eu/\n[3] As an example, see the Bridge Brochure 2023 https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/download/bridge%20cooperation%20between%20horizon%202020%20and%20horizon-MJ0423748ENN.pdf\n[4] See examples at https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/news/10-new-reports-produced-bridge-working-groups-and-task-forces-now-available-download",

      "expected_outcome": "The design and safe operation of a CO2 transport and storage system represents specific challenges as it involves CO2 streams at different flow rates, pressures and states (liquid, gaseous, super critical, dissolved in water), and with different compositions and impurities. The presence of impurities will change the chemical and thermophysical properties with respect to a pure CO2 fluid. When CO2 is transported in pipelines at conditions close to its critical temperature and pressure, the impact of impurities on the thermophysical properties can become substantial. High levels of CO2 stream purity must be achieved to avoid two-phase flow during pipeline transportation. In addition, reactive impurities can form strong acids giving unacceptable corrosion of pipelines, tubings and ships, and can impact on injectivity, well integrity and seal integrity of geological storage sites. Directive 2009/31/EC regulates that CO2 streams, while they may contain incidental associated substances from the source, capture or injection process, the concentrations of these substances should be below levels that would adversely affect the integrity of the storage site or the relevant transport infrastructure and not pose a significant risk to the environment or human health. Member States should ensure that storage site operators only accept and inject CO2 streams if a risk assessment shows that these conditions are met.\nThe Communication on Industrial Carbon Management [1] underlines the need for pre-normative research on the physical and chemical behaviour of impure CO2 in order to contribute to relevant guidelines and standardisation work. This was also emphasised in a report prepared by a stakeholder group on CO2 standards under the CCUS Forum [2] .\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Contribution to an accurate understanding of the effects of impure (and possibly corrosive) CO2 flows along the transport network (in particular pipelines and shipping) or in the storage complex in line with Art. 12 of Directive 2009/31/EC, including any engineered or geological barriers to leakage in the near-well region;\n- Inform relevant guidelines and contribute to standardisation work through improved understanding of the physical and chemical behaviour of impure CO2.",

There is a need to understand if current storage development is enough to meet EU storage requirements defined in the NZIA.\nProject results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:\n- Enhanced availability of CO 2 storage sites and transparency about potential CO 2 storage and injection capacity and infrastructure, including in relation to geomechanical characteristics and pressure interference from neighbouring storage projects, which can support market operators to plan their investments and enable the implementation of large-scale storage hubs connected to shared CO2 transport infrastructure.",
      "scope": "The project is expected to produce a digital atlas of ‘investable’ underground storage space for CO 2 in the EU and Associated Countries. The European CO 2 Storage Atlas [1] currently under revision and being updated by the GSEU project [2] , including estimated capacity and storage readiness level, presents a good basis, but also shows that data gaps need to be closed, and access to the necessary data during project implementation will be crucial. The Commission's Energy and Industry Geography Lab [3] can also be used. Proposals are expected to include the following:\n- Identify and assess with a harmonised methodology, injection and storage capacities for current and planned projects and compare with storage requirements;\n- Identify key regions for future pre-licence appraisal (high estimated capacity, proximity to emitters, transport corridors), and develop plans for pre-licence appraisal, per region;\n- Each potential storage site must be labelled according to its ‘storage readiness level’ in line with the storage readiness levels included in the GSEU atlas, and matched with public data to speed up the work to identify and assess the storage capacities and what is needed to mature understanding of the site. Furthermore, the identified potential storage sites should be compared and ranked by applying a common ranking scheme developed based on currently used ranking schemes and including a techno-economic assessment;\n- Environmental and security aspects must be taken into account.\nThe proposal is expected to explicitly demonstrate the capacity to have access to the necessary data during the implementation of the grant. Cooperation with relevant national and/or regional actors in the management of the subsurface, such as geological surveys or competent authorities, will be key.\n[1] European CO2 storage database - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] GSEU ( geologicalservice .eu)\n[3] Energy and Industry Geography Lab - European Commission (europa.eu)",

      "scope": "Wireless stationary charging for road light duty vehicles can be a solution to minimise the intrusiveness of the charging infrastructures, which is critical in urban environments. Moreover, it can provide the EV user with a hands-free way of charging, which is of particular benefit for people with disabilities or other weaknesses. The holistic system approach of EV integration into electricity grids entails bi-directional power between EV and the grid to maximise the battery capacity exploitation for grid-and market-oriented services. Recent progress on wireless bidirectionality of charging technologies motivates the need for additional demonstrations with further improved efficiency [1] . The focus of this topic is the development of the charging system, the integration of the system into the vehicle and its demonstration in real life operations. Limited optimisations concerning on-board systems not directly related to the wireless charging (e.g. BMS and battery) may be included if properly justified.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Design, develop and demonstrate cost-effective, standardised, safe, visually not intrusive, efficient technologies, solutions and user-centric services offered for bi-directional automatic wireless charging for road Light Duty Vehicles;\n- Investigate ways to maximise efficiency through charging plate and power electronic design and positioning (such as auto-positioning of vehicle and/or transmitters/receivers) to increase comfort and social responsiveness of parking and stationary charging;\n- Avoid detrimental effects from obstacles such as garbage or amounts of dirt that might interfere with the power transfer and/or might cause damage;\n- Efficient system integration of bidirectional wireless charging infrastructures and services to support Renewable Energy Sources (RES) deployment, grid balancing, and investments analysis, making use of generative AI where beneficially applicable;\n- Analyse the environmental footprint of the solution following a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach including reuse, repair and recycling/recovery, in particular to reduce use of critical raw materials, and perform a Costs-and-Benefits analysis on the development and the deployment of the proposed solutions;\n- Demonstrate solutions and services in at least three different urban areas (peri-urban and/or rural are excluded) within Horizon Europe participating countries considering different climatic conditions and for a period of at least three months;\n- Exploitation of synergies with projects related to the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future [2] is encouraged where applicable.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.\nThe project(s) should contribute to the activities of existing working groups for the definition of standards for EV wireless charging.\nThe project(s) should take account Open Science, its practices and learning, and the project’s results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data [3] .\nProposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consists of performing experimental or desk-top research on Electromagnetic Compliance and Safety.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

      "scope": "In addition to protection during a collision, it is the post-crash phase, immediately after the collision, that is crucial for the consequences of a road crash. Vehicle fires are a key concern in this post-crash phase. While there are many similarities to fires in vehicles with Internal Combustion Engines (ICEV), road electric vehicle battery fires pose a range of new challenges to emergency responders and everyone handling EVs post-incident, including tow, repair, storage, salvage & wrecking. The rescue of victims, the safety of first responders and safe, efficient, and timely firefighting measures are key factors. The latter in particular poses important challenges specific to road electric vehicles, amongst others due to the chemical composition of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, the placement of the battery in the vehicles, enclosed in a water-tight, protective compartment, and the volume of water needed to cool a burning high-capacity battery. This is a challenge in particular in constrained spaces, such as in tunnels.\nThere is a need to support the definition of standards and procedures both in terms of risk but also in terms of response. With a focus on Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), proposed actions will identify and further develop optimum technological solutions, processes and best practices towards future standards, design guidelines and official instructions / service regulations.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Vehicle health assessment tools after a crash, with a focus on the assessment of the battery and high-voltage system condition, ensuring that the HV battery is in a safe and stable condition (avoidance or early detection of thermal runaway after a collision), and maximising the likelihood of keeping the battery in service in the vehicle once fixed / re-using it, in line with the proposed regulation on circularity requirements, eco-design and end-of-life of vehicles. Both on-board monitoring systems and off-board systems can be considered;\n- If making use of connectivity to on-board monitoring systems, the accessibility to the health and safety information / data needs to be addressed. This includes the development of state of safety and state of health algorithms to provide the remaining useful life and potential safety risks of the battery after a collision, complementing the information on the digital battery passport [1] ;\n- Extrication procedures protecting both crash victims and emergency service workers to the best possible extent, also considering the gender dimension. To ensure the effectiveness of fire handling, suppression, and rescue procedures for crashed BEVs, it is crucial to further develop these practices in close collaboration with first responders;\n- Fire extinguishing techniques and firefighting procedures for BEVs (if the case also including innovative fire extinguishing media), considering the risks specific for EV including potential toxic products of the associated chemical reactions, as well as vehicle designs supporting firefighting. Particular attention should be paid to the design of the battery pack and its integration into the vehicle, including auxiliaries;\n- Develop and implement procedures and tools for the safe handover, handling, transport and storage of crashed BEVs, with wide dissemination to relevant stakeholders towards standardised procedures;\n- Quantify the rate and severity of BEV fire safety impacts by conducting a comparative study addressing aspects such as frequency of BEV fire and severity of outcome, and provide statistical analysis to deliver science-based communication on the safety of Light Duty BEVs to the general public;\n- Real-life demonstration (in comparison to the state-of-art) of Light Duty (vehicle category M1 and N1) BEV condition assessment tools, data analysis, as well as firefighting, rescue, and handling procedures on a series production vehicle;\nThe project should actively seek interaction with and make use of results from workshops on EV fire safety currently being organised under the IEA HEV Technology Collaboration Programme, and where relevant with the Sustainable Transport Forum Task Force 6: “Developments for fire safe deployment of recharging points in covered parking garages” [2] .\nThe project should take account Open Science, its practices and learning, and the project’s results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data [3] .\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

      "scope": "Currently, the value of a vehicle is mostly defined by driven mileage and age, underestimating the actual residual value. However, the real actual residual value of a BEV and its component should help implement Circular Economies (CE) strategies beyond classical shredding, such as reuse, remanufacturing, recovery of precious material. The residual value is determined by ageing and degradation in the use phase, repair and maintenance measures, operation of the vehicle and also by a CE-specific design. Consequently, prospective/prescriptive maintenance strategies, repairability and upgradability of vehicles must be addressed in relation to actual ageing and degradation of a component as part of upcoming CE strategies (including 9R approaches) to ensure longer (in terms of higher residual values) and more sustainable lifetimes of road BEV without over-sizing components and/or increasing the use of raw materials.\nThis topic focuses on the road BEV electric drive components relevant from a system integration point of view where high combined operational loads are to be expected, on the thermal management systems as well as on power electronics. The ageing and degradation of pack and module level is included whereas the battery cell level is excluded.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- Analyse holistically the ageing and degradation of relevant, critical BEV functions and relevant sub-systems (excluding battery cells), that determine the Vehicle Lifetime and residual value under the aspect of functionality, safety and economic considerations (e.g., through correlating real-life operational loads with observed degradation and ageing effects);\n- Develop tools and methods to assess, measure and predict ageing and degradation of relevant sub-systems (e.g. modelling combining multi-physical models describing ageing/degradations and vehicle operation and applying AI approaches, non-invasive evaluation to describe ageing and degradation over lifetime, multi-physical testing to accelerated occurrence of realistic ageing and degradation phenomena, use of novel sensors for measuring ageing and degradation in an electric drivetrain, etc.);\n- Develop extended lifetime concepts and assess lifetime extension measures for BEV ensuring high residual values including right-sized design, operation, maintenance, refurbish and repair, by e.g. definition of prospective maintenance strategies, implementing ageing / degradation models into the design, advanced control strategies to minimise operational loads contributing to ageing and degradation phenomena including sensor technologies to obtain real-life operational data;\n- For all relevant, critical components, follow the “digital product passport” approach, to achieve maximum traceability [2] ;\n- Data management for operational loads, maintenance, and repair measures;\n- Validation and demonstration of concepts and designs for higher residual values (less aging and degradation under operational conditions) appropriate to the TRL level via a full physical demonstrator of all components of the electric drive-in representative laboratory environment.\nThe project(s) should take account Open Science, its practices and learning, and the project’s results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data [3] .\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

Nonetheless, the current market application of these vehicles is largely confined to transport tasks with restricted range and considerable repetition. To expand their use, diverse strategies and applications must be explored and validated for scalability based on real data coming from logistics operators. The development of new application models should showcase the potential flexibility of HD-BEVs and assist end-users in establishing innovative usage frameworks and models.\nSeveral actions are already underway for HD-BEV logistics (including the projects funded under the 2Zero topics HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-08 and HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-01-04) with a focus on extending range and charging capacity but also identifying challenges, gaps and impacts of HD-BEV usage in logistics operation. There is an urgent need to address these challenges and gaps for a smooth transition into daily operations and considering the wide variety of use cases and missions to be addressed.\nFinding the optimal balance between the vehicle’s configuration and available charging infrastructure for different logistics use cases is key to address the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) challenge in the short and long term.

These models should include use cases across the EU and Associated Countries focused on long-haul transport missions and be based on existing, real operations data;\n- Test and validate in real demonstrations new logistic operational concepts and models allowing a scalable deployment of HD-BEV in long haul transport missions optimising the different variabilities of a shipment (range, charging time, various European regions, drivers required break/rest times etc.).\n- Develop and test associated digital tools for effective, robust integration in the overall logistics operations and fleets, and facilitating interoperable cross-border services. These associated digital tools – where relevant also developed as digital twins – are to enable and support efficient optimisation of the concepts, models, solutions and operations;\n- Real-life demonstrations should be based on existing fleets of operators (e.g. haulers, shippers, freight forwarders) with different categories of vehicles and missions. Demonstration should at least include 8 different types of long-haul missions in different climatic conditions, including cross-border missions, and involve several logistic companies and/or logistic users;\n- Develop scenarios for optimum balance of vehicles’ performance and configuration, charging strategies and solutions. The scenarios will include information on the distance dependency as a function of vehicle combinations, location and capacity of charging stations and payload demands;\n- The demonstrated concepts, models and tools should allow strategies for firm upscaling of HD-BEV implementation, taking into account the logistics operational models, the performance of complete vehicle combinations also considering the effects of on-board batteries on the ageing and energy recuperation;\nThe project(s) should take account Open Science, its practices and learning, and the project’s results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data [1] .\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

EU wind-tunnels is a prime example of such strategic capabilities towards climate-neutral aviation. The Horizon 2020 RINGO project has provided an analysis of needs, gaps and overlaps of European Aviation R&I Infrastructures, especially strategic infrastructures, in order to achieve Flightpath 2050 goals, while a recent internal effort has updated, refined and prioritised those findings.\nThe scope of this topic is focused on better understanding and further advancing critical technologies that require the update of relevant strategic EU testing capabilities, in particular wind tunnels. While new instrumentation and development of new testing procedures and digital tools is within the scope of this topic, other Research and Technology Infrastructure investments (i.e., buildings, auxiliary facilities, etc) fall outside of the scope.\nThe complexity of multi-disciplinary design and optimisation of future aircrafts requires extensive computational efforts, validated by wind-tunnel and propulsion testing. The scope of this topic is confined by strategic priorities and proposed aircraft concepts as defined in the updated Horizon Europe Clean Aviation Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. Emphasis is placed on airframe and propulsion transformative technologies, including the integration of advanced propulsion architectures on the airframe, distributed hybrid/electric propulsion, high aspect ratio and highly flexible unfuelled wing (e.g. for LH2 aircraft), boundary layer ingestion, ground effects in new aircraft architectures and aeroacoustics.\nThe projects should be aligned with the Fly the Green Deal vision and 2050 climate neutral aviation objectives and if possible, exploit synergies with other EU and National projects. In those cases that the participation of multiple testing facilities is required, the projects should also define and agree upon interfaces, common architectures and common data exchange formats.",

To that aim, maritime operators are working to replace the currently used engines with alternative power conversion systems that will allow the use of low and zero-carbon fuels for propulsion. Among all ship-types, the decarbonisation of long-distance shipping will rely the most on successful innovative solutions with high power outputs. Apart from greenhouse gas emissions, other pollutants and harmful ship emissions (e.g., NOx, SOx, PM, etc.) coming from the fuel mix currently used in waterborne transport and from low and zero-carbon fuels need to be lowered and eliminated where possible. This topic aims to integrate and further develop various fuel cells (FC) and internal combustion engines (ICEs) solutions for waterborne transport running on low and zero-carbon fuels and scaling-up their technological maturity on-board. Actions addressing these challenges should also align with the European Economic Security Strategy.\nProposals should address one of the two following areas:\nArea A: Projects demonstrating FC solutions should deliver results that will reach a combined power output of at least 5 megawatts (MW) with energy supply provided by low and zero-carbon fuels;\nArea B: ICEs solutions should demonstrate a combined power output of at least 10 MW with at least 85% of the energy supply provided by low and zero-carbon fuels.\nThe two selected projects will be complementary, not demonstrating the same areas describe above. If in one of the areas no proposal meets the minimum thresholds, then only one project will be funded under this topic.\nRegarding GHG emission reduction, proposals should follow the provisions of FuelEU Maritime and the IMO GHG reduction strategy on fuel standards.\nProposals should address all the following aspects, noting that appropriate consideration should be given to selecting a suitable design approach:\n- One full scale demonstrator of a vessel above 5 000 GT, showing the potential of integrated systems for 100% energy load provision under normal operations;\n- The demonstrated solutions identify their impact on air pollution, showing at least: i) 90% reduction of NOx from IMO tier III; ii) sulphur emissions below 90% and; iii) a maximum of 5 mg/kWh of PM;\n- Consider fuel flexibility and address cost impacts of energy efficiency, taking into account impacts on vessel CAPEX and OPEX plus the opportunity cost of increased power conversion and fuel storage size and mass;\n- An innovative storage and handling solution on-board of ships and mixing of sustainable alternative fuels with sustainable or low carbon pilot fuels.

The scope should include not just storage tanks, engines, or injection mechanisms but also virtual prototyping and hardware-in-the-loop testing for verification, especially for the (safety) automation systems. Impact on factors like load-steps, load acceptance, and vibrations should also be included, as to facilitate the design of high-performing, maintainable, and safe vessels must be taken into consideration;\n- Development of relevant on-board after-treatment of specific pollutants sourced from low and zero-emission fuels (e.g., ammonia slip or N2O for ammonia or formaldehyde for methanol);\n- Proposals must justify how their objectives, results, intellectual property (IP) management and exploitation strategy contribute to the creation of EU added value and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain.

      "scope": "In the quest to get energy reductions from retrofitting, new design requirements and constraints are emerging, e.g., due to the introduction of new low-carbon fuels, and new added propulsion systems (e.g., wind assisted systems). Furthermore, other technical measures are not yet “standardised” for retrofitting existing ships, due to other difficulties or high costs.\nThere is also a lack of design/retrofitting experience in applying these new solutions. A practical example is the space rearrangement in the electrification of the ship, including the installation of heavy battery sets, a solution that uses space: but changing ship’s volume and weight distribution along the beam might have a strong effect on the dynamic stability of the vessel.\nThe realisation of ad-hoc web tools and guidelines to help with the retrofit task is currently under development, based on the limited number of new small-scale demonstrators within ongoing projects (e.g., Green Marine, RETROFIT55, etc.).\nThese approaches combine mature and new technologies creating a decision-support system (DSS) that integrates these solutions. However, even if the final results have not been delivered yet, these projects are considering the retrofit problem in a silo-based mode, that is not including a full multidisciplinary design optimisation with the mutual interactions among the technologies. This might lead to difficulties in achieving overall optimal goals, therefore resulting in a limited impact on the transition to zero-emission waterborne. These simplified strategies are indeed not accounting, in a full coupled mode, for the interferences and mutual influences among the different retrofit systems installed on board (i.e. available space and payload, safety constraints, electrical constraints, etc.): in other terms, they are not considering the global problem of retrofitting in a holistic way, which is a major objective of this call. Also, the holistic intelligent tools could explore possibilities for modular or serial solutions which reduce costs of retrofitting.\nFurthermore, in the short and medium term we are and will be observing multiple ongoing regulatory processes (by IMO, EU, UNFCCC, ES-TRIN) developing frameworks and standards that will shape waterborne transport in the next decades. This further element of variability, i.e. the uncertainty in decarbonisation ambitions as well as on the variability in cost and availability of carbon-neutral fuels, not considered yet in the current approaches, claim for a large effort for new holistic retrofit intelligent design tools for exploring multidisciplinary solutions in variable decarbonisation scenarios.\nInnovative holistic intelligent design tools, with a multi-objective strategy and AI simulators, have to be developed rapidly and tested if we want to significantly contribute to the transition to zero-emission waterborne transport, and this has to be done by integrating the many sectors involved in the design.\nProposals are expected to address all the following aspects:\n- The development of a novel intelligent design digital tool which can fully integrate decarbonising concepts (e.g., alternative fuel propulsion systems, auxiliary propulsion systems, renewable energy sources, etc.) and can be used for retrofit concepts;\n- The design digital tool should have the capability of considering together multiple decarbonisation solutions for operating vessels, accounting for reciprocal influences, and be able to integrate existing loading instrument (software or data package) for stability, weight and hull strength control;\n- Retrofit configurations might include changes in operational modes (e.g., slow steaming, weather routing, etc.) which should also be evaluated against human and organisational risk factors introduced;\n- The design tool should also include a life-cycle perspective from design to scrapping;\n- Preliminary (intermediate) validation of the design tool by testing at model scale original versus refitted ship solution, also assessing the environmental impact of the solutions, including on biodiversity, air quality and aerial and underwater noise;\n- Final demonstration, applying the tool in six virtual demonstrations, one for each one of the six ship types detailed in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport Partnership, considering together multiple decarbonisation solutions and producing final optimised refitted designs to be tested in operational environment conditions with a given operational profile. Participation of ship owners and operators to these virtual demonstrations should be ensured to pave the way to further market deployment of the solution and real retrofitting operations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.",

      "scope": "OPS solutions currently available in the market, while conforming to standards, have gaps in terms of flexibility and modularity, in particular regarding the expected future demand in terminals with a high turnover of diverse waterborne traffic served. OPS port infrastructure solutions so far are static or have limited flexibility at the berth, whereby several static connections are needed to cover port requirements. As an alternative or supplement, further research is needed in OPS solutions that allow OPS to be provided within and across different terminals and port areas. Solutions developed under this topic should be generally applicable, so they can be used for several types of vessels. However, the solutions should consider the special features of the different ship types and services, such as the safety requirements for tanker and chemicals traffic where connectivity in complex environments is an issue.\nFollowing Fit-for-55 OPS requirements in AFIR and FuelEU Maritime, new Onshore Power Supply products are being developed, including High-Voltage OPS systems, within a framework of robust standardisation. However, further research is needed on the mature, flexible and safe provision of OPS at anchorage and in a flexible way along different terminals and port areas through technologies other than barges, applicable to a wide range of ports with different geographies and conditions.\nThe development of solutions to simultaneously provide OPS, fast battery charging as well as loading operations needs further standardisation and dedicated protocols. Standardisation of fast battery charging is underway; therefore, proposals are encouraged to explore relevant research for fast battery charging beyond the current or soon to be adopted standards (e.g., IEC/EEE 80005-4) to be implemented in the developed solutions for OPS at anchorage or mobile and flexible OPS.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\n- Demonstrate innovative scalable OPS solutions as described in the expected outcomes, addressing either Area A or Area B.\n- Minimise the risk of system failure and ensuring continuous operation, resilient to adverse climate conditions;\n- Identify remaining gaps in standardisation for the solutions developed and define recommendations for standards, protocols and/or solutions at least for safe fast battery charging. Projects addressing Area B should also address these activities for load/unload cargo operations simultaneously;\n- Research into systems that can simultaneously provide fast battery charging and OPS;\n- Development of earthing protection solutions through monitoring of the grounding resistance to predict failure;\n- All solutions should align with the optimisation of onboard High Voltage transformers, automation of onboard connection systems, optimisation of onboard OPS switchboard operation, and onboard safety monitoring systems and blackout prevention/mitigation systems to synchronise process and the communication between ship and shore;\n- Adequate training and support for crew and port staff are crucial for the successful implementation and operation of the solutions developed training programs should encompass system operations, maintenance procedures, safety protocols, and emergency response protocols to ensure safe and efficient operations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT).

      "scope": "WAP systems (e.g., rotor sails, rigid wing sails, soft wing sails, ventilated foil system, etc.) have gained significant attention as means of reducing ship fuel consumption, and GHG and other emissions, while they are also considered as primary means of propulsion for future newbuilt cases. Several ongoing EU-funded projects are already working on WAP systems with focus on holistic optimised ship design, control, and operation, including changes in conventional propeller propulsion, and focused on Deep Sea Shipping (DSS). However, there is still a variety of barriers and challenges that need to be addressed; the main challenges are to provide certainty on emission saving performance, define standards, while also facilitating WAP retrofitting. The aim of the topic is to develop a methodology that will allow to quantify and monitor the real impact of WAP systems into ship propulsion.\nProposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Demonstration of at least one full scale WAP solution and its management and monitoring on-board. This demonstration will be used to also validate the methodology for integration of the energy provided by the WAP devices to the ship propulsion;\n- Develop a holistic framework for the design optimisation for wind-assisted propulsion, either as a means of enhanced energy efficiency, or primary propulsion solution; the framework should work as design tool to facilitate the industry uptake of WAP technologies by introducing tailor-made solutions for various ship types, based on their operational profiles and navigation routes;\n- Use of systems for advanced monitoring of energy consumption, performance optimisation, energy savings, mitigation of GHG and other polluting emissions. The project should make optimal use of state-of-the-art sensor and digital technologies with a view to achieve continuous monitoring of energy made available from WAP devices; methodology should cover various types of WAP and should be applicable for all types of ships and operations;\n- Assessment of environmental and wider benefits, including reduced emissions of air and water pollutants, underwater noise, biodiversity as well as cost-effectiveness for either standalone WAP solutions or combinations with other low and zero-emission technologies and/or energy efficiency measures;\n- Focus on safety and operational aspects, for addressing any technical and operational challenges that may arise from the introduction of WAP systems – and possible combinations with other energy efficiency solutions – for ships and ports, including other land infrastructure;\n- Addressing scalability and adaptability issues to the existing fleet, such as efforts to promote the standardisation of the different solutions, and application of the solution considering the real environmental conditions and the impact of climate change in wind patterns;\n- Examine a variety of business cases and propose a number of market measures to address the lack of market confidence in WAP solutions and the uptake of such systems in the maritime industry.\nProposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base..

      "scope": "The European Commission is currently involved in several initiatives that aim to accelerate the deployment of solutions relevant for the market uptake of renewable and low carbon fuels. Firstly, following the initiative from the Commission, the EU has adopted FuelEU Maritime Regulation, which sets the binding reduction targets for GHG intensity of energy used on board for maritime vessels. As a flanking measure to this regulation, the Commission has promoted the Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Alliance, which encompasses a large portion of all fuel producers, with the goal to facilitate the investment in renewable and low carbon fuels for waterborne and aviation, aiming to clarify feedstock availability, demand, and supply forecast, and to promote a commercial pipeline of projects.\nThe Revised ETS directive has put shipping under the umbrella of ETS with corresponding revenues to be allocated to green shipping projects. Consequently, the Commission is preparing the first dedicated calls under the Hydrogen Bank, focusing on maritime applications.\nIn the context of international collaboration, the Commission is currently working, together with the Joint Research Centre, on a study about the Global Gateway Green Shipping Corridors (GGGSC). This report aims to identify ports outside of the EU of strategic interest to the bloc that can be part of such corridors and to aggregate them into corridors that meet a combination of policy priorities. In this context, the Commission will also look into possible actions to support partner countries to ensure the availability of renewable and low carbon fuels within the selected ports.\nIn addition, the Commission has published a number of studies, including on the “Development of outlook for the necessary means to build industrial capacity for drop-in advanced biofuels” [1] and has published a call for a second tender for a study on “How to mobilize industrial capacity building for advanced biofuels” [2] . The EIB published the study “Financing sustainable liquid fuel projects in Europe: Identifying barriers and overcoming them” in May 2024. In addition Horizon Europe includes a call \" HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-13: Support to the activities of the SET Plan Key Action area Renewable fuels and bioenergy ”, with deadline in February 2025. Advanced biofuels are also an option for renewable energy supply in waterborne transport. Furthermore, under topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01-07: Support for the deployment of R&I results for climate mitigation, five coordination and support actions have been selected. Synergies should be drawn in relation with the Innovation Fund program.\nProjects are expected to take the previous initiatives as a starting point and go beyond their conclusions. In particular, they must address all of the following aspects:\n- Provide project development support to at least 20 proposals [3] within the renewable and low carbon fuel ecosystem for waterborne transport in order to increase the number of applications in programmes such as Horizon Europe and its successor, Innovation Fund, CEF AFIF and schemes such as EIB Loans, structural funds, as well as initiatives at national and regional level and at international level within the Global Gateway strategy. The proposal should consider coordination of their activities with already existing EU project assistance providers such as the EIB Advisory project development assistance scheme, avoiding duplication. Proposals will propose KPIs in relation with additional projects and activities to be performed thanks to its action. The support to projects should be provided following a competitive selection process, prioritizing projects admitted to the RLCF Alliance Project Pipeline and/or Global Gateway. The proposal shall elaborate on project selection methodology.\n- Creation of an analytical financial tool which allows users to model a project and understand the economic rational of a business case and identify those assumptions, drivers and barriers which are critical to ensuring that the underlying projects are financially and economically viable. The projects for which the analytical tool will be developed are those which produce renewable and low carbon fuels necessary for the sustainable goals of the waterborne transport sector, as defined in the Green Deal, especially by ensuring a wide European geographical coverage in the EU. These models must take into account the results delivered through the Roundtable 4 of the RLCF Alliance in their financial analysis. The models will aim to preserve the industrial competitiveness of the EU industry, in alignment with RED, FuelEU maritime and ETS, also considering any potential unlevelled playing field risks/challenges vis-a-vis other countries outside the European Union. These models will examine the scalability potential of the fuel considering production, transport and distribution, security of supply in ports in and outside Europe, GHG emission saving on Well to Wake basis, distance continuously sailed on the fuel, size of ship in terms of installed power, total distance sailed and transparency on the project costs. Additionally, these models will also aim to leverage potential synergies between RFNBOs and advanced biofuels technologies development should be identified and utilized for the benefit of both pathways. Appropriate linkage to the RLCF Alliance is encouraged.\n- In collaboration with the RLCF Alliance, develop and conduct a series of workshops/trainings with financial institutions and relevant waterborne stakeholders to facilitate the market uptake of waterborne and renewable and low carbon fuel production solutions for waterborne transport, with a particular attention to the access to capital for demonstration projects with a higher technological risk profile and dissemination of best practices to access financing and funding. The project will need to carry out relevant dissemination activities to communicate the results of the project to all relevant policy makers as well as stakeholders from the industry and civil society.\n[1] Development of outlook for the necessary means to build industrial capacity for drop-in advanced biofuels - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] Call for tenders CINEA/2024/OP/0005 STUDY ON HOW TO MOBILIZE INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ADVANCED BIOFUELS\n[3] Individual proposals will not be considered public deliverables to ensure full confidentiality",

Establishment of key conditions for job quality, safety, up-to-date competences and acceptance of working conditions in diverse cultural contexts;\n- Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social groups involved in or potentially affected by the R&I development, considering gender and other social categories, and thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake, and building trust in results and outcomes;\n- Policy and governance recommendations in view of establishing new or updating existing legislation to cover remote operations, e.g., through clear descriptions of stakeholder roles and responsibilities that may vary for different types of remote operations.",
      "scope": "This topic aims at exploring the operational and societal conditions and prerequisites for complementing the ODD of CCAM solutions through remote operations, as defined by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) [2] . Here “remote operations” is to be understood as the remote monitoring, assisting, and operating the Automated Driving System (ADS) by a person located externally. The vehicle operates with a high degree of automation (SAE Level 4), but a human operator can monitor its actions and surroundings remotely and intervene, if needed. Intervention ranges from providing strategic guidance and tactical commands to determining vehicle manoeuvres and taking over control in scenarios that include, but are not limited to, emergency responses, system malfunctions, ADS system limits, or complex navigational challenges unforeseen by the CCAM system.\nThe topic invites proposals to explore two use cases that should focus on remote operations on urban and rural public roads and/ or confined areas, dealing with at least two of the following areas:\n- Transport of people: use cases that enhance public transport services (i.e., by fleets of remotely operated shared vehicles, including, if relevant, on-demand responsive transport) improving accessibility and mobility for users in all their diversity in terms of all characteristics (e.g., age, gender, disability, etc);\n- Transport of goods: use cases that optimise logistics (e.g., remotely operated delivery vehicles in urban environment), improving efficiency and sustainability;\n- Combination of people and goods transport: use cases of integrated solutions (e.g., remotely operated vehicles that transport goods during off-peak hours and convert into passenger transport services during peak times), improving vehicle utilisation, while addressing congestion and reducing environmental impact.\nFor each of these use-cases, operational and societal aspects that would enable remote operations of multiple ADSs must be evaluated in terms of business models, infrastructure needs, safety assurance, legislation, as well as organisational aspects that may include cultural elements. Additionally , operator’s skills, performance and situational awareness of the remote operator must be addressed. The analysis of potential rebound effects and questions related to energy sufficiency and sustainability should not be neglected. Where applicable, the use of generative AI should be considered.\nThis topic aims to understand all the different components of the complex ‘system-of-systems’, combining technological advancements with a focus on human-centred design/ interfaces, as well as societal needs, considering their implications from the start. This will enable to lay the foundation for the development of advanced demonstrator use cases, integrating the various components in next phases, although technological adaptations of existing approaches to reach an integrated system-of-systems should already be validated in the relevant environment here.\nTechnological components of the system-of-system are foreseen to include e.g. infrastructure support, communications, cyber-security, key enabling technologies (possibly including generative AI, etc.). Proper selection of existing technology enablers and related SW developments to implement the remote operation functions is essential. Societal aspects must be identified (e.g., user-centric design, working conditions), through the inclusive engagement of stakeholders for problem formulation and concepts development, co-creation and co-assessment of deployment and operations.\nStakeholders could include user groups and public advocacy organisations, mobility companies, technology providers, public agencies, planners, community groups, industry associations, first responders, social partners [3] and workforce representatives. These should be involved in building awareness, trust, and support for remote operations, identifying skill gaps and skill transferability of operators as well as training needs. Additionally, various stakeholders should be engaged to examine unanticipated implications (e.g., environmental, social equity etc.) and to co-develop solutions, as well as other pre-conditions making remote operations feasible (e.g., policy, governance, territorial planning, infrastructural readiness, integration into Traffic Management Systems (TMS), organisational and legislative requirements etc.).\nThe dimensions of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) – reflection, inclusion, anticipation, and responsiveness – should guide the exploration of the technological components of the system-of-system to achieve societal readiness, involving relevant Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines (e.g., psychology, geography, Science and Technology Studies, sociology, ethics).\nThe safety assurance of remote operations entails the development of a corresponding validation methodology, as the remote operator with the wireless communication system and the related interfaces becomes part of the system to be validated. Proposed actions shall develop the basic principles of such a methodology considering the framework provided by EU 2022/1426, building upon, to the extent possible, the results of the SUNRISE [4] project and seeking close coordination with actions under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 [5] , HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02 [6] as well as HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-03 [7] .\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM [8] .\n[1] See SNS calls for further linkage.\n[2] https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/Informal%20document%20No16e_0.pdf\n[3] As per the legal basis of Art. 154 of the TFEU.\n[4] Safety assurance framework for connected and automated mobility system , grant agreement ID: 101069573 .\n[5] Generation of scenarios for development, training, virtual testing, and validation of CCAM systems.\n[6] Scenario-based safety assurance of CCAM and related HMI in a dynamically evolving transport system.\n[7] Orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic within the CCAM ecosystem.\n[8] See the evaluation methodology here .",

      "scope": "In recent years, the work in vehicle automation has concentrated on technological advancements, human factors, extensive testing, and demonstrations to raise public awareness and facilitate market readiness. Even with the progress achieved, the challenges related to technical functionality as well as use, demand and affordability remain considerable.\nTo tackle these challenges, a sensible approach is needed to implement vehicle automation developments in real-life applications via large-scale demonstrations such as Field Operational Tests (FOTs) within Living Labs. Additionally, particular use cases for public road transport and logistics should be targeted. The validation of technical enablers (also considering technological readiness), understanding user behaviour, promoting acceptance and advancing societal readiness for both mobility of people and transport of goods remains a major focus. The tests and large-scale demonstrations should be conducted in both mixed traffic conditions and confined areas, where applicable. Ensuring interoperability of connected automated systems across various vehicle brands, regions, and Member States is essential.\nSince successful large-scale demonstration activities require strong and early engagement from key stakeholders, comprehensive planning and preparatory actions, leveraging previous and ongoing efforts, are needed to ensure European competitiveness and leadership.\nThe action should leverage previous and ongoing projects at European and national levels on demonstration activities. It should consider the outcomes of the European software-defined vehicle of the future initiative. The frameworks and guidelines formulated by the CCAM Partnership shall be duly reflected [1] . This is to optimise the return on investments and create a strong basis for future large-scale demonstration projects to boost an industry-wide European deployment strategy for CCAM.\nProposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Define the prerequisites for performing large-scale demonstration projects, considering vehicle technology maturity and other technical enablers, physical and digital infrastructures, as well as approval frameworks for public road testing;\n- Prepare and refine methodologies, test procedures and tools for the execution of field tests and efficient data management;\n- Identify test and demonstration sites across Europe for CCAM functions, considering the extension of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), using vehicular communication technologies (V2X) that enables Traffic Management Systems (TMS) for improved traffic flow and operational efficiency;\n- Initiate a cross-sector stakeholder forum for the definition of use case relevant projects in different domains and their implementation.\nThe proposed action is expected to foster the collaboration between public and private stakeholders to achieve common objectives and assess societal impacts. Engagement of key stakeholders, covering the whole CCAM ecosystem, such as mobility and transport users, , public transport, shared mobility and logistics operators, infrastructure providers, traffic managers, public authorities, and research institutions must be ensured. In addition, European industrial players such as OEMs and suppliers should be adequately represented.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot :\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.

Therefore, the concept of individually “adaptive” systems has to be followed and elaborated in all its particular aspects, as the consideration of “average” human behaviour is not sufficient.\nThis has large implications on the design of HTI systems.\nSuch systems should provide a reliable and seamless interface between the driver and the vehicle in normal driving conditions as well as in specific situations with a risk of generating high cognitive load, diverted attention, inattention, impaired driving, or in the case of instantaneous limitations in driving capabilities.\nAs drivers and their experience, as well as driving conditions, may vary a lot, HTI systems will need to address a wide variety of use cases in order to ensure a relevant Operational Design Domain (ODD) [1] . Therefore, in-cabin monitoring systems with adequate accuracy are key to have a clear understanding of the driver state, while considering all contextual in/out cabin data, so that the vehicle can propose a pertinent and tailored strategy to prompt the required driver action or behaviour.\nAdvances in in-cabin monitoring and multi-modal sensing technologies, as well as robust detection/prediction of driver cognitive status adapted to the situation awareness, are necessary to achieve these objectives. The same applies to the need to link interior with exterior sensing capabilities.\nIn addition, it is necessary to enhance drivers’ understanding of the assisted and automated driving system and to avoid mode confusion. In this aspect, the implications of automation on driver training and driver's licence requirements should be investigated. However, training methods for experienced drivers should also address the evolving technologies. This could include innovative training methods that prepare drivers for various mode transitions and safety critical scenarios like the development of virtual and mixed reality training approaches. The automation status and the limits of the system should be clearly communicated via the HTI to prevent mode confusion, enhance trust, and avoid unnecessary deactivation of the assistance or automation systems.\nSpecial attention should be dedicated to the “hand-over” and “take-over” phases. Hand-over/take-over requests should be done considering the context (e.g. information from other vehicles or infrastructure) and the state of the driver in a way to minimise cognitive stress related to hand-over and take-over. In this context, it is important to investigate standardised requirements for the human-machine interface (including in case of system failure), including their assessment.\nIn this respect, the proposals should focus on developing strategies to prevent driver disengagement and minimise cognitive load during critical situations. Additionally, behavioural models and methodologies should be created to identify activities or behaviours that the vehicle's human-machine interface (HMI) should avoid or block (such as entertainment systems that may distract the driver from driving tasks). These strategies should be scalable based on the sophistication of the vehicle's sensing capabilities.\nMoreover, proposals should address use cases involving specific populations, such as elderly drivers with decreased sensing abilities and higher sensitivity to cognitive load, young and inexperienced drivers, and professional drivers performing multiple tasks simultaneously. For these groups, a key question is how to meet their unique needs and how to balance tailored (or personalised) vs. standardised approaches for the best results. When considering these groups, proposals are expected to consider the gender dimension.\nAlso, trust is mandatory for the acceptability of these systems: precision, reliability, and transparency need to be ensured. In particular, the vehicle response to a given situation as well as the level of information to be conveyed needs to be coherent and logical. Relevant research areas to achieve this objective will be the definition of multi-modal and multi-sensorial vehicle warning and response strategies for the safe management of critical phases considering user responsiveness and the severity of scenarios.\nHTI systems should be upgradable both in software and in hardware with minimal disruption for the users, while ensuring that the intended effect and functionality is improved or at least maintained. A cross-fertilisation opportunity would be to investigate how other transport modes (e.g. aviation) handle upgrades/updates with minimal disruption for the user.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant social sciences and humanities (SSH) expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.\nFurther research and data collection is needed to ensure a better understanding of synergies between driver and assistance systems, to evaluate their performances in different contexts and user scenarios. This will enable appropriate adaptive and “self-learning” strategies to be tailored to the individual driver abilities and preferences.\nIn consideration of the above, proposals should address all the aforementioned aspects and issues in order to achieve the expected outcomes.\nResearch needs should be addressed in coherence and continuation with topics HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-10, DT-ART-03-2019, HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-02 [2] , as well as HORIZON 2020-MG-2018-TwoStages (MG-2-1-2018).\n[1] Results from the project of topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 could be relevant for this issue.\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2021-d6-01-10\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2022-d6-01-02",

      "scope": "The effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures depends, among other factors, on the magnitude and rate of warming, which can lead to context-specific hard limits being encountered. However, the scientific evidence related to adaptation effectiveness remains limited, and providing a universal definition of what constitutes effective adaptation is challenging. This is motivated by difficulties in defining baseline conditions given the dynamic nature of the adaptation, in measuring avoided impacts and in establishing causality. Other problems arise from the long lead time until responses show outcomes, and limited understanding of trade-offs across spatial scales, community systems and sectors, which limits the application of a system approach, essential for this analysis. Ex-ante and ex-post monitoring and evaluation of adaptation at different timelines and scales is also critical but currently scarcely implemented. It is urgent to better understand and assess adaptation effectiveness and limits to increase adaptive capacity, resilience against extreme, and slow onset, non-extreme events, and to reduce vulnerability and exposure.\nThe actions should generate assessments of the effectiveness and limits of adaptation options based on quantitative and qualitative evidence (privileging scientific literature but systematically integrating insights from grey literature and including diverse group’s perspectives and knowledge), methodologically sound (replicable and with new metrics and indicators informed with uncertainty) and comprehensive in the criteria considered (such as economic, technological, legal, institutional, socio-cultural, geophysical, environmental and cross-cutting aspects that determine soft limits). Cross-cutting criteria to be included are the contribution of the adaptation solutions to mitigation, their ability to reduce cascading, compound effects and risks transmission, the degree of use of nature-based solutions (NBS), together with the feasibility, the ambition level, and their contribution to equity and justice. Other relevant aspects that should be considered are the exogenous factors, the gender, age and intersectional dimensions, the governance and the barriers and enablers.\nActions should evaluate adaptation effectiveness and limits as a function of time and for a comprehensive range of warming rates, considering the changing variability patterns. Projects should address all of the following aspects:\n- Further the understanding of the general and context specific (e.g., regional, sectoral, etc.) drivers of adaptation effectiveness and limits, including vulnerability;\n- Develop a robust methodology to assess the effectiveness and limits of adaptation options in a consistent way, assuring comparability among assessments. Such a methodology should: Synthesise different sources of observational (both quantitative and qualitative evidence) and modelling data that are relevant at the regional, local or sectoral levels to assess multiple dimensions of effectiveness and adaptation limits over time; Have sufficient common core elements to ensure consistency and comparability among regions and sectors, and sufficient flexibility to reflect their contextual specificities; Include a comprehensive set of measurements and indicators and approaches to characterise adaptation as a process and assess quantitatively and qualitatively the multiple dimensions and aspects of adaptation effectiveness and limits (both hard and soft); Explore the optimal balance between standardisation and the context specific elements of the methodology.\n- Test and apply the methodology for the following purposes: To evaluate the effectiveness of advanced and short-term planned adaptation strategies, for a variety of European (EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries) environmental and socio-economic sectors, conditions or regions (a minimum of 6 study cases is recommended).

As a result, this core part should be also a joint deliverable for not later than month 24. Then, the methodology should be separately extended by individual projects to address EU regional and sectoral contexts (e.g., by specific modules) maintaining consistency with the core part.

      "expected_outcome": "The action is intended to set the foundation for future collaborative activities between the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) on climate change research in the context of the implementation of the Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy (CCSE) [1] under the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on Science, Technology, and Innovation [2] and its Innovation Agenda [3] .\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Stakeholders, including funding entities, contribute more effectively to the implementation of the climate action pillar of the AU-EU CCSE Research and Innovation Partnership through an agreed strategy and reinforced R&I coordination;\n- The R&I agendas and initiatives on climate issues relevant for Africa are better aligned and defragmented between the EU, national and multilateral levels. The impact of funding is enhanced;\n- The climate-related data gap on Africa is reduced and AU countries are better able to access, utilise, and deploy state-of-art climate knowledge and services to inform decision-making and to accelerate a science-based implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development;\n- Impacts and risks of climate change are more accurately assessed, adaptation strategies are developed, and early warning systems are deployed. This strengthens climate and disaster resilience in the AU member states, contributing to the international dimension of the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Disaster Resilience Goals, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Nairobi Declaration and the Early Warnings for All initiative;\n- The climate research community in the AU is strengthened, with researchers and scientific institutes enabled to engage more effectively in international fora and multilateral collaboration networks, with positive effects on diversity and quality of climate science and benefiting key international assessments and processes (e.g., IPCC, IPBES).",
      "scope": "African societies and productive sectors are already experiencing widespread impacts from both natural hazards and human induced climate change. These include loss of lives and biodiversity, increased disease burden, water shortages, ocean acidification, reduced food production, and diminished labour efficiency and economic growth. The IPCC warns that with additional warming, the risks will further escalate, making a strong case for prioritising climate risk reduction and adaptation efforts while transitioning to low-carbon future. Socioeconomic, political, and other environmental factors - such as high demographic pressure, violent conflicts, biodiversity loss and pollution, unsustainable land and ocean use, strong reliance on agriculture and natural resources - interact with climate change to amplify the region’s vulnerability. These compounded challenges undermine Africa’s socio-economic advancements, hindering its efforts towards sustainable development. Yet, the continent is very poorly equipped to deal with these challenges: only 40% of its population has access to early warning systems [4] – the lowest rate of any region of the world, and many countries lack quality climate knowledge and data.\nIn addition, despite multiple efforts to promote climate research and capacity development, African scientists, scholars, and practitioners are still significantly underrepresented in international fora, such as the IPCC. Furthermore, the bulk of research concerning the region is performed by groups from developed and emerging countries, not sufficiently incorporating indigenous knowledge, local contexts and needs. It is now vital that the assessments of climate change, and its related impacts, risks and response strategies are increasingly delivered by the African community.\nThis action is intended as a preparatory step towards future joint collaborative activities between the EU and the AU, and their respective Member States to support the implementation of the “Climate Action for adaptation and mitigation” Pillar of the CCSE partnership. This pillar encompasses 1) climate-related data, 2) climate services, 3) and an integrated knowledge approach to support AU countries in their efforts to implement the Paris Agreement. These priorities should be used to frame the activities of the project. The action should establish a joint strategy for improving the availability and accelerating the uptake of advanced climate knowledge, data, and products across Africa. The aim is to enhance climate literacy, to develop and increase uptake of climate services and early-warning systems, and to support capacity building while taking into consideration the continent’s socio-economic circumstances and user needs. It is expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Develop a joint roadmap identifying priorities, flagship actions and feasible implementation architecture (including most appropriate financing instruments, not limited to EU level) to pave the way towards more targeted EU-AU cooperation on climate change research, with particular focus on climate risk reduction and resilience building (to be delivered within the first year of the project);\n- Mobilise and secure commitments from European and African national funding entities and other actors (e.g., philanthropies, international cooperation entities and financial institutions) necessary to implement joint EU-AU collaborative activities, including a potential Horizon Europe co-fund action in 2026-2027 work programme (ideally within the first year of the project);\n- Map the relevant EU funded projects (such as CONFER, FOCUS-Africa, DOWN2EARTH, ALBATROSS, SAFE4ALL, HABITABLE, TEMBO-Africa, SINCERE [5] ), match their outputs with the objectives of the CCSE Partnership, and cluster them to establish a vibrant community. Develop and implement a strategy to consolidate, curate, valorise and disseminate the projects’ outputs towards African and European stakeholders to amplify their impact. This should include a user-friendly approach (ideally integrated into and complementing existing mechanisms/repositories) for sharing best practises and lessons learnt from past and ongoing EU-funded projects, and with links to internationally and nationally funded activities, to provide visibility and enable scaling and replication of successful initiatives. In addition, the action should also investigate how Europe could best learn from Africa and how to valorise, disseminate knowledge and implement solutions from the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, other relevant EU Missions and other initiatives (like the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean region, PRIMA) that are of relevance to the African context;\n- Design and start implementing training and capacity building strategy that should enable: i) effective climate action planning and management, ii) enhanced representation and diversity of African science and scientists in international fora, iii) upscaled generation of policy relevant knowledge, data, products and services, on climate change, and iv) a greater participation of women, youth, indigenous and marginalised communities.\nThe action should bring together core European and African funding agencies (and define a credible pathway for mobilising additional funders), research organisations and other key African entities such as regional and national climate service centres. Strong representation of African partners in the consortium is a core requirement (see eligibility conditions). In addition, the action should strive at better connecting scientists, policy makers, practitioners, and local communities for integrated solutions, at mobilising private sector engagement and at promoting the uptake of indigenous knowledge and Citizen Science. Efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is managed according to the FAIR principles [6] .\nThe action should build on and aim at improving the coordination between existing and forthcoming multilateral and bilateral initiatives, such as the Climate Services for Risk Reduction in Africa (CS4RRA) [7] , the ClimSA [8] programme, as well as projects funded by the EU (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and the JPI-Climate (ERA4CS). Synergies should also be sought, where possible, with relevant activities of the World Climate Research Programme, the World Adaptation Science Programme, the World Meteorological Organisation, the Group on Earth Observations, or the Copernicus programme. It is advisable that the action integrates the lessons learnt from the implementation of the energy pillar of the CCSE Partnership [9] .\n[1] ﷟https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-climate-change-and-sustainable-energy-ccse_en\n[2] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation_en\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/ec_rtd_au-eu-innovation-agenda-final-version.pdf\n[4] https://www.undrr.org/news/early-warnings-all-africa\n[5] Please refer to https://cordis.europa.eu/projects/en for more information\n[6] FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).\n[7] http://cs4rra.wascal.org/\n[8] https://www.climsa.org/\n[9] See https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/815264 and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/963530",

      "scope": "Given the rapidly developing climate crisis, there is an increasing need for accurate, reliable, and actionable information at global to local spatial scales, and near to long timescales. This information supports a range of requirements, including policy related ones. In particular, simulations and knowledge delivered that feed into the IPCC, including the Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) and later ones, should be internally coherent and well-coordinated. The modelling, setting, ensemble, and simulation design should be suited to meet societal and policy demands to support timelier European and international climate policy developments. This also implies progressing towards an operational framework to provide the best possible information for societal decision-making that brings together available approaches. The resulting simulations and analysis should sample the full spectrum of climate risks. In particular, as global mitigation efforts are presently insufficient and temperatures continue to rise, the impacts of global warming overshoot on the Earth system and the feasibility, possible pace, and implications of bringing global temperatures down in a sustainable way after an overshoot need to be explored. This analysis should also consider the risks and consequences of potential abrupt and irreversible impacts (e.g., sea level rise, changes in ocean circulation, ocean-acidification, water cycle alterations, soil alterations, aridification, species extinctions, loss of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets, and crossing climate and ecological tipping points).\nTherefore, actions should address all of the following aspects:\n- Generate future global climate projections with state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESM) which are built on the latest improvements in modelling technologies and in process understanding with a more complete representation of climate–carbon cycle feedback;\n- Design climate simulations considering the socio-economic scenarios from the most up to date set of Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). Greenhouse gas emission pathways should be provided based on various societal mitigation and adaptation choices and land-use scenarios. Climate feedback should be also considered. The resulting assessment should link allowable carbon emissions with key climate targets, spanning policy relevant temporal and spatial scales;\n- Deliver scenarios and simulations with different levels and durations of warming overshoot (to be selected for their policy relevance), assessing the corresponding risks accounting for fast and slow onset processes and the feasibility and limits of carbon dioxide removal methodologies;\n- Update and coordinate the assumptions as well as the observational and simulated climate data sets underpinning the models and experiments of the various climate science communities (including Earth system, sectoral impacts, adaptation, and mitigation modellers) across international programmes, such as IAMC, CMIP, CORDEX and ISIMIP, optimising the interaction between them as much as possible within the same IPCC cycle;\n- Design a framework to coordinate and incorporate the suite of global and regional climate projections, encompassing the range of available model resolutions and model realism, using consistent concentration and emission-driven ESMs, enhancing collaboration between European Earth system modelling and service provision, such as Copernicus and Destination Earth. This system should include cross-analysis and evaluation of the full suite of models, including approaches for sampling projection and scenario uncertainty (e.g., emulators). The framework should also make the modelling results more accessible and understandable to the practitioners and decision makers;\n- Improve the existing infrastructure landscape (software, tools, data, adaptation of models to High-Performance Computing (HPC)), to support the delivery of global and regional climate projections and associated analysis (for which a part of the budget may be allocated, but not more than 30% of the total eligible costs). This should be complementary to efforts funded through the European Research Infrastructures, Euro-HPC Joint Undertaking, Digital Europe Programme and other sources. ESM simulations are intended as the core of the topic with links to other modelling activities. To maximise the policy relevance of the climate simulations delivered, the operationalisation framework and the scenarios should be developed in co-creation with policy makers (e.g., through advisory boards or other participatory procedures).\nWhen dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, protocols, code, and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles [1] .\nThey should envisage clustering activities with any other relevant projects (in [2] and outside of Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation and exchange of results. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes. As this endeavour should be supported by the research communities that continuously improve the modelling systems and related infrastructure, strong interaction and coordination is expected with the projects funded under previous calls of this Destination and other relevant projects on ESM, with the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-02 “Advancing Earth System Models to increase understanding of Earth system change”, and with the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-SERV-02 (area on Research infrastructure services to improve the understanding and prediction of future climate changes and its impacts).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with the Global South [3] , to promote capacity and consensus building, for example, by training early career researchers from Global South countries (see specific conditions for financial support to third parties). Maximum total amount dedicated to these activities should not exceed EUR 1.000.000.\n[1] FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).\n[2] For example, relevant projects funded under the Horizon Europe calls Climate sciences and responses.\n[3] In absence of a single formal definition of the Global South, the list of low - to middle- income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding should be used for this purpose – see the Horizon Europe List of Participating Countries on EU Funding and Tenders Portal for up-to-date information",

      "scope": "ESMs are the primary tools used for assessing future changes in the climate system. They have increased in their resolution and realism over the past two decades. Despite these advances, there remain several poorly understood and simulated processes, interactions and feedbacks that limit their ability to deliver accurate predictions and projections of global and regional Earth system change, and to aid understanding and quantifying future climate variability. Specially challenging is how variability interacts with extreme events (including compound ones), in particular related to precipitation and water availability (both excess and scarcity).\nActions should address all of the following aspects:\n- Improving the simulation of the coupled Earth system and its sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic forcings, with a better representation of key Earth system and climate feedbacks and processes, including, among others, one or more of the following advances [1] : The interplay between global change, regional climate variability, and changes in climate and weather extremes; Terrestrial-ocean-climate interactions; Coupled climate-carbon-water cycle feedbacks; Coupled climate-ocean-ice interactions; Aerosol-cloud-climate forcing and feedback; Climate-vegetation-fire interactions; Climate-air quality interactions; Interactions between land use scenarios (in terms of changes in the land use and surface, such as those related to carbon dioxide removal, with consequences on the water and carbon cycles, albedo and aerosols) and regional climate.\n- Increased collaboration across different model development approaches encompassing the range of available model resolutions and model realism.\n- Bring together and further improve existing and new observational and reanalysis datasets, models, emulators, and analysis tools to facilitate rapid and in-depth bias identification, model calibration and validation, and evaluation and understanding of model simulations.\nActions should exploit the opportunities offered by state of art digital technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics or Artificial Intelligence (AI). They should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, extending to aspects such as assumptions, protocols, code, and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles [2] .

      "scope": "F-gases are the fastest growing group of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The Montreal Protocol resulted in decreasing use and emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances and will now also regulate a phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), representing the largest share of F-gas use, of which the majority is used in refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment.\nThe project should improve the knowledge base of F-gas use and emission pathways under baseline conditions (i.e., policies as they are today), pathways that meet the Kigali Agreement and pathways that outperform the Kigali Agreement. The development of these pathways should also include fluorinated greenhouse gases not regulated under the Montreal Protocol, in particular those covered by the Regulation (EU) 2024/573 on fluorinated greenhouse gases [3] . It should cover all main regions globally separating at least the countries that fall under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol and those that do not, and preferably further disaggregating them within these two classes, taking into account for instance climate conditions. The development should assess the interaction with the energy system, notably related to the deployment of HFC-alternatives in refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment and its impact on energy efficiency, the deployment of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) or its alternatives in electrical switch-gear. Possible impacts on emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) should be considered. The pathways should give detailed insights into the technologies available, including the use of F-gases-free alternatives.\nMost F-gas emissions are related to the use in the refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump (RACHP) equipment. This sector is projected to be one of the highest contributors to future global energy demand increases. The action should include the development of modelling tools that allow for the representation at national level of the use of F-gases and their alternatives at least in this RACHP sector, with a view to develop tools that would allow parties to the Montreal Protocol to assess at national level different options of mitigating HFC use, and the interaction with the decarbonisation of the energy system. The action should thus expand and improve the number of tools that can provide such detailed information at country level, including for the so called Article 5 Parties under the Montreal Protocol, in a manner that would improve the knowledge base for parties to implement specifically the Kigali Agreement to the Montreal Protocol as well as allow them to get insights in how to create synergies with the climate mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement, including the decarbonisation of the energy system.\nAll research outputs should be managed according to the FAIR principles [4] . Beyond open access to scientific publications and research data, open access to software, models, algorithms, workflows and protocols, cell lines, compounds, etc. is required.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and participate in networking, intercomparison and joint activities to exploit synergies and maximise complementarities. Activities on energy efficiency of equipment, on electricity grids or the safe use of chemicals would be of specific interest in this context. Projects should also envisage clustering activities with any other relevant projects (in and outside of Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation and exchange of results.

      "scope": "Anthropogenic climate change influences the intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events – the latest IPCC report warns that anthropogenic climate is already affecting weather and climate extremes across the globe and with every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes will continue to become larger.\nAttribution science tries to answer the question of what the role of anthropogenic climate change relative to other drivers (natural and non-climate anthropogenic factors), is for a given extreme climate or weather event. It is relatively nascent, and while it is fast advancing, numerous gaps remain, including on compound and cascading events, the interplay between slow and fast onset events, the appropriate statistical methods and the proper consideration of various degrees of vulnerabilities and exposure.\nSome tail events, risks and associated impacts are inherently poorly represented in current simulation records. The latest advances in numerical modelling, AI and Machine Learning, counter-factual datasets using large ensembles and digital twins, for example, could increase the sample size of simulated rare – including compound and cascading - events and offer opportunities to explore the decision-making and estimated impact space (e.g., in relation to water, air pollution, ecosystem status, land use – and their combination). Propagating uncertainties along the causality chain is an important aspect to address in this context.\nActions should address all of the following aspects:\n- Advance attribution science through a combination of observations, models, attribution methodologies applied to the physical climate conditions (fast and slow-onset event attribution for a more accurate estimation of how the likelihood and intensity of the hazards have been altered by anthropogenic climate change) and impacts (identifying how the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and local implemented responses affects residual impacts);\n- Advance the understanding of the interplay between natural variability and anthropogenic climate change both in the recent past (since the instrumental data is available) and in the near- and mid- term future (2025-2060), as well as the interplay between climate and non-climate drivers of impacts, and socially differentiated vulnerability patterns;\n- Advance methodologies to collect diverse in-situ and remote sensing observations to develop or contribute to robust extreme event and impact databases;\n- In the context of attribution, focus on extreme and slow-onset events and their interactions (including cascading and compound events) and impacts (on human systems and ecosystems), locally implemented responses and their limits (response capacities), with due consideration of vulnerable regions;\n- Deliver enhanced methods to separate the effects of climate trends (including in extreme events) from trends in exposure and vulnerability, both in observed datasets and in model scenarios;\n- Investigate how different model enhancements (e.g., finer resolution, increased complexity) impact the realism and accuracy of the modelled climate and weather extremes. Strive to investigate inter-model differences and their implications for extreme event attribution and contribute to multi-model and intercomparison approaches (e.g., Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, ISIMIP), including with downscaling and bias correction of global models for better simulation of extreme events;\n- Building on latest advances in attribution studies, improve forecasting of extreme climate- and weather-related events and their impacts, and contribute to the evolution of climate services;\n- Improve the knowledge of how to operationalise the attribution science and forecasting for informing future planning including in some of the areas relevant for advancing disaster preparedness and prevention capacity building, humanitarian aid operations, and adaptation plans (e.g., early warning systems, disaster risk reduction including with nature-based solutions, emergency relief) via co-design and co-production with operational actors, including citizens and civil society globally and with due consideration of associated challenges in the Global South;\n- The results should serve as a basis to ensure policies and actions that follow from the attribution studies can integrate climate justice.\nWhen dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, protocols, code, and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles [1] .\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and participate in networking and joint activities together, as appropriate. Collaboration with Destination Earth is encouraged. Clustering activities with other relevant ongoing projects (in and out of Horizon Europe) should be envisaged for cross-projects cooperation and results from relevant past and ongoing projects, including XAIDA [2] and CLINT [3] , should be considered.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Citizen Science and other innovative and participatory forms of research could be appropriate for this action.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with the Global South [4] in the context of scientific capacity building, disaster risk reduction and strengthening of climate resilience.\n[1] FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).\n[2] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003469\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003876\n[4] In absence of a single formal definition of the Global South, the list of low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding should be used for this purpose – see the Horizon Europe List of Participating Countries on EU Funding and Tenders Portal for up-to-date information",

      "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Climate policies are made more inclusive and equitable, facilitating acceptance across political and societal stakeholders with various socio-economic and development status, both within the EU and globally, enabling high ambition climate action and helping to deliver on the European Green Deal’s commitment to “leave no one behind”;\n- There is an improved consensus between the Global North and the Global South within the UNFCCC process, unlocking a greater momentum in the implementation of the Paris Agreement;\n- The evidence base underpinning IPCC assessments is strengthened, diversified, and made more inclusive, facilitating consensus and government approval processes;\n- Social science perspectives on justice and equity are better incorporated into policy narratives, scenarios, and models, improving their societal relevance and ensuring that climate action strategies are more reflective of the needs, values and concerns of diverse societal groups, building trust in results and outcomes, and increasing their uptake potential.",
      "scope": "Climate change and the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient future raises complex justice questions around equitable sharing of benefits and burdens of mitigation and adaptation efforts. These considerations not only animate global climate negotiations, but also increasingly emerge as a central issue for national politics, legal systems and for the society at large. Fairness thus becomes both a critical enabler and a potential barrier for shaping ambitious climate action, underscoring the need for prioritising research on advancing just climate transitions within the EU and globally.\nFor example, mitigation scenarios that have informed and influenced global climate policymaking and target-setting, and form a vital component of IPCC assessments, have been criticised for not considering fairness more explicitly and systematically, creating a barrier to their acceptance as a basis for global mitigation efforts. On the other hand, to avoid exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and locking into maladaptive pathways, it is also necessary to better account for the justice dimension in adaptation planning and implementation.\nActions should advance more comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of climate justice in the context of the European and global mitigation and adaptation policies, promoting awareness, consistency and co-production approaches. They should take into consideration socio-economic, territorial and development disparities that exist between and within countries, regions and across various segments of the population. Actions should address multiple dimensions of justice, diverse spatial and temporal scales (e.g., intergenerational justice), and explore the role of a broad range of social, political, economic, and cultural contexts and factors. These include both collective (such as values, power structures, institutional and legal frameworks, political economy, development models, climate elites) and individual (such as age, gender, and intersectionality) features. Building on the resulting insights, actions are expected to develop recommendations on how to design, implement and evaluate just climate transitions, including definition of specific indicators, standards, and criteria to better operationalise the justice concept in adaptation and mitigation pathways. Among others, actions should address some of the following aspects [1] :\n- Improve integrated assessment models to better represent justice and equity, differences in regional outcomes, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities;\n- Enhance clarity, comparability, and transparency across global mitigation scenarios with regard to different justice aspects. Evaluate the feasibility and consistency of regionally differentiated long-term mitigation goals in terms of, for example, investments and financial flows, governance and institutional needs;\n- Analyse distributional aspects of climate policies, assess consequences for well-being and living standards of people from different socio-economic and development contexts. Advance research to assess the needs of and the effects on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged population segments (e.g., elderly, children, women, migrants, minorities, households at risk from energy and/or transport poverty) and sectors, and provide recommendations for corrective measures;\n- Assess the trade-offs and co-benefits between climate action and inequality reduction. Explore the role of inequality and injustice as constraints to individual and collective climate action;\n- Investigate innovative climate policy instruments, initiatives and approaches alternative to those prioritising economic efficiency and propose a broader spectrum of climate policies with more attention to equity. Assess their feasibility;\n- Investigate justice in the context of sectorial transitions, with focus on under-researched (from justice perspective) sectors such as agriculture, forestry and land use;\n- Advance research on how to better account for the needs and constraints of communities representing diversity of vulnerability profiles in disaster risk reduction and adaptation strategies.\nActions should address justice and equity of climate policies both within the EU and from a global perspective, but they may choose to prioritise one of these dimensions, using the other as framing information.\nThe research should be conducted through close collaboration between research teams from Europe and low or middle-income countries, hence international cooperation is required (see eligibility conditions). Moreover, involvement of key stakeholders and regional experts as part of an inclusive process is essential to guarantee that all relevant perspectives are adequately represented. The involvement of civil society is also highly recommended.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and participate in networking, intercomparison and joint activities, to exploit synergies and maximise complementarities. They should also envisage clustering activities with other relevant projects (in [2] and outside of Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation and exchange of results. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\n- Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\n- This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities. Consortia should mobilise a variety of SSH research backgrounds, in particular equity, poverty, and gender experts.\n[1] The evaluation will follow the standard Horizon Europe evaluation criteria, regardless of the number of the aspects covered.\n[2] For example, relevant projects funded under the calls of Horizon Europe Cluster 5 on Climate sciences and responses and Cluster 2 on Innovative research on social and economic transformations.",

      "expected_outcome": "The action is intended to set the foundation for future collaborative activities between the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) on climate change research in the context of the implementation of the Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy (CCSE) [1] under the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on Science, Technology, and Innovation [2] and its Innovation Agenda [3] .\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Stakeholders, including funding entities, contribute more effectively to the implementation of the climate action pillar of the AU-EU CCSE Research and Innovation Partnership through an agreed strategy and reinforced R&I coordination;\n- The R&I agendas and initiatives on climate issues relevant for Africa are better aligned and defragmented between the EU, national and multilateral levels. The impact of funding is enhanced;\n- The climate-related data gap on Africa is reduced and AU countries are better able to access, utilise, and deploy state-of-art climate knowledge and services to inform decision-making and to accelerate a science-based implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development;\n- Impacts and risks of climate change are more accurately assessed, adaptation strategies are developed, and early warning systems are deployed. This strengthens climate and disaster resilience in the AU member states, contributing to the international dimension of the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Disaster Resilience Goals, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Nairobi Declaration and the Early Warnings for All initiative;\n- The climate research community in the AU is strengthened, with researchers and scientific institutes enabled to engage more effectively in international fora and multilateral collaboration networks, with positive effects on diversity and quality of climate science and benefiting key international assessments and processes (e.g., IPCC, IPBES).",
      "scope": "African societies and productive sectors are already experiencing widespread impacts from both natural hazards and human induced climate change. These include loss of lives and biodiversity, increased disease burden, water shortages, ocean acidification, reduced food production, and diminished labour efficiency and economic growth. The IPCC warns that with additional warming, the risks will further escalate, making a strong case for prioritising climate risk reduction and adaptation efforts while transitioning to low-carbon future. Socioeconomic, political, and other environmental factors - such as high demographic pressure, violent conflicts, biodiversity loss and pollution, unsustainable land and ocean use, strong reliance on agriculture and natural resources - interact with climate change to amplify the region’s vulnerability. These compounded challenges undermine Africa’s socio-economic advancements, hindering its efforts towards sustainable development. Yet, the continent is very poorly equipped to deal with these challenges: only 40% of its population has access to early warning systems [4] – the lowest rate of any region of the world, and many countries lack quality climate knowledge and data.\nIn addition, despite multiple efforts to promote climate research and capacity development, African scientists, scholars, and practitioners are still significantly underrepresented in international fora, such as the IPCC. Furthermore, the bulk of research concerning the region is performed by groups from developed and emerging countries, not sufficiently incorporating indigenous knowledge, local contexts and needs. It is now vital that the assessments of climate change, and its related impacts, risks and response strategies are increasingly delivered by the African community.\nThis action is intended as a preparatory step towards future joint collaborative activities between the EU and the AU, and their respective Member States to support the implementation of the “Climate Action for adaptation and mitigation” Pillar of the CCSE partnership. This pillar encompasses 1) climate-related data, 2) climate services, 3) and an integrated knowledge approach to support AU countries in their efforts to implement the Paris Agreement. These priorities should be used to frame the activities of the project. The action should establish a joint strategy for improving the availability and accelerating the uptake of advanced climate knowledge, data, and products across Africa. The aim is to enhance climate literacy, to develop and increase uptake of climate services and early-warning systems, and to support capacity building while taking into consideration the continent’s socio-economic circumstances and user needs. It is expected to address all of the following aspects:\n- Develop a joint roadmap identifying priorities, flagship actions and feasible implementation architecture (including most appropriate financing instruments, not limited to EU level) to pave the way towards more targeted EU-AU cooperation on climate change research, with particular focus on climate risk reduction and resilience building (to be delivered within the first year of the project);\n- Mobilise and secure commitments from European and African national funding entities and other actors (e.g., philanthropies, international cooperation entities and financial institutions) necessary to implement joint EU-AU collaborative activities, including a potential Horizon Europe co-fund action in 2026-2027 work programme (ideally within the first year of the project);\n- Map the relevant EU funded projects (such as CONFER, FOCUS-Africa, DOWN2EARTH, ALBATROSS, SAFE4ALL, HABITABLE, TEMBO-Africa, SINCERE [5] ), match their outputs with the objectives of the CCSE Partnership, and cluster them to establish a vibrant community. Develop and implement a strategy to consolidate, curate, valorise and disseminate the projects’ outputs towards African and European stakeholders to amplify their impact. This should include a user-friendly approach (ideally integrated into and complementing existing mechanisms/repositories) for sharing best practises and lessons learnt from past and ongoing EU-funded projects, and with links to internationally and nationally funded activities, to provide visibility and enable scaling and replication of successful initiatives. In addition, the action should also investigate how Europe could best learn from Africa and how to valorise, disseminate knowledge and implement solutions from the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, other relevant EU Missions and other initiatives (like the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean region, PRIMA) that are of relevance to the African context;\n- Design and start implementing training and capacity building strategy that should enable: i) effective climate action planning and management, ii) enhanced representation and diversity of African science and scientists in international fora, iii) upscaled generation of policy relevant knowledge, data, products and services, on climate change, and iv) a greater participation of women, youth, indigenous and marginalised communities.\nThe action should bring together core European and African funding agencies (and define a credible pathway for mobilising additional funders), research organisations and other key African entities such as regional and national climate service centres. Strong representation of African partners in the consortium is a core requirement (see eligibility conditions). In addition, the action should strive at better connecting scientists, policy makers, practitioners, and local communities for integrated solutions, at mobilising private sector engagement and at promoting the uptake of indigenous knowledge and Citizen Science. Efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is managed according to the FAIR principles [6] .\nThe action should build on and aim at improving the coordination between existing and forthcoming multilateral and bilateral initiatives, such as the Climate Services for Risk Reduction in Africa (CS4RRA) [7] , the ClimSA [8] programme, as well as projects funded by the EU (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and the JPI-Climate (ERA4CS). Synergies should also be sought, where possible, with relevant activities of the World Climate Research Programme, the World Adaptation Science Programme, the World Meteorological Organisation, the Group on Earth Observations, or the Copernicus programme. It is advisable that the action integrates the lessons learnt from the implementation of the energy pillar of the CCSE Partnership [9] .\n[1] ﷟https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-climate-change-and-sustainable-energy-ccse_en\n[2] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation_en\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/ec_rtd_au-eu-innovation-agenda-final-version.pdf\n[4] https://www.undrr.org/news/early-warnings-all-africa\n[5] Please refer to https://cordis.europa.eu/projects/en for more information\n[6] FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).\n[7] http://cs4rra.wascal.org/\n[8] https://www.climsa.org/\n[9] See https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/815264 and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/963530",

Actions will contribute to the achievement of the European Green Deal targets, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commitments, the Urban Agenda for the EU, the New EU Urban Mobility Framework, the Habitat III New Urban Agenda and the Paris Agreement. European cities need to engage urgently in sustainability and climate-neutrality transitions.\nThe partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- Enhanced multi-level cooperation and alignment on R&I on sustainable urban development across and within cities, regions, and countries, including international outreach and cooperation with other networks and initiatives;\n- EU is strengthened as a role model for R&I on sustainable urban development; cooperate with international cities and research funding networks (e.g., Belmont Forum) to align strategies and R&I agendas and strengthen the role of DUT as co-lead of the Urban Transitions Mission (UTM) under Mission Innovation (MI). In this context, potential synergies could be also considered with ongoing EU funded work related to Africa, to enhance the implementation of DUT Strategic Research &Innovation Agenda (SRIA);\n- Set up innovative, cross-sectoral, and inclusive urban governance, policy, and decision-making harnessing the full potential of social science and citizens’ engagement in the city development process;\n- Integrate emerging mobility and transport services, and align them with the citizens’ needs and preferences;\n- Foster sustainable, climate-neutral, safe, resilient, socially inclusive, liveable, and attractive neighbourhoods, towns, cities and urban services, with reduced environmental footprint (e.g., burdens from other pollutants, foster the reuse of materials in view of increased integration of circularity aspects) and net-zero greenhouse emissions, and enhance well-being and quality of life for citizens;\n- Empower local authorities, municipalities, businesses, social partners, civil society, knowledge institutions and citizens with necessary capacity, knowledge and skills; deliver efficient urban tools, solutions methodologies and processes to actively engage in sustainability and climate-neutrality transitions;\n- Increase science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal, the Urban Agenda for the EU and other European, national, regional, and local urban-relevant policies and strategies (e.g., Circular Economy Action Plan).",
      "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European “Driving Urban Transitions to a sustainable future ” (DUT) Co-funded Partnership identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 – first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16: Co-Funded Partnership: Driving Urban Transitions (DUT) – and to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in line with its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nThe proposal should capitalise upon new collaboration opportunities offered by the Association Agreements to Horizon Europe, the “EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” Mission and the Global Urban Transitions Mission (UTM) of Mission Innovation to enhance expertise, capacities, critical mass and broaden geographical coverage and outreach capacity. With respect to international outreach, mutual benefits from collaboration and cooperation with global and international cities and research funding networks should be pursued to align strategies and research agendas and promote scientific evidence and good practice for urban policy at international level.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16 and HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01-08, it foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should describe plans, activities and initiatives that would enable the DUT to ensure, as appropriate, a seamless pursuance of its strategy, objectives and actions to fill important gaps in knowledge, evidence, innovation, technology, data, capacity and skills, integrated approaches, while fostering inclusive and participatory governance structures and assisting cities at European (and, as appropriate, global) level in designing and implementing the transition towards sustainability and climate neutrality.\nThe proposal should describe in detail additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the grant and justify their added value as compared to ongoing actions, whilst accounting for actual progresses in relevant EU and international policy frameworks and urban initiatives. The proposal is expected to cover DUT calls for proposals included in the work programme (2025-2027). from 2025 to 2027.\nThe proposal should elaborate on modalities to scale-up synergies with the works of the NetZeroCities Mission Platform, the CapaCITIES coordination and support action and, as appropriate, with other EU Missions and related platforms (e.g., MIP4Adapt). Those synergies will underpin the implementation of the “EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” Mission and ensure the coherence and complementarity of activities while leveraging knowledge and investment possibilities.\nFurthermore, concrete actions should be envisaged to enhance collaboration and synergies with other European Partnerships such as Clean Energy Transitions (CET), Built environment and construction (Built4People), Rescuing biodiversity (Biodiversa+), Safe and Sustainable Food Systems, Towards Zero Emission Road Transport (2ZERO), Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM), EIT Urban Mobility and Water4All.\nInterfaces with public procurement and investment programmes and links with Urban Innovative Actions (UIA) under the Urban Agenda for the EU, the European Urban Initiative (EUI) under the Cohesion Policy Funds, private funds, etc. should be explored to support take-up and larger scale implementation of tested approaches and solutions.\nThe consortium that won the grant under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. It is noted that this consortium submitted the initial proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024. Moreover, it has implemented the partnership through the co-funded calls in the years 2022 and 2023. In this context, the current consortium has specific expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities implemented in 2022 and 2023 co-funded calls, or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, no other consortium would be able to continue the activities of the Partnership underway without a significant disruption of the ongoing activities.\nWhile the grant under this topic should be attributed to a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16, the consortium applying to the present topic may include additional partners and new activities, to be funded by the grant subject to an evaluation, which will take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation (as relevant), and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.",

      "scope": "Unrestricted access to state-of-art space equipment and related technologies is a pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially for some families of equipment, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high-performance space requirements and alternative products, sourced from outside EU, are either affected by non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability, that limit the access, re-export or raise challenges in terms of trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security dimension.\nWithin the frame of this topic it is expected to finance and implement development projects aiming at maturing critical space equipment with the final goal of lowering the dependency from outside EU, establish a long-term sustainable supply chain and support EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current EU capabilities that cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority.\nBelow, the list of space equipment and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been identified based on needs related to strategic institutional programs, inputs from relevant European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies.\n- Chip Scale Atomic Clocks [Target final TRL 6]\n- Solar Cells [Target final TRL 5-6]\nAdditional, context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding & Tenders Portal outlining all relevant information for each of the above-mentioned development lines.\nA proposal should address only one technology area and clearly identify the area being addressed.\nSpace is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to relevant national and/or other activities at European level. Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should report how the complementarity is ensured.\nTo achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants must include a dedicated proposal’s paragraph covering:\n- The description of the technology and high-level breakdown of the space equipment supply chain to be used. Applicants should demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation (EAR).\n- The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.\nProposal covering space equipment and related technology developments that are targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable standards (e.g. ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC, …) that are considered relevant for implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification.\nThe proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the objective of:\n- Analysing and describing, in detail, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU;\n- Describe the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including time to market indication, of the developed product.\n- Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply chain established for the EU-COM project.\n- Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU solutions and competition from outside EU.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement is signed, beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.\nIt is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. Under this light, for example the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not relevant.",

The envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence.\nThis pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept which is unique compared to other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on previous R&I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG) [1] .\nThis topic addresses the finalisation of the detailed design of the servicing component of the ISOS pilot mission , that should feature robotic capabilities. The servicing component will be based on previous and ongoing R&I developments and could provide services such as inspection, upgrade, repair, life extension including refuelling, delivery and exchange of payload, reconfiguration, relocation, capture and removal of assets in space.\nProject results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:\n- A sustainable, highly automated and digitalised, flexible and economically viable space infrastructure, building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, e.g. plug-and-play spacecraft functionality introducing recycling/re-use of spacecraft modules/functionalities;\n- ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the servicing component and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and operational concepts;\n- Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with the other mission components (i.e. HOST, logistics and satAPPs) and the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA) [2] ;\n- Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex 163 ;\n- Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental and/or commercial needs;\n- Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases.\nThis topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.",

Digitalisation is a major enabler for enhancing the value of an End-to-End EO and SatCom system.

      "scope": "The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include:\n- Improve the ability of Copernicus’ and other models to assimilate new and other satellite observations (e.g. the Copernicus Sentinel Expansion and Next Generation missions, contributing missions, meteorological satellites, research satellites) that are sensitive to surface parameters and fluxes. It is also necessary to undertake research on information content of early satellite data and unlock their exploitation in reanalyses at global and regional scales;\n- Exploit innovative methods (including AI/ML) for data rescue for in situ and remote sensing observations, in particular regarding past and changing observing methods and environmental factors, and on error analysis, quality control and bias adjustment of the historical observation record. The aim is to make best possible use of early observations from various records of in situ and remote sensing observations to improve physically consistent analyses of the atmosphere, the ocean, the land and the cryosphere towards centennial timescales;\n- Improve the use of Sentinel and other data in all Copernicus reanalyses and their use across different services. Beyond processing and reprocessing activities, specific coordinated developments in terms of observation operators and observational error characterization will be required;\n- Explore innovative methods (e.g. AI/ML) to accelerate the production and updates of reanalyses, to capture reanalyses uncertainties efficiently, and to reduce overall computing energy/carbon footprint.\nThe C3S reanalyses represent a significant portion of the service data requests and are at the heart of the service product line and further exploitation (e.g. initialising climate predictions, evaluation of climate historical projections, climate intelligence, development of climate applications, AI/ML weather forecasts). The preparation of the future C3S coupled Earth system reanalyses is underway to significantly improve the consistency across earth system components and lengthen the timespan. An extension of the reanalyses back to the early 1900’ would meet many requirements of users but such a task would be impossible without an adequate investment in data rescue and in the reprocessing of EO data. Reanalyses play a key and vital role in climate monitoring and in the attribution of extreme events, but the development of the required counterfactual dataset is often ad-hoc and lacks operational implementation.\nBringing together European expertise on a wide variety of observations, climate data records and global and regional reanalyses will be paramount, and this will require a very tight collaboration with space agencies, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). International cooperation is hence strongly encouraged in this topic. This will fully realise the progressive exploitation of Copernicus Sentinel and other data for the monitoring of a changing climate over Europe and worldwide. In addition, the proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream applications that would benefit from these improvements. Synergies with Destination Earth are also encouraged.\nAdditionally, the transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities should be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

Pollen and many atmospheric trace components such as VOCs represent major public health issues, affecting hundreds of millions of people globally and in Europe. Elaborated soil-vegetation-atmosphere surface/interface models and associated parameterization are needed to represent emissions, concentrations and deposition of such constituents.

      "scope": "The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include:\n- Better understand and characterise the impact of wildfires on the carbon cycle and on anthropogenic emissions through land use change. This has been recognized especially in the climate community when developing process-based vegetation models for use in climate models. While a large variety of empirical or process-based vegetation models exist today, it is still unclear which type of model or degree of complexity is required to model fire adequately at regional to global scales. International collaborations, such as the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), have evaluated existing global fire models against benchmark data sets for present-day and historical conditions;\n- Investigate the current state of fire modelling and specifically how the interaction between droughts, fires and vegetation can be accounted for in a global monitoring system, such as the CO2MVS. Because of the monitoring aspects of the CO2MVS, use should be made, where possible, of including observation-based data sets representing certain aspects of the fire-vegetation interaction;\n- Investigate how a better understanding of the impact of fires on vegetation can improve the estimates of fire emissions of chemical species and aerosols, and subsequently air quality products in CAMS and the fire risk forecasting in CEMS.\nWildfires have become widespread during summer over many regions of the world, including Europe, and have major safety and larger societal impacts (air quality and health, aviation, weather, agriculture, etc). Wildfires and biomass burning are significant sources of CO2 and air pollutants in the atmosphere. Fires also change the vegetation and therefore affect the exchange of CO2 between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Current vegetation and fire models need to be improved to refine the quality of CAMS products (air quality, emissions), the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) supporting CEMS and forcing data sets for climate projections supporting the IPCC. Innovative methodologies should be investigated to include fire-vegetation interactions, also taking into account the impact of drought conditions in global monitoring systems such as the CO2MVS capacity, via the improvement of currently used process-based vegetation models or through empirical models. The use of relevant observation-based data sets (e.g. vegetation states, drought conditions, burnt areas) should be a key element of these methodologies. Current CLMS products should be considered, including options for potential improved specifications. The proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream applications that would benefit from these improvements.\nThe transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with, and/or coordination across the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.\nThe possible participation of the JRC may consist in (1) ensuring access to relevant models, tools and datasets of the operational CEMS, (2) providing a good understanding of existing operational workflows for CEMS and advice regarding the operational feasibility of new developments and (3) testing of new developments/prototypes for CEMS in a pre-operational setting.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

      "scope": "The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include:\n- Coupled data assimilation (e.g. between ocean and biogeochemistry, ocean and sea-ice, ocean and waves and atmosphere) to control in a more consistent way the ocean state variables across ocean components or forcings and to get more benefits from observations;\n- Development of multi-scale methods capable of assimilating high-resolution and high-frequency observations as well as of constraining larger scales;\n- Development of methods to produce reliable estimation of analysis and forecast uncertainties;\n- Use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in data assimilation schemes (e.g. use of emulators for ensemble generation, model error estimation, bias correction, separation of scale and model parameter estimation);\n- Use of new types of observations (e.g. new Sentinel Expansion and Next Generation missions, new in-situ observations) or higher-resolution of existing data streams;\n- Development of methods and tools to systematically assess the observing system impact in data assimilation systems (e.g. analysis and forecast sensitivity to observation);\n- The development of software infrastructure that can accommodate different assimilation methods (including artificial intelligence techniques), and facilitate the sharing of algorithms and optimization of computer codes (assimilation schemes) on high-performance computers;\n- The development of validation and intercomparison protocols to estimate and quantify the benefits of improved assimilation methods and integration of new observations (e.g. data challenges, use of OSSEs).\nThe development of new types of observations from satellites and in-situ and the improvement of space/time sampling of existing observations require a step change in data assimilation techniques to fully benefit from these new sources of data. Current techniques are facing hard limits to progress and need new approaches to make the best use of observation and advances in modelling (e.g. resolution). Emerging coupling, multi-scale, ensemble and artificial intelligence techniques represent new opportunities for significant improvements in ocean data assimilation. The proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream applications that would benefit from these improvements.\nThe transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.\nPotential contributions to the European Digital Twin Ocean and the GEO Blue Planet initiative should also receive attention during the project, given that the CMEMS is and should remain an important player in these initiatives. International cooperation is hence encouraged in this topic.\nActions are encouraged to build on or cooperate with previous or ongoing Horizon funded projects contributing to different components of the global ocean observing value chain, for example - but not limited to - LandSeaLot, EPOC, EERIE, ObsSea4Clim, etc.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

      "scope": "The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include:\n- AI-supported retrieval algorithms on both passive and active sensing for existing and upcoming Copernicus missions;\n- Fast, reliable, consistent, and as much as possible sensor agnostic identification of clouds and shadows in optical sensing;\n- Multi-source multi-target AI models for automatic segmentation;\n- Physics parameterization and parameter optimization to emulate poorly understood processes and increase the fidelity of numerical models;\n- Fault and outlier detection in production and delivery workflows to ensure more robust services;\n- Support to automated pre-processing and QA/QC of observations and data to reduce the risk of man-made errors and product deficiencies;\n- Data fusion techniques towards added-value products;\n- Data compression and mining methods to navigate big data efficiently, as the amount of data is becoming a limiting factor;\n- Hybrid observation operator, ensemble data assimilation techniques, error calibration and uncertainty quantification towards improved (re-)analysis and forecast skill;\n- Analysis-driven Earth system deep learning models to boost prediction skill and timeliness, including with Digital Twin Earth models. These methods have shown great promises when applied to reanalyses for example;\n- Experimenting observation(-only)-driven forecasting to support time-critical service elements, circumventing analysis steps. These approaches could be particularly suited for observation-dense areas from which processes can be inferred from observations alone;\n- Exploring the potential of large pre-trained foundation models and transfer learning at scale for Earth system modelling, including with publicly available training datasets from Copernicus;\n- Downscaling and super resolution applications building on Copernicus data to refine products in space and time;\n- Adaptive workflow optimizations;\n- Enhanced interactive interfaces enabling on-demand product and service generation;\n- Chatbots that can guide the user across a wide range of information sources within and across Copernicus services for enhanced user support and experience.\nProposals are expected to address as many of the above areas as possible.\nDuring the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data volumes and computing capacities have developed at an unprecedented pace, and it is now evident that Copernicus needs to become even more proactive on the digital transition. AI and machine learning offer great opportunities across the Copernicus value chain and workflows to deeply transform its data, products, applications, services and user experience.\nHowever, the scope and speed of developments also generate challenges, in particular regarding the necessary know-how that needs to be established, the software and hardware infrastructure that need to be developed, and the integration of machine learning and conventional tools within production workflows. These challenges need to be addressed within a comparably short period of time to keep up with evolving user requirements and to leverage emerging AI/ML developments. The project is expected to foster game changer and disruptive approaches in particular towards next generation Earth system (re-)analysis and prediction systems as well as foundation models, to promote integrated AI/ML strategies and intensive cooperation and knowledge transfer with and across Entrusted Entities to pave the way into the future of Copernicus. Given the QA/QC requirements on Copernicus products, explainable, trustworthy, open-source and responsible use of AI approaches are of particular interest, as AI mainly operates as a black box. In the context of recent EU policies, a robust framework is required to ensure the same stringent quality, reliability, and verifiability requirements of AI-generated products, as well as transparency and clearly labelled information to users. Benchmarking approaches to quantify the positive impact and improvements of AI/ML methods over time are particularly encouraged.\nCollaboration with the EuroGEO initiative and the project(s) funded from the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-09: Delivering Earth Intelligence to accelerate the green and digital transition is encouraged.\nThe transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services and Destination Earth, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation.\nThe possible participation of the JRC may consist in (1) ensuring access to relevant models, tools and datasets of the operational CEMS and CLMS, (2) providing a good understanding of existing operational workflows for CEMS/CLMS and advice regarding the operational feasibility of new developments and (3) testing of new developments/prototypes for CEMS/CLMS in a pre-operational setting.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.",

      "scope": "The project should address the following points:\n- Development and demonstration of space sensors, including the assessment of their operational boundaries and associated technical confidence levels, for the following use cases: Estimation of oil spill volume and thickness, in conjunction with the identification of oil types using for instance oil spectral signatures; Detection of oil spills in sea ice conditions; Detection and identification of chemical products on the sea surface (MARPOL Annex II); Detection and identification of sewage on the sea surface (MARPOL Annex IV); Detection and identification of garbage on the sea surface (MARPOL Annex V); Detection and identification of exhaust gas cleaning system residue, and monitoring of single-vessel methane emissions (MARPOL Annex VI); Detection and identification of the possible polluter using vessel unique spectral signature; Elements of detection of other pollution emissions (MARPOL Annex VI) might prove useful and would be considered a plus;\n- Design and improvement of use artificial intelligence methods for the identification of spills, sewage and garbage on the sea surface and their characteristics to achieve a higher level of timeliness, automation and confidence (e.g. avoid false alerts).\nContext:\nThe MARPOL convention adopted at the IMO level regulates the release at sea of substances originating from ships, be it from the ship’s operation or cargo operations. The Ship Source Pollution Directive adopted in 2005 seeks to strengthen the enforcement in the EU of the prohibition of release at sea of substances under Annex I and II of the MARPOL convention. Currently, high-resolution satellite imagery of the ocean surface is used to monitor and detect potential spill, notably through the CleanSeaNet service, offered by the European Maritime Safety Agency.\nThe revision of the Directive will expand its scope to discharges in the water under all MARPOL annexes. Further research is needed to adapt the current monitoring systems to the accurate detection of the substances included under the revised scope of the SSPD as the technologies may not be available or accurate enough.\nThe objective of this topic is to support R&I activities developing advanced technological solutions, that will allow to enhance the service provided to Member States for the detection of potential spills and identification of potential polluters.\nR&I activities should complement what is currently being done by EMSA, along CleanSeaNet and the Copernicus maritime surveillance service. Moreover, the Copernicus Security Services Strategic Research Agenda (CSS-SRA) provides, on a yearly basis, an overview of R&D activities, as well as proposed actions based on latest developments. Applicants are invited to consult the corresponding additional requirements and information based on the CSS-SRA [1] and subsequent updates when they become available to develop their proposal.\nThe transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future.  Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with EMSA, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Proposals are encouraged to connect with and contribute to both the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030.\nIn this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.\n[1] JRC Publications Repository - The Strategic Research Agenda for Copernicus Security Service 2023 (europa.eu)",

In addition, they find utility in high-frequency transmitter modulators and receiver demodulators, which are essential for advancing wireless telecommunications technologies. They can also serve as integral components in optical interconnects for data centers, high-performance computing (HPCs), and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) computing systems.\nThe main objective of this topic is to explore innovative solutions based on IAMs, including 2DMs, that offer state-of-the-art performance and low power consumption, while demonstrating scalability for volume production, thus exploiting the semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. The envisioned compact devices are expected to be designed to be compatible with low-power driving electronics and thus reduce energy consumption. Solutions should be compatible with existing photonic integrated platforms and low-voltage electronics.\nProposals are expected to integrate the value chain and include relevant manufacturing technologies required to bring the developed devices to market. Prototypes are expected to be developed using packaged devices, including electronics, to enable testing in relevant environments.\nEfforts should be focused on envisioning optimized routes for electronic and photonic design, fabricating photonic circuits, producing IAMs, conducting testing, executing wafer-scale fabrication, and performing co-integration and co-packaging, ultimately leading to demonstrations of the developed technologies and their added values.\nWhere relevant, proposers are encouraged to take advantage of and connecting to European analytical research infrastructures and services such as the ones in the ARIE network [1] .\nProposals should also consider building their innovations on top of relevant existing standards and consider standardisation as part of innovation and dissemination activities.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for Europe (IAM4EU). Proposals funded under this topic are part of the IAM4EU partnership portfolio and are expected to develop synergies with the related stakeholder community and contribute actively to the objectives of the partnership. Proposals should seek collaboration, with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national, or regional initiatives, funding programmes such as the Graphene Flagship [2] for proposals investigating 2D materials. In addition, outreach to relevant national projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries is encouraged. Adequate resources for all these synergies should be foreseen in the proposal.\n[1] https://arie-eu.org/\n[2] Graphene Flagship: https://graphene-flagship.eu/",

Nevertheless, PFAS have been detected in groundwater, surface water and soil, the remediation of which is extremely problematic [7] , [8] . Their accumulation in the environment has been linked to negative effects for the wildlife and the human health, including carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic and toxic effects for the endocrine system [9] .

At least, an analysis of how the introduction of such alternatives is positively or negatively considered by users and the general population, disruptive (or not) for the established social norms or behavioural patterns, should be conducted;\n- Policy briefs will be reported to the European Commission on a yearly basis to communicate on the key results and achievements.\nProposals should indicate to which chapters of the Strategic Research and Innovation Plan for chemicals and materials [12] they will contribute.\nProposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy.\nIn accordance with the SSbD framework, this topic requires the effective demonstration of the added value of the outcomes to protect human health and the environment, e.g. in the fields of biodiversity protection, indoor and /or outdoor air quality.\nCollaboration with existing Open Innovation Test Beds (OITBs) [13] should be explored - where relevant.\nInternational collaboration is encouraged.\nThe challenge of developing PFAS alternatives should also cooperate with relevant topics under other clusters and calls of Horizon Europe ( e.g. HORIZON-CL4-2021-RESILIENCE-01-08 [14] , HORIZON-CL4-2022-RESILIENCE-01-23 [15] , HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-02-2-two-stage [16] , Horizon 2020 LC-GD-8-1-2020 [17] ), including topics under the Chips Joint Undertaking and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking ( e.g. HORIZON-JTI-CLEANH2-2024-05-02: Development of non-fluorinated components for fuel cells and electrolysers). Proposals should specifically allocate the necessary resources for collaboration with the other relevant projects.\n[1] Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006R1907-20231201\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/the-ecolabel-scheme.html\n[3] https://ec.europa.eu/environment/publications/proposal-ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en\n[4] https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en\n[5] See documents defining the SSbD framework and criteria on: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\n[6] This list of applications and functions are not exhaustive, unless explicitly mentioned.\n[7] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/european-zero-pollution-dashboards/indicators/pfas-contamination-and-soil-remediation-signal\n[8] PFAS in European seas (Signal) (europa.eu)\n[9] https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.e200418\n[10] Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - ECHA (europa.eu)\n[11] The use of (gaseous) PFAS in air conditioning is outside the scope of this call.\n[12] https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\n[13] https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/sustainable-production-processes_en\n[14] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2021-resilience-01-08\n[15] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2022-resilience-01-23\n[16] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl6-2023-zeropollution-02-2-two-stage\n[17] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-8-1-2020",

Moreover, the large-scale pilot should seek and include sufficient evidence of a clear commitment from the major European telecom, cloud and edge providers to industrialise further the results of the pilot among the major stakeholders, in particular by considering the necessary business adaptations and future perspectives, etc. In this context, an advisory group of end users should be set up to discuss and advise about user requirements to be considered in relation to the pilots. This group will collect requirements from a large range of users and test them through small demonstrations.",
      "scope": "The recent Commission White Paper “How to master Europe’s digital infrastructure needs?” highlights the convergence of electronic communications networks and cloud services, and call for the strengthening of the EU “Telco Edge Cloud” infrastructure, by creating the 3C Network (Connected Collaborative Computing).\nThe convergence of connectivity, including mobile networks (5G and 5G advanced), combined with computing environments at the edge and cloud is a unique opportunity for the European telecom industry to drive a European vision of next generation digital infrastructures and meet future processing demands of IoT and AI. Investing into future computing and connectivity paradigms will strengthen the industrial European supply side and deliver an enablement for the path towards sustainability of key sectors in the demand side.\nIncreased density of edge and cloud facilities is needed to sustain adoption of innovative and sovereign telco edge cloud technologies across Europe. Backed by ubiquitous connectivity to deliver the right performance in terms of bandwidth and latency, Europe’s infrastructure will require advanced network management and orchestration technology as well as neutral interconnection services to guarantee efficient infrastructure utilisation and enable innovative use cases at scale.\nThe 3C Network large-scale pilot (focusing on the supply side) aims at setting up end-to-end integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond. The main target is to research and validate the integration of device, network, cloud and edge computing, and communication capabilities for telco edge cloud deployments to realize a ubiquitous mesh of computing and communication resources. This will complement the Telco Edge Cloud reference deployments of Digital Europe and IPCEI-CIS and will feed into future deployment initiatives.\nTherefore, the scope for the action would be the following:\n- Researching and prototyping at scale end-to-end telco edge cloud integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity value chain and beyond, such as operators, system integrators, network/cloud/edge suppliers, experts on AI and (wireless) communication, experts on testing and validation of network technologies and services, IoT platform providers et al.\n- Developing open orchestration platforms across the telco edge cloud continuum, to support unlocking the transformative value of AI for European businesses and driving business growth in multiple industries strategic for Europe and associated countries.\n- Integrating AI solutions for optimising the orchestration of the different resources to be managed by the pilot actions, such as bandwidth, spectrum, computing, hardware, other user requirements.\n- Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of solutions and prototypes of the simultaneous use of integrated devices, edge and cloud computing and communication resources in operational environments (including both public networks and large private networks), ensuring high level of security and privacy, energy efficiency, transparency and control of the ecological footprint.\n- Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of integration of available infrastructures as cloud-edge continuum with distributed systems such as blockchain infrastructure and services, data spaces and seamless and comprehensive AI systems in the process of creation of decentralised digital infrastructure network, including the compliance with applicable EU regulations.\n- Exploration of novel approaches for cybersecurity by design and sustainability in advanced communication infrastructure.\nWith radical changes triggered by GenAI, as well as AI applications penetrating more and more industrial domains, demands for low latency are looming. The pilot should have to tackle the network evolution complementing the cloud with progress towards the edge, as well as needing reliability from the mobile networks.\nKey aspects to be researched, validated and demonstrated by the 3C Network end-to-end infrastructures include:\n- AI-enabled orchestration and quality assurance tools, algorithms and techniques which cater for hybrid multi-cloud technologies.\n- Enablers for multi-level (networks, edge, cloud, and services) federation management and interoperability.\n- Tools and mechanisms that facilitate the standardised exposure of network functions.\n- Enablement of Edge-as-a-Service approaches that effectively integrate cloud computing's multi-tenancy and resource sharing concepts into access networks.\n- Security and Compliance mechanisms targeted for telco edge cloud.\n- Tools for guaranteed end-to-end QoS and QoE across heterogeneous network, cloud and edge infrastructures.\n- Mechanisms to exploit specialised hardware and accelerators to address the strict the requirements (e.g. latency, energy efficiency) of virtualised network functions.\n- Investigation on the trade-offs associated to Edge nodes density and placement required in telco edge cloud deployments to achieve the target latency rates.\n- Lightweight virtualisation and cloud-native approaches for virtualised network functions.\n- Novel approaches to handle user mobility to ensure edge service continuity and quality of service.\n- Privacy preserving record linkage on individual citizen level and device-related level to foster meaningful linkage of data for secondary usage.\nThanks to these, the pilot and its associated research should support the emergence of telco edge cloud as-a-service approaches that successfully implement multi-tenancy and resource sharing notions from cloud computing into network infrastructure and resources. In addition, the project infrastructures should cater for the pragmatic complexities associated with the physical placement of the various types of telco edge cloud platforms (near, far, regional,) across the territory considering the necessary trade-offs between performance, capacity, and costs.\nFurthermore, the pilot should tackle the need for multi-cloud and edge service orchestration at scale, which enables workload portability across providers and technologies as well as effective service placement and lightweight and cloud-native forms for NFV and optimisation by means of acceleration, multi-cloud orchestration, multi-level federation and mobility management.\nMoreover, the technical solutions in the pilot should investigate the use of AI to handle the optimal allocation and optimisation of the operation of the digital infrastructures resultant of the combination of distributed compute and network resources of the edge cloud compute continuum in a predictive and efficient manner and at scale. These should take into consideration the appropriate QoS trade-offs in relation to bandwidth, spectrum, computing, hardware and other functional and non-functional requirements, cater for the need for AI/ML to improve optimisation of assets and process and closed-loop automation, and target development and life-cycle management of AI models and resource management tools for the optimal management of combined and converged network, cloud and edge infrastructures. It will integrate security and privacy by design into account and seek to incorporate mechanisms such as edge discovery and deployment as-a-service delivery, end-to-end network and compute performance, energy efficiency and mobility management, including the Non-Terrestrial Network component for ubiquity.\nThe pilot should provide an open, multi-supplier, multi-vendor, and interoperable Telco Edge Cloud reference architecture and ecosystem that encourages cooperation and cooperative development among all key stakeholders, with broad representation of MS/AC, owing to the joint research to be implemented. Furthermore, the pilot should define open access policies and mechanisms that aim to maximise the impact of the provided infrastructure which take into consideration the long-term sustainability and addressing different uses by industrial and research communities. When necessary, these should explore collaboration with complementary actions addressing the demand side.\nProject participants should analyse the existing standards landscape as a key state-of-the-art input when planning their project activities, and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, ANUJET, Nephio, CAMARA). The development paths of the critical technologies are expected to be merged and aligned to support the standardisation and uptake of 6G and Web 4.0.\nThe pilot should help maturing the technologies resulting from medium TRLs projects, while performing its own research towards enabling and prototyping of converged telco cloud edge platforms in operational and multi-suppliers, multi-domain and multi-tenant environments.\nThe pilot should cover research on infrastructure and platforms mid-TRLs telco edge cloud technologies, including development of telco-cloud network resources orchestration, demos, proof of concepts and early deployment of technologies.\nThe main achievements of the pilot should be showcased by means of small-scale demonstrations, that could be scaled up in future work programmes, for instance demonstrators on virtual worlds for industrial settings.\nThe pilot should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant technological sectors, including SMEs, scaleups and start-ups, as well as properly consider the demand side from vertical sectors and broad representation of MS/AC, also in view of the planned demand-side large-scale pilots. In this regard, proposals should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the participating stakeholders in developing, testing, validating, updating, maintaining and/ or using the technologies and services of the 3Cs network. The pilot’s Consortium should also define a policy on the ownership and access of 3Cs network resources and facilities, during the Horizon Europe project and beyond.\nProposals are expected to build synergies and ensure complementarities with relevant topics under SNS JU Work Programme 2022-2024, Digital Europe Programme WP2023-2024, IPCEI-CIS, Connecting Europe Facility.\nThe large-scale pilot would ideally reuse and extend relevant open-source frameworks and capitalise on existing testing and trial platforms from European or national initiatives [1] among which the IPCEI-CIS, SNS Stream C (dedicated to the development of EU-wide experimentation platforms incorporating promising 6G enablers), SNS Stream D projects (which focuses on implementing large-scale trials and targets specific verticals of high economic and societal importance), and other SNS projects, results from Open Internet Stack action, the Cloud-Edge-IoT HE projects, and the Digital Europe Programme’s Reference edge-cloud deployments, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Software engineering for AI” R&I areas, as well as research results on infrastructure and platforms. It should also establish strong relationship and collaboration with complementary EU-funded research activities, and also ensure close interaction with the relevant constituencies driving that research, including the Open Internet Stack constituencies. Relevant research from both the supply and the demand side of 3C networks should be considered in this regard, thus ensuring participation of research organisations from all across the value chain.\nFinally, digital autonomy in edge and cloud implies that computation infrastructure should be able to be sourced from European technology, including non-terrestrial network infrastructure. The subsequent step following the EU investments in processors for HPC (under the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking) is to extend its success to the rest of the computing continuum. Therefore, the project will also seek to coordinate with other EU (HE) research activities with a view to integrating new processor architectures into cloud edge infrastructures as they become available.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\n[1] Such as UNICO 6G in Spain, CAMPUS-OS in Germany, 6G Flagship in Finland, etc.",

These Open Source solutions will be integrated and tested / validated in the 3C large scale pilot.\n- A flourishing European ecosystem of contributors to digital commons– e.g., individuals, SMEs, academics - stimulated by critical challenges around sovereignty, trust, and user empowerment.\nTools, services, and insights supporting compliance with and implementation of EU legal framework e.g., EUDI, CRA, DMA, DSA, GDPR, Data Act, DGA.",
      "scope": "This action will foster an Open-Source framework, developed through commons , i.e. Open Source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key technology components for the operation of the 3C large scale pilot. They will be addressing relevant areas, structuring them in a stack and supporting the development of 3C building blocks making them available through a library of digital commons supporting applications on top of the European providers ecosystem.\nIt will mainly cover three technology areas:\n- Trust technologies such as privacy enhancing technologies, AI-based agents and trusted technologies for identities allowing exchanges across multiple 3C networks, providing the users with transparent, auditable, secure, and resilient building blocks and tools across the internet stack.\n- Network and connectivity technologies according to the identified needs of the 3C large scale pilot.\n- Decentralised technologies for an immersive world notably based on open standards ensuring interoperable flow of data and events across the 3C pilot networks and operators.\nIn order to implement the European vision of next generation digital infrastructures (3Cs networks), applicants should devise appropriate mechanisms for cooperation with the 3C pilot:\n- To ensure the integration of requirements and specifications stemming from the 3C large scale pilots.\n- To ensure the 3C large scale pilot’s swift integration of the building blocks developed by the Open Internet Stack, including envisaging mechanisms for testing and integration of the solutions.\nApplicants should provide concrete plans on how such work should be organised in close cooperation with the 3C large scale pilot to decide the building blocks that will be prioritised, facilitate their integration in the 3C large scale pilot and avoid any duplication of the work. If applicants opt for financial support to third parties, the solutions selected under the Open Calls should form a coherent portfolio and duplications should be avoided. The 3C CSA will ensure co-ordination and monitoring for duplication risks across the 3C projects’ activities.\nApplicants could also decide to select and fund third party projects, wherever required, through up to 70% of their project’s budget for financial support to third parties.\nIf applicants opt for financial support to third parties, they should target calls towards the Open-Source communities actively influencing the course of the Internet. This action is aimed in particular at leveraging the European Open Source community – SMEs, research institutes and individual researchers and developers – with solid experience with development of solutions in line with EU rules and values. The calls should aim at improving trust, transactions, decentralisation implementing optimal balance between distribution, security (including AI for security), AI usage and energy efficiency targeting climate neutrality objectives. Applicants should then also define the mechanisms for maturing third parties’ projects e.g., security and accessibility audits, packaging of the stack for easy deployment, localisation of the software in EU languages, documentation best practices, performance optimisation and advising on licensing.\nApplicants should detail the path to growth for third parties’ projects e.g., by actively animating communities, creating momentum among like-minded efforts, defining how projects will gain critical mass and what services will be provided for reaching such stage. Proposals should also detail the strategy for standardisation.\nIn addition to contributing to the 3C large scale pilot, applicants should demonstrate how the software produced will be operationalised as a stack of open libraries accessible through a common European repository and maximising re-use, reproducibility, and resilience for adopters.\nApplicants should actively manage the portfolio of funded projects and provide a coherent overall picture in relation to the 3Cs objectives, describing how mature solutions are and ensuring trusted and easy deployment capabilities for each building block through packaged stack.\nApplicants should strive for identification of common tools and stimulate maximum re-use of components coming from other funded projects e.g., interoperable identity and credential management tools, common packaging solutions, tools for decentralised social media.\nApplicants should seek active collaboration with other initiatives addressing internet commons of relevance to 3Cs at national, European levels and beyond Europe including with European technology industries.\nApplicants should demonstrate their experience and understanding of Open-Source communities and their expertise covering the full Open-Source life cycle through proven track record including years of experience and indication of volume of Open-Source projects supported.\nThe Commission considers that proposals in this topic with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\nFinancial support to third parties\nThird parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 150 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 9 to 12 months. The consortium should provide the programme logic for the third-party projects, managing the projects lifecycle, and provide the necessary technical and non-technical support: these tasks cannot be implemented using the budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.",

This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, including industry, research and academic stakeholders.\nΤhe project should take into consideration the overarching challenges of:\n- Reinforcing European leadership and cooperation in submarine cable connectivity, with European capabilities and best practices shaping future connectivity standards, promoting their secondary use (e.g. for a pre-warning system of natural hazard) as well as synergies and collaboration with CEF-Digital backbone projects;\n- A digital and green transition towards low carbon footprint of connectivity platforms through principles of the circular economy, including reduction of pollution, regenerating natural systems etc. while targeting long-term sustainability, resilience and security of submarine cable networks;\n- Ensuring resilience for the most demanding cases requiring a very high grade of quality of service (QoS) and performances, and\n- Risk evaluation, preparedness and prevention against any future natural or man-made damage or deliberate sabotage.\nAgainst this background, the objectives of the target support actions are outlined below:\n- Analysis and definition of the expected critical hardware and software components of future submarine cable infrastructure systems, and indication on where Europe should seize opportunities and strengthen its capabilities, taking into account the characteristics and architectures, including components, security, and operations of future submarine connectivity infrastructures;\n- Definition of the main required R&I work and assessment of associated research investment needs related to the identified domains;\n- Definition of an appropriate industry roadmap (SRIA), in close partnership with relevant EU actors both from industry and academia, indicating research & innovation actions to be undertaken in priority, their scope, and a timetable showing the main milestones and targets. The project could envisage organising thematic workshops to consult all interested communities. The results of this action will feed into the work of relevant groups working on submarine cable infrastructures, such as the European Submarine Cable Expert Group, the NIS 2 Coordination Group or the CER Group.",
      "scope": "- Enabling technologies applicable to submarine connectivity infrastructures and systems, including its secondary use for pre-warning systems against natural hazards, are increasingly important to ensure Europe’s strategic autonomy as well as economic security. Achieving such goals requires that Europe remains at the technological edge not only with regards to the cable technology itself but also all the other critical elements composing the submarine cable infrastructure such as repeaters, landings stations, operational control centres, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASN) or cable communications cybersecurity.\n- While some of the necessary research is indirectly conducted through mainstream research activities in generic technologies (e.g., optical communications or network management software), more specific research is needed to address the particular needs and advancement of submarine cable infrastructures and systems. However, the specific research needs still need to be identified, which supports the need to develop a specific roadmap and SRIA for research and innovation in submarine cable technologies. Such research efforts may address some of the following (non-exhaustive) domains: Multi-core fibre (MCF) technology, Digital Signal Processing, repeater systems, intelligent sensing, advanced Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS), strain and temperature sensing, oceanographic sensors for continuous, real-time trans-oceanic measurements (monitor water body), logical layer and cable network management systems, underwater robotics to improve the construction, maintenance and repair of submarine cable infrastructures, and other innovations, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) to monitor permanently submarine cable infrastructure and to detect possible threats.\nProjects are expected to develop synergies and ensure complementarities with projects under CEF Digital, the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and the Smart Networks and Services (SNS) Joint Undertaking.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.",

      "scope": "As the European Union (EU) legislation continues to expand, both in the digital (GDPR, Open Data Directive (ODD), Data Governance Act, AI Act, Data Act) and non-digital realm (e.g. green deal, due diligence, healthcare, transport), businesses and professionals face increasing challenges in maintaining compliance. Also, the complexity and volume of reporting obligations are growing, posing difficulties for both regulatory bodies to enforce laws and for entities trying to comply. These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions to streamline compliance processes and enhance competitiveness within the EU.\nAnother current challenge are limitations of real-world data such as issues with availability, confidentiality, and bias. Synthetic data is becoming increasingly vital in addressing these problems. By generating and utilizing synthetic data, actions within this framework aim to enhance data quality, diversity, and representativeness, making it a crucial tool for AI-powered innovation and regulatory compliance.\nWhere relevant, the actions should address cybersecurity, interoperability, reproducibility and standardization , and/or liaise with other actions working on those aspects, in view of facilitating effective data sharing across platforms and sectors, while ensuring an adequate level of security and protection.\nActions should provide necessary comprehensive user training and support , (also involving the users/stakeholders outside the project), ensuring adaptability and scalability to accommodate evolving regulations and diverse organizational needs and to raise awareness and improve understanding of relevant compliance issues. Proposals for all three areas should analyse and address the real needs of real users and stakeholders, and how these will be addressed in the proposed action. The training and user needs should be linked to tangible progress indicators in the proposal.\nThe proposal should clearly state (in the abstract and in the introduction) which of the following three areas it addresses. A proposal can address more than one area, but it should indicate one of them as the main focus of the proposal, and it will be evaluated accordingly under that area.\n- Area 1: Actions to develop advanced compliance technology integrating AI, cybersecurity, language technologies, and privacy preservation. This framework could include the creation of NLP [2] -driven semantic analysis tools for deciphering complex legal texts and translating them into clear compliance tasks, energy-efficient neuromorphic approaches and mechanisms for optimising massive data operations, or machine learning algorithms trained on historical data to predict and mitigate potential compliance violations. With the capability to detect changes in EU legislation, these advanced AI systems and analytics tools will provide deep insights into compliance performance, risk management, and help forecast upcoming regulatory trends to strategically prepare for future requirements. For usability, it is also important that the tools can be integrated with the organisation’s existing processes and systems.\n- Area 2: Actions to ensure auto-compliance of data transactions and data spaces with applicable regulation (e.g. data and sectoral legislation). Actions in this area should anticipate compliance tasks within the context of Common European Data Spaces and coordinate with them as necessary. Actions in this area are expected to develop automatic or semi-automatic tools that analyse and take into account the specific architecture, governance model, exchange mechanisms, tools, data types, identity management, smart contracting, user policies and other user needs or operational features of the actual data spaces, liaising with and building on other actions working in this area, in particular the Data Spaces Support Centre.\n- Area 3: Actions to generate, manage and leverage sy nthetic data in order to improve data quality, availability, representativity, fitness for purpose and compliance. The actions should in particular address the inherent shortcomings of real world data that would necessitate synthetic data (e.g. data availability, confidentiality, privacy protection, enhancing quality, diversity, representativeness, bias). Additionally, actions may target generating synthetic data for sparse or unusual domains, integrating synthetic and real data effectively, or advancing technological capabilities in generative models and simulation-based approaches to drive synthetic data generation forward and/or addressing or modelling rare events and complex dynamic systems. All actions under this Area are expected to address the evaluation, validation and benchmarking of synthetic data to ensure fitness for purpose and safe, ethical and compliant use of synthetic data, including the analysis and mitigation of biases inherited from the original data or introduced by the synthetic data generation process. For these purposes, collaboration with simulation/digital twins actions could be explored.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.\nProjects are expected to develop synergies with Digital Europe programme topics implementing Common European Data Spaces, especially the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC). Projects are expected to ensure complementarities with projects funded under the following topics:\n- HORIZON-CL4-2024-DATA-01-01 AI-driven data operations and compliance technologies (IA).\n- HORIZON-CL4-2021-DATA-01-01 Technologies and solutions for compliance, privacy preservation, green and responsible data operations (RIA).\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\n[1] FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable data\n[2] NLP: Natural Language Processing",

      "scope": "The Cloud to Edge Continuum needs to provide seamless and trustworthy integration of diverse computing and data environments spanning from core cloud to edge to IoT and support the enormous data, processing needs, and new resource types brought by next generation AI technologies.\nDifferent types of AI processes pose different requirements that compute infrastructures need to meet to execute them. The state-of-the-art in generative AI and large language models is heavily reliant on high-performance processing and very large AI models. Cutting-edge hardware accelerators that power these processing systems are scarce on the market and only available in highly specialised, high-performance infrastructures in certain cloud and HPC environments at considerable costs. At the same time, the requirement to gather, process, and transmit massive amounts of data to the central data processing environment remains a barrier for many AI applications. All these factors urge the emergence of efficient tools and mechanisms to empower the distribution of AI training and inference processes throughout the computing continuum.\nEmpowering the next generation AI technologies with on-demand, agile and situation-aware infrastructure that brings data- and computing power to where and when it is needed will let end-users exploit Artificial Intelligence across the computing continuum without compromising on security and trust and optimising their energy use. These challenges span various aspects of the continuum, including on-device data processing, data orchestration and sharing, AI integration, decentralised intelligent management, decentralized and global optimization, energy and resource heterogeneity support, data management, security/privacy, and synergies with 5G/6G. Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the vision of a cognitive cloud-to-edge continuum as a key enabler for any emerging trends such as AI/generative AI.\nThe Cognitive Computing Continuum could eventually be extended to i nclude other computational resources , such as HPC , and provide abstraction layers to maximize the benefits of available hardware.\nAddressing all the above complexities calls for innovative research to overcome these challenges. The aim is to develop generic and AI-enabled cloud-edge technologies encompassing the whole computing continuum to empower the development of AI/generative AI technologies and applications. The proposals should demonstrate the generic applicability of the proposed technological solutions across various application domains such as but not limited to, manufacturing, healthcare, robotics, transportation and smart cities.\nThe following (one or more) research areas should be addressed:\n- Development of novel mechanisms for the efficient development, deployment, and operation of AI workflows across heterogeneous and distributed infrastructures along the Edge to Cloud to HPC continuum that optimise training times, model accuracy and data management while factoring in performance metrics such as memory usage, energy efficiency, application processing and data transfer latency, and network overheads. These should factor in virtualisation and orchestration techniques that seamlessly integrate heterogeneous processor architectures and cater for the explainability of the applied cognitive optimisations.\n- Decentralised and federated computing continuum tools and mechanisms to enable distributed AI architectures. These include scheduling, orchestration, and placement mechanisms that leverage the wide range of Edge computing environments available in the compute continuum, including on-device edge. Tools and mechanisms should take into consideration - where appropriate - data security and privacy aspects. The focus is on enhancing AI process execution through techniques such as model, data, hybrid parallelism and data compression, gossip, swarm, and federated training, or conditional computing.\n- Cloud and edge processing tools and techniques to reduce AI processing power usage and emissions across the cognitive computing continuum , relying on hardware efficiency (for example, thanks to special-purpose accelerators and heterogeneous hardware processor architectures) and energy optimisation techniques, such as hardware and software approximation.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data, and Robotics.\nProjects are expected to develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and any existing or emerging Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) initiative, such as IPCEI-CIS.\nAll proposals are expected to share communicable results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.",

      "scope": "The latest developments in AI are demanding computation infrastructures designed to maximize the number of FLOPS. Europe has a window of opportunity to leverage open source and ensure that the European industry is at the cutting edge of these new processing infrastructures. The current methods and tools to develop and efficiently deliver AI pipelines and complex generative AI applications present several shortcomings.\nCurrent identified challenges include the continuous management of data pipelines, novel testing methods (e.g. differential testing or improved performance testing), optimized deployment strategies (in terms of using energy efficient resources or the best performant), management of dependencies with a diverse set of types of hardware, algorithm bias and discrimination against certain groups, determined by characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, age or disability, as well as the maintenance of the effectiveness of AI applications, notably generative AI ones. The explainability of AI models is another crucial challenge that must be also tackled at the software engineering level, possibly in synergy with explainability methods at the machine learning stage. Also, large language models and foundational models require the development and operation of complex system architectures that need to handle data processing at large scale, continuous training of models and inference. Furthermore, AI pipelines and generative AI application also strongly suffer from poor protection against learning dataset poisoning, as well as prompt poisoning; software engineering methods and tools providing support to protect against those attacks are thus direly required. This presents novel challenges for developers that will need to be addressed with the development of new methods, mechanisms and tools covering the above, including neuromorphic computing, but not limited to.\nThe main objectives for the advancements of Software Engineering in this field are:\n- Increasing the productivity of generative AI application developers, and operators, especially of foundational and language models.\n- Define a reference architecture and framework for generative AI application developers to simplify integration and system modularity.\n- Simplifying and automating the development and operation of such applications.\n- Including novel techniques for the generation of labelled training sets for reinforcement learning (RL) from human feedback, to be evaluated with corresponding RL algorithms.\n- Facilitating AI progress and advancement beyond the state-of-the-art in the EU at a faster rate vis-à-vis the rest of the world and contributing to the implementation of the AI Act.\n- Establishing collaboration with EU-based chips designers to maximize how the hardware resources are fully optimized with the software to develop\nThe proposal should address at least one use case as an industry application (e.g., automotive, health, energy, food/agriculture, etc.).\nActions could build on, provide support or seek collaboration with existing projects, develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives currently demanding this kind of optimisations possibly in different verticals: e.g. digital twins leveraging GenAI, data quality enhancement leveraging GenAI, development of energy-efficient AI algorithms.\nCommunicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA, and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nActions are encouraged to build on, provide support or seek collaboration with existing projects, develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives currently demanding this kind of optimisations possibly in different verticals: e.g. digital twins leveraging GenAI, data quality enhancement leveraging GenAI, development of energy-efficient AI algorithms. In particular, proposals are encouraged to ensure complementarities with projects funded under the following topics:\n- HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-03-01: Advancing Large AI Models: Integration of New Data Modalities and Expansion of Capabilities\n- HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-03-02: Explainable and Robust AI (AI Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)\n- HORIZON-CL4-2023-DATA-01-01 AI-driven data operations and compliance technologies (IA)\n- HORIZON-CL4-2021-DATA-01-01 Technologies and solutions for compliance, privacy preservation, green and responsible data operations (RIA)\n- HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-24 - tackling gender, race and other biases in AI.\nProjects are encouraged to develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and any existing or emerging Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) initiative.",

      "scope": "This horizontal Coordination and Support Action for GenAI4EU will develop a strong and visible European GenAI ecosystem of developers and users, aiming to strengthen the coordination, impact and visibility of the GenAI4EU initiative [1] across diverse sectors. This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, in particular those active in developing local GenAI communities, tech transfer, attracting investment, and making the European GenAI stakeholders visible.\nServing as a hub for collaboration, this project seeks to streamline efforts in developing high-impact GenAI-based applications while fostering cooperation among various GenAI stakeholders, from startups, academia and large user industries, including large IT suppliers and integrators.\nIt will support all the Horizon Europe Pillar 2 clusters, in addressing their policy needs through the implementation of the GenAI4EU initiative, in particular in supporting mechanisms to pool efficiently and make sufficient data of high quality available (in particular from the European Data Spaces, but exploiting other sources of data as appropriate), and facilitate collaboration with the AI Factories.\nThe proposed project is expected to involve close collaboration and coordination among the projects implementing GenAI4EU, developing a strong community. It should also help them to maximise their impact and increase their visibility.\nIt should also foster the uptake in all strategic application sectors, namely the ones addressed in the GenAI4EU initiative, including the 14 industrial ecosystems [2] , in stimulating collaborations between the European developers and users.\nThe selected proposal will foster collaboration between the AI Factories, the Data Spaces (as well as other data providers) and the SIMPL infrastructure, in establishing mechanisms to make data available in the AI factories, in particular for the training, and possibly fine-tuning of large GenAI models, while respecting IP or privacy/GDPR of the entities/industries providing their data. This should build on relevant initiatives, such as data intermediation services, with a view of using a trusted third party to ensure no exchanges between industry competitors for instance, while defining mechanisms to access (and if needed pooling of) critical amount of data, required for the training of very large models. This will require mobilisation of industries owning large sets of data, defining with them such mechanisms acceptable to all, and implementing them through secure infrastructures, protocols, interoperability mechanisms, within the various projects implementing GenAI4EU in the various clusters.\nThe proposal will also support Common European Data Spaces to coordinate standard setting approaches for further data sharing and data interoperability among them or with the AI Factories.\nThe selected proposal will also ensure collaboration between the GenAI4EU projects, and the relevant the AI Factories, for the computing resources, and the data spaces. Moreover, a few specific working groups among stakeholders should be established in key European industrial / application sectors (such as in Robotics / Manufacturing, Automotive, energy, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Their aim will be to bring together key stakeholders of the sector (incl. startups / SMEs and large companies) and foster discussions among them for stimulating their cooperation in developing GenAI models relevant for their sector, but also on how to address access to existing large data sets, incl. their interoperability and use for GenAI models and/or any other elements necessary for enabling an effective development and further grow of the sector’s GenAI ecosystem.\nThe proposal will also ensure connection with the AI on Demand platform providing support for fine-tuning pre-trained models and developing innovative downstream applications, the GenAI4EU Skills, and relevant activities implemented under the EU’s Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe Programme as well as national activities. The selected proposal is also expected to build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.\nThe CSA is expected to constantly monitor the way the EU GenAI ecosystem, including the AI factories, is developing. More broadly, the selected proposal will act as a global observatory for GenAI conducting a comprehensive landscape analysis of GenAI, including data on market, research, funding, patent and more broadly the state of the advancement of GenAI in the EU and worldwide. This includes an inventory of use cases, capabilities, evaluation tools and methods to assess generative AI models. The selected proposal is expected to widely disseminate this analysis at least twice a year to the stakeholders, including the EU, the Member States and Associated Countries.\nIt will also assess the uptake of GenAI by large European industry (including technology suppliers and user industry), and mobilise them to engage in GenAI4EU initiatives and drive the future strategy for the development and uptake of GenAI solution “made in Europe” in all strategic industries.\nBy identifying prioritized sectors and sharing best practices, the project aims to bridge existing gaps, connect stakeholders and foster innovation uptake.\nFurthermore, the selected proposal will assess potential areas that require further R&D, including coordination with national initiatives, to ensure comprehensive coverage and collaboration. It will actively engage in networking and community animation to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA) and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with ADRA and the funded actions related to this partnership under the call CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. This initiative will capitalise on these existing initiatives, complement them and ensure integration within the existing ecosystem developed by ADRA.\n[1] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/communication-boosting-startups-and-innovation-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence\n[2] The 14 strategic industrial ecosystems identified in the European Industrial strategy (Strategy - European Commission (europa.eu)) are: construction, digital industries, health, agri-food, renewables, energy intensive industries, transport and automotive, electronics, textile, aerospace and defence, cultural and creative culture industries, tourism, proximity and social economy, and retail",

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome: Improvement of the multimodal immersion experience combining eXtended Reality with advanced and innovative technologies.\n- Area B: Innovative photonics technologies for projection, sensing and perception in virtual worlds. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome: Improved performance of microdisplays or sensing devices serving Virtual Worlds by using innovative Optics and Photonics technologies.\nProposals are expected to focus on either Area A or Area B. The area should be clearly identified within the proposal. Special attention will be given to proposals (whether Area A or Area B) including transdisciplinary research in order to deliver and enhance uptake of suitable, accurate, ethical and safe solutions.\nProposed applications should aim at increasing awareness, acceptance and adoption of virtual worlds applications across sectors.",
      "scope": "Virtual worlds will impact the way people live, work, create and share content, the way public administrations interact with citizens as well as the way businesses operate, innovate, produce and interact with customers.\nMultimodal interaction and immersion are key dimensions of Virtual Worlds and will be supported by innovative optics and photonics technologies to achieve the full potential of Virtual Worlds core technologies.\nA broader adoption of Virtual Worlds will need better and more realistic immersion and interaction, mixing modalities, sensors and actuators for an ever-improved user experience: touch, smell, haptics, etc will be better stimulated, bringing users closer to real-world sensations, serving Virtual Worlds.\nMany challenges remain to be addressed to realize optics and photonics technical solutions that offer high-performance, excellent visual quality, high-quality user experience, and sustainable services and devices, for head-mounted displays (HMD), autostereoscopic displays or sensing devices.\nCoupled with display and sensing technologies, algorithms and metrics should be considered to exploit the underlying light (transportation) models given the utilized modality and address e.g. scene representation, content generation, compression, transmission, content reconstruction, content-to-display adaptation, or rendering. Moreover, the quality of integration, both from a user and technological perspective, will be essential for a broad adoption of Virtual Worlds.\nThe Area A proposals under this topic should develop and demonstrate novel applications for Virtual Worlds that combine several modalities and aim to provide seamless and more realistic immersive interactions. Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or push the limit of existing ones to improve the synchronization and integration of the different modalities.\nProposals should focus on an enhanced use of multimodal technologies, integrating at least two modalities within an extended reality application. Modalities include haptics and force-feedback, vision, touch, smell, speech, etc.\nThe Area B proposals should address the development and integration of advanced innovative and high-performance Optics and Photonics technologies for display and sensing devices serving Virtual Worlds.\n- For displays further improve current high-end microdisplays regarding power consumption (<1 mW), device efficiency, resolution (8K and beyond, pixel densities > 10kppi), high dynamic range (HDR), colour gamut, contrast and refresh rate holding the promise for truly immersive experiences;\n- For sensing devices improve accuracy in diverse lighting conditions and with different eye physiologies.\nSpecial attention should be given to the design and fabrication of suited waveguide optics, holographic elements, diffractive optics, reflective light guides, freeform optics (including micro-optics), or meta-surfaces with optimal optical properties and behaviour; to support the required field of view (FoV), to be lightweight and safe for the user, and provide excellent colour uniformity and high brightness efficiency; to satisfy the use case requirements for both professional use and mass adoption, i.e., be scalable to large volumes and cost-effective; to integrate targeted systems seamlessly into mixed-reality devices without increasing bulk or reducing comfort.\nFor both Area A and Area B proposals, the quality of integration, both from a user and technological perspective, will be essential for a broad adoption of Virtual Worlds. The proposals should include a focus on human perception and experience, from subjective , objective, and functional perspectives, and take into account EU values such as inclusivity, privacy, security and safety of users and the protection of their personal data, as well as diversity. Solutions should guarantee the privacy and rights of individuals and companies and ensure secure and trustworthy interactions to deliver and enhance uptake of suitable, accurate, ethical and safe solutions.\nThe Consortium should pay attention to developing solutions that are reliable, robust and interoperable. Proposals should leverage existing open standards and technologies in the domain of eXtended Reality, while contributing to ongoing standardisation work. Applications should be tested and anchored in real world environments and aimed at least one application domain.\nWe consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.\nProposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThis topic is implemented through a joint effort from the co-programmed European Partnership for Virtual Worlds and the Photonics Partnership and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with both partnerships, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-17: Specific support for the Virtual Worlds Partnership and the Web 4.0 initiative.",

Furthermore, technical solutions and services for secure and anonymous digital payments and money transfers between people, solutions for the implementation for attestation issuers and verifiers and the eIDAS trust services with a focus on the development of Open Source stacks for issuers and relying parties (for issuing and verifying electronic attestations), especially as/for cloud services. When relevant, proposals may address the validation of physical documents, either IDs or other types of identity-related documents, such as breeder documents.\nArea 2: Software Supply Chain security\nTrusted frameworks are essential to keep the software supply chain secure, as demonstrated by the recent attack on XZ Utils. The aim is to strengthen the security of the software supply chain by leveraging related NGI building blocks and package solutions for example for traceability of code, collaborative trust models among contributors and users, detection of anomalous behaviour, construction of software bill of material. Use cases include developers and users of codes, DevSecOps team, corporate IT, Open Source projects, industry and/or parties that need to be compliant with the Cyber Resilience Act.\nArea 3: Open Hardware\nOpen Hardware is key for supporting trust and sovereignty as it allows users to inspect, modify, and implement freely the designs. The aim is to support the uptake of Open Hardware chips and tools through prototyping, productization and integration in real life cases. Proposals can address several re-usable tools and components such as controllers, processors, or network chips. Use cases include consumer devices for immersive virtual worlds, industry applications, consumer devices, smart cities.\nArea 4: Alternative solutions to centralised platforms\nAs EU legislation places obligations on platforms, particularly focusing on gatekeepers, it is important to prioritize nurturing and enriching credible alternatives. Proposals in this area could cover integrating, testing and operation of Open Source decentralised solutions offering credible alternatives to users supporting the emergence of Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds experience. Examples include instant messaging, application stores, or productivity groupware that should showcase virtual worlds interoperability, trust, resilience, and scalability. The focus should be made on decentralised and federated solutions based on interoperability requirements and on open standards to ensure to not only meet regulatory demands but also foster a more open, diverse, resilient, and competitive digital ecosystem.\nArea 5: Web 4.0 demonstration for Virtual Worlds\nWeb 4.0 technologies enabling interoperability and transferability across platforms are crucial to ensure various players to contribute to virtual worlds as opposed to a mono-provider environment. This area will make use of existing Open Source building blocks for ensuring trust, interoperation, interconnection, transaction (including tokens), and resource access in Virtual Worlds applications and services. Proposals will aim at integrating the various building blocks, with a special focus on interoperability and will demonstrate seamless interactions (for example when browsing and searching across multiple providers) in one or two selected scenarios.\nFor all areas, proposals should innovate beyond the state-of-the-art and could include development, integration, testing, deployment, uptake, and operations activities.\nProposals should encourage, when relevant, open access to data, standardisation activities, as well as an IPR regime and sustainability model ensuring lasting impact and reusability of results.\nThe Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 24 to 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds.",

      "scope": "This horizontal Coordination and Support Action for GenAI4EU will develop a strong and visible European GenAI ecosystem of developers and users, aiming to strengthen the coordination, impact and visibility of the GenAI4EU initiative [1] across diverse sectors. This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, in particular those active in developing local GenAI communities, tech transfer, attracting investment, and making the European GenAI stakeholders visible.\nServing as a hub for collaboration, this project seeks to streamline efforts in developing high-impact GenAI-based applications while fostering cooperation among various GenAI stakeholders, from startups, academia and large user industries, including large IT suppliers and integrators.\nIt will support all the Horizon Europe Pillar 2 clusters, in addressing their policy needs through the implementation of the GenAI4EU initiative, in particular in supporting mechanisms to pool efficiently and make sufficient data of high quality available (in particular from the European Data Spaces, but exploiting other sources of data as appropriate), and facilitate collaboration with the AI Factories.\nThe proposed project is expected to involve close collaboration and coordination among the projects implementing GenAI4EU, developing a strong community. It should also help them to maximise their impact and increase their visibility.\nIt should also foster the uptake in all strategic application sectors, namely the ones addressed in the GenAI4EU initiative, including the 14 industrial ecosystems [2] , in stimulating collaborations between the European developers and users.\nThe selected proposal will foster collaboration between the AI Factories, the Data Spaces (as well as other data providers) and the SIMPL infrastructure, in establishing mechanisms to make data available in the AI factories, in particular for the training, and possibly fine-tuning of large GenAI models, while respecting IP or privacy/GDPR of the entities/industries providing their data. This should build on relevant initiatives, such as data intermediation services, with a view of using a trusted third party to ensure no exchanges between industry competitors for instance, while defining mechanisms to access (and if needed pooling of) critical amount of data, required for the training of very large models. This will require mobilisation of industries owning large sets of data, defining with them such mechanisms acceptable to all, and implementing them through secure infrastructures, protocols, interoperability mechanisms, within the various projects implementing GenAI4EU in the various clusters.\nThe proposal will also support Common European Data Spaces to coordinate standard setting approaches for further data sharing and data interoperability among them or with the AI Factories.\nThe selected proposal will also ensure collaboration between the GenAI4EU projects, and the relevant the AI Factories, for the computing resources, and the data spaces. Moreover, a few specific working groups among stakeholders should be established in key European industrial / application sectors (such as in Robotics / Manufacturing, Automotive, energy, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Their aim will be to bring together key stakeholders of the sector (incl. startups / SMEs and large companies) and foster discussions among them for stimulating their cooperation in developing GenAI models relevant for their sector, but also on how to address access to existing large data sets, incl. their interoperability and use for GenAI models and/or any other elements necessary for enabling an effective development and further grow of the sector’s GenAI ecosystem.\nThe proposal will also ensure connection with the AI on Demand platform providing support for fine-tuning pre-trained models and developing innovative downstream applications, the GenAI4EU Skills, and relevant activities implemented under the EU’s Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe Programme as well as national activities. The selected proposal is also expected to build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.\nThe CSA is expected to constantly monitor the way the EU GenAI ecosystem, including the AI factories, is developing. More broadly, the selected proposal will act as a global observatory for GenAI conducting a comprehensive landscape analysis of GenAI, including data on market, research, funding, patent and more broadly the state of the advancement of GenAI in the EU and worldwide. This includes an inventory of use cases, capabilities, evaluation tools and methods to assess generative AI models. The selected proposal is expected to widely disseminate this analysis at least twice a year to the stakeholders, including the EU, the Member States and Associated Countries.\nIt will also assess the uptake of GenAI by large European industry (including technology suppliers and user industry), and mobilise them to engage in GenAI4EU initiatives and drive the future strategy for the development and uptake of GenAI solution “made in Europe” in all strategic industries.\nBy identifying prioritized sectors and sharing best practices, the project aims to bridge existing gaps, connect stakeholders and foster innovation uptake.\nFurthermore, the selected proposal will assess potential areas that require further R&D, including coordination with national initiatives, to ensure comprehensive coverage and collaboration. It will actively engage in networking and community animation to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA) and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with ADRA and the funded actions related to this partnership under the call CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02.

      "scope": "Generative AI (GenAI) holds the potential of creating in Africa a rich ecosystem of transformative solutions and practical applications addressing the specific societal challenges and opportunities most of the countries are facing.\nThe proposals should address one or more of the following:\n- Agriculture optimisation: GenAI can analyse satellite imagery and sensor data to monitor state of crops, soil conditions, and weather patterns, enabling farmers to boost crop yields and enhance food security through sophisticated predictive analytics and efficient resource management like water and pesticides. This is crucial to mitigate climate change and poor irrigation infrastructures in some areas of Africa.\n- Healthcare: GenAI can diagnose diseases from medical images and patient data, enhancing healthcare in remote areas; forecast disease outbreaks and aid in preventive planning, and with the help of chatbots and virtual assistants can offer medical advice and connect patients with doctors, expanding telemedicine services, making healthcare more accessible to remote populations. Particular attention should be paid to the gender dimension in addressing AI biases, sex-specific healthcare needs, and intersecting gender and racial inequalities in health and access to health services.\n- Infrastructure and urban planning: GenAI optimises energy usage, integrates renewables, and ensures efficient distribution, while managing water (including groundwater but also rainfall use) and waste (e.g. plastic reduction and reuse) effectively for sustainability, and enhancing safety with real-time incident detection. It also provides support for reconstruction following natural or human-made disasters. This is vital for some African communities with scarce natural resources like water and facing high temperatures by using Digital Twins on urban and rural areas. All these technological solutions depend strongly on the existence and quality of connectivity infrastructure, as a key enabler for unlocking the Digital and Green Transition.\n- Digital Skills and learning: Generative AI can personalize learning paths, create multilingual educational content, and offer on-demand virtual tutoring, benefiting rural communities with low resources and fully relying on mobile phones to access online services. Additionally, adaptive learning platforms can use data analytics to tailor teaching, while engineers craft queries to help AI models understand local languages and nuances to set up conversational chatbots for local communities.\nThe proposals should approach these objectives by:\n- Conducting an evidence-based analysis to identify particular needs in Africa that GenAI technologies could solve, for one or several of the topics mentioned above.\n- Identifying solutions on GenAI developed in the EU that could be applied in Africa for one or several of the topics mentioned above.\n- Based on existing EU-based solutions and particular needs, developing and integrating generative Artificial Intelligence models and algorithms specifically adapted for one or several of the abovementioned key areas.\n- Involving and supporting start-ups and local networks in 3 to 5 locations in Africa to create innovative solutions to uniquely African challenges in those areas based on GenAI. Co-creation and living lab methodologies should be explored to boost social uptake of proposed solutions. Living labs are ecosystems of experimentation and open innovation, with a systematic approach to co-creation among their users, whether they are researchers, businesses, civil society or public administrations. These open innovation spaces will enable researchers and local actors from the public and private sectors work together using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions that respond to their societal needs, while improving territorial cohesion.\n- The approved projects should take into account the AI Act and GDPR as the main legal frameworks to ensure data protection of the data used within third countries.\nWhere relevant proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European initiatives. In particular links are encouraged with the projects funded under international cooperation on AI for public good, in the areas of health, digital twin for reconstruction, emergency response and electric grid optimisation, Destination Earth, Copernicus.",

      "scope": "Proposals integrating Generative AI in robotics and industrial automation are expected to substantially contribute to productivity gains, including for instance in engineering industries, the automotive sector, food production or other sectors related to manufacturing industries. All proposals will have to demonstrate their expected impact on the competitiveness of the selected application sector.\nThe budget will be split in a balanced way between area Type A and Type B defined below. Proposals should clearly identify the area they are addressing.\nProposals aiming for Type A outcomes should adhere to the Type A scope, while proposals aiming for Type B outcomes should follow the Type B scope.\nType A Scope: While it is widely acknowledged that current use of generative AI has the potential to impact certain tasks in robotics such as improving user interaction or providing explanations about why a robot system made a particular decision, these are, in general, not within the critical operating flow of a robot. To reach next level of autonomy, generative AI must also enable robots to learn from their experiences, simulate realistic environments for training in challenging conditions, and enhance planning, decision making and control while considering the physical constraints imposed both by the environment and by the physical construction of the robot. This includes integrating 'Human-in-the-loop' mechanisms, where AI systems collaborate with human operators to enhance decision-making processes and adaptability, particularly in dynamic environments.\nThis represents a significant advancement in robotics, requiring the development of AI models that can effectively navigate the complexities of the physical world while ensuring safety. Generative AI is expecting to bring such a step-change in robots precision, adaptability, versatility and robustness, enabling them to efficiently achieve real world tasks such as complex moves (navigation, manipulations, etc.) with higher level of autonomy and precision.\nIn the context of advancing robotics capabilities, the use of generative AI stands as a transformative force, amplifying robots’ learning, interaction, and operational abilities. By enabling robots to learn from experiences, simulate diverse environments for training, and enhance human-robot interaction, it drives adaptability and efficiency. Additionally, generative AI facilitates the augmentation of robot situational awareness and planning capabilities, empowering them to predict outcomes of various actions, thereby elevating their autonomy and decision-making prowess.\nTraining current generative AI models, in particular Large AI models, requires high volumes of data to achieve effective levels of performance. The vast amount of data required present a significant challenge when it comes to robotics. Further research is necessary to find the appropriate balance between the quality, adequacy, and volume of data with regards to the performance of the AI model. Moreover, model distillation techniques may play a key role for the portability of the generative AI solution at the edge, in power-limited devices. The training data should come from the real world or from physical aware simulations of the real world. Where relevant, in particular in the context of human interaction, training data should encompass diverse individual characteristics, such as gender, age, racial and ethnical background, to mitigate potential bias and discriminations.\nProposals should detail strategies to leverage cutting-edge generative AI techniques to enhance the adaptability and reliability of these models across complex and dynamic scenarios, as well as how to ensure human-centricity and environmental considerations. The goal is to train and fine-tune generative AI models that meet the necessary standards for ensuring the safe operation of robotics hardware. These models should empower robots to autonomously plan and execute actions while maintaining high levels of performance and generalization capabilities.\nResearch activities should explore the training methodologies for these foundation models, emphasizing their ability to process multimodal data and derive actionable insights to inform robotic decision-making processes.\nThe proposals are also expected to include the validation of the trained models through applications. Proposals should detail methodologies for conducting rigorous testing procedures, incorporating both simulation-based evaluations and physical experiments. These tests aim to evaluate the performance and scalability of developed foundation models.\nThe research will be driven by impactful scenarios defined by major manufacturing industry players who should be well integrated in the consortium. They should be deeply involved in the proposed work in order to provide the use-case, the corresponding data and they will play an important role to accompany the validation process. They will define a number of representative real-world use-cases with gradually increased level of complexity to drive the technology development. They will provide existing relevant data and collect further data necessary to train and fine-tune the models, but also to validate the solutions. Given the sensitivity of sharing industrial data, manufacturers present in the consortium have to define upfront mechanisms to collectively provide and pool a sufficiently large dataset for training the models (this might involve a trusted third party as intermediary), ensuring sufficient quality and quantity of data needed to train the models. If necessary, they will have to put in place mechanisms to acquire data from sources outside the consortium.\nProposals are expected to enhance the accuracy and robustness of generative AI systems in robotics, ensuring that the solutions developed are trustworthy and reliable in their applications, hence in line with the AI Act requirements.\nProposals should address both the safety of robotic operations, ensuring protection against physical risks, and cybersecurity measures to safeguard against digital threats and ensure system integrity.\nThe emphasis lies in creating and disseminating general-purpose models and tools rather than being limited to narrowly focused solutions. Projects should also build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European (e.g. projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-03-01: Advancing Large AI Models: Integration of New Data Modalities and Expansion of Capabilities), national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.\nType B Scope:\nThe objective is to enhance productivity and provide a competitive advantage to EU industry in the transition towards more sustainable, zero-carbon production, addressing the uncertainties and tensions on supply chains and the lack of highly-skilled workers. A new generation of digital technologies will integrate generative Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and advanced human interfaces in industry-grade applications with a high degree of autonomy. This will enable the development, production, and operation of complex and advanced high-tech products at lower cost while improving sustainability and flexibility, ultimately becoming a powerful tool for accelerating innovation in both processes and products.\nThe manufacturing sector should strongly benefit from increased levels of automation made possible by breakthroughs provided by AI, in particular by the family of technologies know as generative AI, including (e.g.) AI foundation models, large language models, transformers, multimodal generative AI. The main objective of this Type B is the development of Generative AI solutions dedicated to the manufacturing sector and making use of manufacturing data available in production lines.\nProposals should address at least one of the following use-cases:\n1) Robustness and trustworthiness of digital technologies and data management at industry-grade quality, to raise the automation levels on production sites and across industry and supply chains;\n2) Enhanced product and process qualification/certification and compliance assessment through higher levels of automation, digitalisation and data management, taking into account related requirements;\n3) Automation of manufacturing processes to achieve higher reliability, efficiency and sustainability;\n4) Automated tools for fast and large-scale deployment and reconfiguration of production assets and for rapid innovation cycles.\nProposals should accomplish these objectives exploiting the most suitable approach(es) among the ones described below:\n- The integration of applications exhibiting advanced developments of generative AI model(s) specifically designed for manufacturing, providing measurable advantages in one of more of these key areas: manufacturing cost, increased productivity, quality, flexibility, resilience, sustainability, circularity, time to market and usability. Applications can target factory-floor operations and/or management of data, knowledge and documentation associated to products and production (for use-case 1 or 2);\n- Development and integration of digital production systems capable of significantly increasing productivity and managing high-mix production with close to zero time needed for re-purposing and capability to manage different mixes of materials and components (for use-case 3);\n- Development of deployment tools to automate the management of production lines, namely through automatic configuration, integration with legacy systems, placement of data translators and connectors, and deployment of machines and sensors on the shop floor (for use-case 4).\nProposals should indicate which approach they are targeting. Proposals may combine several approaches above, indicating which is the main approach, provided there is added value in such a combined approach; arbitrary combinations without integration are excluded.\nThe use of generative AI techniques is encouraged for all the approaches. The applicants will specifically describe how they will secure the acquisition of quality manufacturing data from real-world industrial use cases of industry partners or companies outside the consortium in the context of the data volume necessary to train and finetune the models used in the proposal.\nType A and Type B\nFor both Type A and Type B projects, proposal should allocate up to EUR 30 million towards the development of the foundation model. Each project is anticipated to focus on up to six use cases.\nA minimum of EUR 10 million of the proposal budget must be allocated via FSTP for the fine-tuning phase. This phase aims to create Generative AI applications tailored to impactful industry-driven use cases.\n- FSTP may be foreseen for up to EUR 2 million per use case, either for a single company (including SME/Start-up), user industry providing their data and use-case, or to a small consortium complementing such user industry company with one or two additional partners, such as AI developer/integrator. Such FSTP initiatives will develop mini-projects, working in close collaboration with the consortium partners, that will dedicate sufficient resources to support such FSTP projects, in order to develop advanced applications and demonstrate with quantitative KPIs the power of Generative AI solutions. These mini-projects will include data preparation, fine-tuning, validation of the Generative AI solution in the selected impactful use-cases.\nProposed projects should aim to develop models that align with European values and principles and regulation, including the AI Act. Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation, particularly addressing the needs and requirements of the industry.\nWhere relevant, interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, focusing on open specifications and standards, enabling effective cross-domain data communities, and new data-driven markets.\nIf high computing resources are necessary, for both Type A and Type B proposals the primary source of computing resources for pretraining should be sought from external high-performance computing facilities such as EuroHPC or National centres. The proposal should describe convincingly the strategy to access these computing resources.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Additionally, proposals should leverage the tools available for the AI and robotics community on the AI on demand platform. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships on AI, Data, and Robotic (ADRA) and Made in Europe and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.\n[1] GenAI4EU is an initiative launched in the context of the AI innovation package, fostering the development of innovative Generative AI solutions to support the competitiveness of Europe’s strategic sectors and industries: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-ai-innovation-package-support-artificial-intelligence-startups-and-smes",

      "scope": "Fabless semiconductor start-ups and SMEs play a key role in driving innovation and economic growth within the global technology sector. These companies, which design chips and outsource their manufacturing, are at the forefront of technological advancements, fueling innovative developments in semiconductor technologies related to AI, data processing, communications, automotive, and more. Globally, fabless companies contribute to approximately 50% of chip revenues. However, Europe’s share in this crucial market is less than 1%, highlighting a significant gap that needs to be addressed to strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy and economic security. European fabless startups and SMEs often face significant challenges in accessing cohesive and timely information, financial resources, and relevant infrastructures and services. Nurturing and supporting the growth of European fabless SMEs is essential for building a competitive ecosystem that fosters rapid innovation, job creation, and sustainable growth. This Coordination and Support Action (CSA) aims to bridge this gap by providing targeted support and advocacy for Europe’s fabless semiconductor start-ups, SMEs and small mid-caps, ensuring their voice is heard and their potential is fully realized.\nThe CSA will support European fabless start-ups, SMEs and mid-caps by establishing a coordination and knowledge hub to foster collaboration, improve access to strategic resources, and bridge the gap between them and decision-making entities. The proposed actions will aim to:\n- Establish a sustainable organization or network, potentially through the formation of an open industry association, to represent the interests of European fabless SMEs.\n- Promote dialogue and advocacy between fabless SMEs and European stakeholders, including public authorities and policymakers, while representing their interests with key industrial actors (such as foundries, EDA vendors, and design houses) as well as relevant initiatives of the Chips for Europe Initiative, the Chips Joint Undertaking and the IPCEIs on Microelectronics.\n- Enhance the visibility and engagement of fabless start-ups and SMEs in EU policy-making to leverage their innovation potential, strengthening Europe’s leadership in critical industry domains and in advanced semiconductors such as for AI, HPC, quantum, communications, advanced sensing, power systems and autonomous driving technologies and applications.\n- Align with relevant support actions in key EU programmes, including coordination with the network of the European Semiconductor Competence Centres and the Design Platform under the \"Chips for Europe Initiative\".\n- Develop a central platform (a one stop-shop) for semiconductor start-ups and SMEs that aggregates and disseminates all essential information they need (e.g., policy updates, public and private funding opportunities, and technological advancements) and facilitates access to funding and investment opportunities.\n- Organize and participate in events, including workshops and conferences, to enhance the profile of fabless startups and SMEs, and strengthen their role in the broader European semiconductor ecosystem.\n- Foster partnerships and innovation through networks that connect start-ups and SMEs, promoting cross-sector knowledge-sharing and joint projects to advance technological solutions and business growth.\nThe action should be coordinated and driven by the relevant representative European start-up and SME stakeholders operating in the field.\nLinks with topics in other WPs : Chips JU WP 2024 and 2025",

      "scope": "Generative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.\nEach proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.\nUser industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.\nProposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the first two stages, third parties, either single companies (typically start-ups or SMEs) or small team of organisations built around such start-ups/SMEs, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions. After these stages, the solutions retained for the last stage will be invited to join the consortium, as full beneficiaries.\nFor each proposal:\n- Stage 1: a challenge, open to all, will allow to select for stage 2 the 20 highest ranked solutions, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single start-up/SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations built around such start-up/SME\n- Stage 2: the 20 solutions selected from stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP funding, in form of a grant, in order to address the challenge set for this stage by the consortium. At the end of stage 2, the 4 highest ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.\n- Stage 3: after the end of stage 2 and the corresponding FSTP scheme, the 4 selected solutions will be invited to join the consortium and receive EUR 2 millions grants each (as part of the eligible costs of the grant agreement) to prepare for the grand finale. The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact for the team winning the grand finale at the end of the third stage, and maximise the uptake of their solutions (for instance, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered).\nSuch multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the successful proposals, each addressing a different sector.\nEach proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, even if refinements could be further developed during the project. The proposers will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships.\nThe actions selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the Grant Agreement signature.\nFor each proposal, an amount of EUR 5 millions is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8 millions is reserved in the initial grant, to carry out the stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information, even if the details are to be further elaborated in the course of the project. Such amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of the stage 2, who will be invited to join the consortium as beneficiaries to develop further the solutions and compete for the stage 3 of the challenge.\nVisibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs and startups, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project, and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages. As part of the KPIs, efficiency gains from Generative AI should be considered, to maximize broader impact.\nWhen possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects [1] and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.\n[1] In particular, proposals in telecommunication should exploit potential synergies with projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08, HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-09 and HORIZON-CL4-2025-04-DATA-02; proposals in pharma/drug should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from Cluster 1 and IHI Innovative Health Initiative; proposals in the aerospace should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from the clean aviation JU and other similar projects/initiatives.",

      "scope": "Current large-scale AI models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that have transformed numerous fields. They excel at tasks like natural language processing, image generation, and playing complex games. However, despite these successes, current models often struggle in several key areas. They lack the adaptability to seamlessly adjust to changing conditions in real-world environments. Additionally, their reasoning abilities remain limited, when facing complex tasks that require logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, or multi-step planning. Moreover, current GPAI models frequently fail to recognise their own limitations, leading them to generate erroneous outputs when presented with queries outside their domains of knowledge. These limitations underscore the need for advancements in General Purpose AI (GPAI) that go beyond pattern recognition and towards robust, adaptive systems capable of a wider range of intelligent behaviours, for example, taking inspirations from biological and collective systems.\nTo push the boundaries of current AI technology, this topic seeks the development of groundbreaking GPAI models that combine self-supervised learning with complementary learning strategies. These strategies include hybrid learning, which integrates symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation; active learning, which allows models to actively seek information to improve their performance; reinforcement learning, which enables models to learn through interaction with their environment; relational learning, which focuses on learning from relational data structures; continual learning, which allows models to continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge without forgetting previous tasks; and evolutionary learning, which draws inspiration from biological evolution to optimize model architectures and parameters; and physics-based learning, which considers physical properties in the models’ architectures. By leveraging these complementary approaches, the aim is to create GPAI models that exhibit enhanced capabilities, overcome existing limitations, and pave the way for a new generation of intelligent systems capable of tackling complex, real-world challenges.\nThis topic prioritizes proposals that explore innovative approaches to developing GPAI models, focusing on at least one of the following key research areas:\n- Hybrid Learning Architectures for Advanced Reasoning: Development of architectures integrating self-supervised learning with symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and neuro-symbolic methods to foster robust reasoning, complex planning, and problem-solving abilities within GPAI.\n- Continual and Evolutionary Learning for Dynamic Environments: Research on paradigms enabling GPAI models to seamlessly adapt, learn from changing conditions, and retain knowledge essential for operation in dynamic, real-world environments.\n- Reinforcement Learning Integration: Research on the fusion of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to overcome challenges like non-stationary data, algorithm sensitivity, and computational cost.\n- Explainable AI and Trustworthy Decision-Making: Integration of robust XAI methodologies, exploring causal inference and counterfactual reasoning techniques to enhance transparency, accountability, and responsible use of GPAI models in alignment with European values and principles.\n- Other Novel Paradigms: Research on the combination of self-supervised learning with other learning paradigms, such as active learning, relational learning, and embodied learning, to equip GPAI models with new advanced capabilities.\nProposed projects should aim for a balanced approach between theoretical advancements and practical applications, with a strong emphasis on the development of GPAI models that align with European values and principles, including the AI Act.\nThe potential impact of this research extends beyond scientific advancements, as it has the potential to transform key European industries and sectors, including advanced robotics, personalized healthcare, mobility, manufacturing, sustainable energy solutions, and the scientific sector, and to contribute to the EU climate neutrality objective through energy efficiency. Successful projects will contribute to the development of GPAI models that enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and foster innovation across a wide range of domains.\nThis topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the necessary technical expertise. Such a collaborative approach will ensure that assessments accurately capture real-world capabilities and risks, and that the developed tools are responsive to the concerns of all relevant stakeholders.\nProposals must adhere to Horizon Europe's requirements regarding Open Science. Open access to research outputs should be provided unless there is a legitimate reason or constraint.\nAll proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include participation in international evaluation contests and the presentation of illustrative application use-cases that demonstrate concrete potential added value. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.\nProposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.

      "scope": "Current large-scale AI models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that have transformed numerous fields. They excel at tasks like natural language processing, image generation, and playing complex games. However, despite these successes, current models often struggle in several key areas. They lack the adaptability to seamlessly adjust to changing conditions in real-world environments. Additionally, their reasoning abilities remain limited, when facing complex tasks that require logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, or multi-step planning. Moreover, current GPAI models frequently fail to recognise their own limitations, leading them to generate erroneous outputs when presented with queries outside their domains of knowledge. These limitations underscore the need for advancements in General Purpose AI (GPAI) that go beyond pattern recognition and towards robust, adaptive systems capable of a wider range of intelligent behaviours, for example, taking inspirations from biological and collective systems.\nTo push the boundaries of current AI technology, this topic seeks the development of groundbreaking GPAI models that combine self-supervised learning with complementary learning strategies. These strategies include hybrid learning, which integrates symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation; active learning, which allows models to actively seek information to improve their performance; reinforcement learning, which enables models to learn through interaction with their environment; relational learning, which focuses on learning from relational data structures; continual learning, which allows models to continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge without forgetting previous tasks; and evolutionary learning, which draws inspiration from biological evolution to optimize model architectures and parameters; and physics-based learning, which considers physical properties in the models’ architectures. By leveraging these complementary approaches, the aim is to create GPAI models that exhibit enhanced capabilities, overcome existing limitations, and pave the way for a new generation of intelligent systems capable of tackling complex, real-world challenges.\nThis topic prioritizes proposals that explore innovative approaches to developing GPAI models, focusing on at least one of the following key research areas:\n- Hybrid Learning Architectures for Advanced Reasoning: Development of architectures integrating self-supervised learning with symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and neuro-symbolic methods to foster robust reasoning, complex planning, and problem-solving abilities within GPAI.\n- Continual and Evolutionary Learning for Dynamic Environments: Research on paradigms enabling GPAI models to seamlessly adapt, learn from changing conditions, and retain knowledge essential for operation in dynamic, real-world environments.\n- Reinforcement Learning Integration: Research on the fusion of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to overcome challenges like non-stationary data, algorithm sensitivity, and computational cost.\n- Explainable AI and Trustworthy Decision-Making: Integration of robust XAI methodologies, exploring causal inference and counterfactual reasoning techniques to enhance transparency, accountability, and responsible use of GPAI models in alignment with European values and principles.\n- Other Novel Paradigms: Research on the combination of self-supervised learning with other learning paradigms, such as active learning, relational learning, and embodied learning, to equip GPAI models with new advanced capabilities.\nProposed projects should aim for a balanced approach between theoretical advancements and practical applications, with a strong emphasis on the development of GPAI models that align with European values and principles, including the AI Act.\nThe potential impact of this research extends beyond scientific advancements, as it has the potential to transform key European industries and sectors, including advanced robotics, personalized healthcare, mobility, manufacturing, sustainable energy solutions, and the scientific sector, and to contribute to the EU climate neutrality objective through energy efficiency. Successful projects will contribute to the development of GPAI models that enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and foster innovation across a wide range of domains.\nThis topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the necessary technical expertise.

      "expected_outcome": "Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs) [1] need to adapt to new market realities in the circular economy, driven by the search for new market opportunities (e.g. secondary raw materials market, business models addressing change in consumption awareness, and technological developments improving productivity). To achieve this adaptation, investment in R&D capacity and technology for SCEs is essential. Besides further developing its offer towards consumers, SCEs are increasingly focussing their activities towards B2B markets, such as for secondary raw materials. In that regard, SCEs started to explore the growing and labour-intensive market of sorting, recycling and upcycling services for other businesses. Research and innovation can accelerate this potential and is most needed in the area to remain competitive. Moreover, research and innovation in this sector can lever potentials beyond productivity and competitiveness, as SCEs pursue a triple impact: economic, green (contribute to a circular and resource efficient economy) and social (employment of vulnerable groups).\nThe following outcomes are expected for SCEs and wider circular networks:\n- Improve the uptake and scale of technology solutions in individual SCE and promote shared technology development and engineering through SCE clusters.\n- Improve competitiveness through enhanced productivity, as well as new market opportunities, for SCEs related to specific waste streams with potential for competitive advantages, such as, textiles, WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) and construction materials;\n- Prove technical, economic, and environmental excellence of SCE in (local) circular value chains (e.g. I-US) leading to increased collaboration with (mainstream / for profit) industrial partners;\n- Contribute to the reduction of non-recyclable waste generated in the region/area of the cluster by contributing to the re-using and transforming waste, by-products, and side-streams into new/secondary resources of raw materials;\n- Increase employment of persons with a distance to the labour market in SCE and improve their labour productivity, for example by using assistive technology in the work process and use of data (e.g. AI trained assessment and instructions).",
      "scope": "Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs) have been pioneers in the circular economy since decades. They are active in all stages of the circular economy and deal with various waste stream. SCEs are also known to offer new and innovative circular business models and brining new circular services and products to the market. In the last decade SCE also entered the market of secondary raw materials by collecting and dissembling various products and goods. The majority of SCEs are SMEs and offer local employment opportunities to vulnerable groups (99%) [2] . On average, a circular social enterprise creates 70 jobs per 1,000 tons collected with a view of being re-used.\nProjects are expected to research and develop a replicable tech-oriented demonstrator(s) within social circular clusters. Within a demonstrator, partners are expected to jointly adapt, design, test and implement relevant technology solutions. The following specific activities are expected within demonstrators:\n- The demonstrators are supposed to organise as a Social Circular Tech Cluster allowing to pool resources and adapt, develop and test technology solutions. This will facilitate more business opportunities (tech based spin-offs) and sharing of expertise with relevant industries.\n- A demonstrator consortium should be active in at least two Member States or Associated Countries and can choose to focus on textile and construction waste or WEEE. Each demonstrator consortium exists out of two or more clusters, each grouping individual SCEs (ideally with different degrees of maturity [3] ), for-profit circular companies (e.g. sectoral peers in secondary raw materials industries), research, and tech centres able to support SCE with relevant technology and research capacity. SCEs should form the core of the consortia, and should benefit directly from the interventions to improve their triple impact model. Public authorities and SCE federations could engage where appropriate. Demonstrator consortia should to be transnational in order to compare pilots in different markets.\n- Adapting, designing and developing technologies in SCEs needs should focus on optimising efficiency [4] in management and processing of waste streams and enlarge the potential market activity of SCEs in the circular economy (WEEE, textiles and construction focus). Relevant technologies should improve the productivity and innovation capacity within SCE and consequently the market position in the secondary raw materials markets. Technologies can include data driven technologies such as AI to improve sorting knowledge and decision making (screening based on automated recognition with cost-benefit analysis), software to standardise repair operations and instructions, improve stocks management and increase reuse sales by optimising the pricing system (e.g. automated value calculation of incoming materials and goods), digital modelling tools (including material passport), etc.\n- Research could also include the potential of assistive technologies to support employees (mostly persons with disabilities, specific impairments, or social disadvantages) in SCE in order to improve their productivity and wellbeing.\n- Market research focussing on improving the position of SCE as an attractive partner in management and processing of waste streams (in terms of textile, WEEE and construction materials) with most potential for growth in B2B markets. For example focussing on collection, disassembly, sorting, purification, concentration, recycling, exchanging or preparation, for the valorisation of waste to be used as feedstock for other plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains. This market research can include specific sectoral assessment of economic potential for most labour-intensive circular activities.\n- By organising through clusters, demonstrators are motivated to develop shared engineering activities (labs, strategies and shared technology) to make technology accessible for enterprises with less capacity and resources and to reduce overall costs for individual SCEs.\n- Where relevant, proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and funding programmes. In particular, the project could build further on relevant knowledge, tools, methods and technology developed and applied within existing H4C (Clusters for Circularity) and its knowledge platform.

      "scope": "The recycling of end-of-life materials into valuable materials that can replace primary raw materials requires integrated systems from the collection to dismantling and separation to their final processing. The technologies and implementation (including logistics and economics) of such circular schemes should be addressed in an integrated way. The innovation needed will depend on the addressed waste category. However, even if the upcycling technologies and implementation may be sector/material specific, the cross-sectorial elements are important and should deserve due attention.\nProposals are expected to address all of the following:\n- Develop processes for the upcycling of end-of-life materials in an integrated way, including the development of better novel separation, sorting and processing technologies as well as digitalisation and automation of the processes as necessary;\n- Integration of technologies and logistics systems into business models of circular schemes;\n- Focus on processes and secondary raw materials which offer the highest additional upcycling potential and accordingly develop novel upcycling technologies and processes including purification technologies;\n- Identify the likely impacts of the upcycling solutions with respect to economic and job creation potential, as well as environmental footprint referring to the full set of planetary boundaries including freshwater intake aspects;\n- Where relevant, minimise the presence of substances of concern to mitigate the impacts of multiple recycling loops as well as the accumulation of additives and trace materials in secondary resource streams;\n- Consider advanced monitoring and sensing along the value chains and improved data completeness, accuracy and interoperability between the process and recycling companies. In this context, digital tools, such as a Digital Product Passport for tracking and tracing of materials throughout the lifecycle of a product should be applied and data sharing should be addressed.\nProposals should include techno-economic and life-cycle assessment of the overall process (including of the carbon footprint) and demonstrate the economic viability of the approach. This can be combined with an analysis of the effect of regulatory changes and demand side stimulation measures.\nProjects are encouraged to integrate existing Hubs4Circularity [1] as nodes in the value chains. Proposals should actively pursue the involvement of all actors in the value chain from the process industry to designers, operators, formulators, recyclers, public authorities, and standardisation actors.\nAdditionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented associating social partners where relevant. Particular attention should be given to the cooperation with existing initiatives having developed education- and skills activities and outcomes in this area.\nProposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe.\nUnder this topic, it is envisaged to include support for the recovery and upgrading of industrial infrastructure in Ukraine, and for this reason at least one proposal meeting the criteria set out in the specific conditions will be funded. However, it is not mandatory to include such support in a proposal.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European partnership Processes4Planet.\n[1] Hubs4Circularity (h4c-community.eu) , Horizon Europe strategic plan 2025-2027-KI0223326ENN.pdf (page 94)",

Mistakes and delays in construction works can lead to negative consequences such as risk of accidents, waste, pollution, inefficiency and financial consequences.\nConstruction works need to be carried out more quickly and efficiently, with less room for error and waste. This could be improved through technology-driven innovations linked to on-site operations and logistical aspects.\nProposals should:\n- Develop technologies that improve the efficiency of operations on the construction site, leading to more productive, faster and more efficient working practices. The technologies should be interoperable with, or build upon existing industry-wide practices, such as Digital Twins and Building Information Modelling tools. Speed and efficiency improvements should not be at the expense of safety.\n- Address the traceability of construction products and other items delivered to the site, installed on site, and removed. If relevant, this can also include coordination with other operations outside the construction site boundary.\n- Integrate circular economy approaches, such as waste prevention and the management and recovery of construction and demolition waste;\n- Address new ways for site operations to reduce the chances of errors and accidents/taking better account of unexpected disruptions;\n- Address human-centric and Social Science and Humanities (SSH) aspects of technologies or tools that are developed. Take into consideration potential social innovation mechanisms that can facilitate the market uptake of the developed tools.\nProposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.\nProposals may choose to contribute to relevant European standardisation efforts.

In addition, during the third instalment, the partnership is also expected to contribute to the objectives of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and of the European Climate Law.",
      "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Biodiversity Partnership Biodiversa+ identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and implemented under the previous topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation. It is expected that the partnership’s additional activities will contribute to the objectives of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and of the European Climate Law by developing innovative solutions for the restoration of ecosystems that can maintain and enhance natural carbon sinks and by further developing nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation measures.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded annual calls in years 2021-2024 based on this planning and further to topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe scope of the application for this call on the European Biodiversity Partnership Biodiversa+ should focus on the flagship programmes 2025-27 according to the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years, which includes calls for research projects, biodiversity- and ecosystems monitoring and science-based policy advisory activities, and all horizontal activities to allow the Partnership to operate and to achieve its five specific objectives.\nIt is expected that the partnership continues to organise joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects. It should build on, and widen, the data availability in European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud.\nThe partnership should collaborate closely with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora. The partnership should also seek to collaborate with EU space programmes (Copernicus, Galileo) to foster the use of emerging or operational space technologies for policy development. Moreover, the partnership should describe specific activities foreseen in order to strengthen the complementarities with other related Missions and Partnerships.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18, and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18, and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and any additional partners to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.\nThe partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.",

      "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 set the following targets for 2030: significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored; habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend. The EU Nature Restoration Regulation establishes a framework within which Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, at least 20 % of land areas and at least 20 % of sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. The European Climate Law requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in which they should promote nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation. It notably acknowledges that forests are carbon sinks, which contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, while ensuring that forests continue to grow and provide many other services.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to set up living labs which will develop and widely deploy innovative solutions for restoring key ecosystems, which deliver multiple ecosystem functions and services relevant for climate action, including carbon sequestration, regulating water regimes, and other climate adaptation aspects. Proposals under this proposal are expected to combine research on forest and freshwater ecosystems.\nProposals should apply the three main principles of the living labs research concept: (a) co-creating innovative solutions in real-life sites focusing on end-users’ needs; (b) co-deciding / co-creating with end-users all along the project; (c) bringing together actors with complementary knowledge in a targeted combination as best suited to achieve the expected outcomes/objectives of the projects.\nLiving labs should correspond to the definition of the European Network of Living Labs and involve partners from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors that are most relevant to achieve the project objectives and be composed of at least seven experimental sites. By working together in a living lab, the various partners involved in the different sites will be able to co-develop, experiment, test, replicate and benchmark innovative actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting.\nMore specifically, proposals should:\n- set up at least three living labs to work together on ecosystem restoration, covering forests and freshwater ecosystems. The living labs are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and among the various stakeholders within the living labs;\n- establish a detailed work plan of the activities to be undertaken in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions\n- conduct participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs with the objective of finding practical solutions to ecosystem restoration, while considering relevant drivers of biodiversity loss, in particular climate change and invasive alien species, and related pressures. Challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions should be addressed. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating and should consider the cultural and natural heritage. Sites should be selected along a gradient of anthropogenic pressure to evaluate restoration challenges in heterogeneous areas from highly disturbed to relatively intact areas. Action oriented and collaborative approach combining local expertise in economics, ecology and locally created sustainable innovations to capture the full range of knowledge in addition to scientific knowledge should be sought. Gender dimension should be integrated;\n- establish for each living lab a satisfactory level for ecosystem condition, in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes and a clear monitoring of progress towards the objectives. Where relevant, the overall objective should be to reach the good conservation status defined in the Habitats or in the Water Framework Directives. Impacts of forestry and forestry practises on freshwater ecosystem health and how changes in forestry practises/management can support the restoration of freshwater ecosystems, including sediments, should be considered;\n- monitor and carry out an assessment of the innovative practices for ecosystem restoration and their effectiveness, including the conditions for non-deterioration. This should include a demonstration of the economic viability of the proposed innovative solutions for the end-users and appropriate business models and actions possibly involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs should be developed, including with co-funding schemes;\n- document the newly developed solutions in an intuitive and accessible way and widely disseminate them in order to facilitate their uptake by practitioners and transmit the acquired knowledge to all relevant actors.\nProposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora. Nature-based solutions are relevant to this topic if they concern the restoration of ecosystems.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.",

It will thus contribute to the objectives of the European Climate Law on nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- capacity for citizen engagement in biodiversity observation is enhanced and contributes to the development of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures at local level;\n- citizen science initiatives on biodiversity are promoted and coordinated by citizen science experts (taxonomy, genomics, IT, education and communication experts) and their outputs better harmonised;\n- citizen science approach is better integrated in taxonomic networks and communities, supporting modern taxonomic research and resolution of pressing ecological challenges;\n- systematic biodiversity observation is established (including citizen science and environmental observations), covering also little-known taxonomic groups and going beyond what the current policy is covering. Specifically, the possibilities of using citizen science data for monitoring ecosystem dynamics in time and for modelling the effects of the drivers of biodiversity loss, notably climate change, on species distribution are enhanced.",
      "scope": "Citizen science is key to gather in situ biodiversity data, which complement official/national data collection programmes. The role of European citizens, including young people, in the generation of knowledge on biodiversity, ecosystems and their provision of essential ecosystem services to society needs to be strengthened on the basis of best practices. There are hundreds of citizen science initiatives across the European Union, managed and/or funded by EU, national or regional authorities, NGOs, municipalities and others. Data are not always collected and/or presented in a harmonised way, preventing their best use. Many lesser-known species are overlooked, as well as some opportunities (e.g. collaboration with key stakeholders such as farmers, foresters, fishers, hunters, urban planners). A coordinated approach, at the level of the EU, is necessary to tackle some specific issues such as challenges in nature management, state of plant health, spread of invasive alien species, changes in species distribution or migrations due to climate change or as result of human activity (e.g., transport, agriculture, industrial production).\nActivities under this topic are expected to:\n- analyse all tools available for citizen science on biodiversity (taxonomy fiches, schoolkits, App, use of e-DNA kits, artificial intelligence, etc), collect best practices and propose/identify, if necessary, new ones in collaboration with taxonomy, genomics, IT, education and communication experts;\n- develop strategies, roadmaps and guidelines and test them to scale up citizen engagement in biodiversity observation, including a review of good practices for setting up a system of incentives to attract and retain citizen interest. The development and tests on the ground should be based on tools and protocols for data quality assessment, control and validation, consider data need scenarios (e.g. types of data used by Environmental Authorities and bodies providing scientific advice to policy makers on environmental aspects) and involve potential users (e.g. schools, stakeholders, young citizens, NGOs, civil society organisations as well as hard-to-reach and vulnerable citizens/groups);\n- develop outreach activities and materials on the crucial importance of biodiversity and biodiversity observation for climate change mitigation and adaptation;\n- identify frameworks for harmonisation and standardisation of citizen science protocols for data collection, validation, storage and sharing, as well as frameworks for interoperability of various digital tools (e.g. smart phone applications) used by citizen scientists. Attention should be paid to metadata and accessibility and transparency with regard to reference documentation, taking into account the multilingual nature of citizen science activities. Cyber security and personal data protection aspects should be considered;\n- explore avenues to streamline development of essential resources for setting up and running citizen science initiatives, including kits for collection of biodiversity data, promotion and awareness raising toolkits, training schemes, applications, multilingual protocols and participation certification for diverse target groups including children and young people.\nThe support and early involvement of citizens and civil society is central to achieving the targeted outcomes. The proposals should focus on all potential groups of stakeholders and citizens including vulnerable groups, such as young people (including those not in education or employment), elderly people, migrants, ethnic minorities, pregnant women, and persons with disabilities.\nIt is expected that the proposed activities cover terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, and that the activities will contribute to the objectives of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and thereby also to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.\nThe proposal should foresee cooperation with the European Biodiversity Partnership Biodiversa+, the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora. The proposal should also foresee cooperation with the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN), the upcoming pilot on the EU Biodiversity Observation Coordination Centre (EBOCC), national biodiversity monitoring hubs, and national statistical offices to explore and advance the collection of citizen science observations.\nThe selected project should coordinate with other projects working on citizen science for biodiversity [1] , the European Citizen Science platform [2] and relevant organisations as the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA), to ensure the exhaustive overview of all citizen science initiatives across the EU.\nThe selected project is also expected to collaborate with the projects selected under the topics HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-03: Strengthening taxonomic approaches for biodiversity and HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-04: Large-scale in situ biodiversity observations for better understanding of biodiversity state, drivers of its decline and impacts of policies.\nThe use of AI could be considered for the analyses needed under this topic.\n[1] Projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-02, HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-03, HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-01.

      "expected_outcome": "In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the common agricultural policy, the EU climate policy and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, a successful proposal will contribute to the expected impact of this destination by supporting the adaptation of agricultural production to the effects of climate change, increasing biodiversity in agroecosystems, and promoting low-input practices, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems and safeguarding food security.\nProjects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- deeper knowledge and characterisation of relevant traits for tolerance and resistance to multiple stresses, whether occurring simultaneously or sequentially, are more accessible to researchers and breeders;\n- the identification of local varieties with high plasticity to cope with multi-stress conditions is enhanced, along with the development of agro-ecological practices that improve stress tolerance while supporting biodiversity-friendly cropping systems;\n- the capacities to evaluate the effects of multiple stresses in crops by researchers and breeders are strengthened;\n- information and recommendations on variety performance and practices to cope with multi-stress are available to advisors and farmers.",
      "scope": "Crop production faces significant challenges due to climate change and the need to adopt low-input practices, including efficient water use, to reduce the environmental impact while ensuring food security. Issues such as salinity, extreme weather conditions like droughts, waterlogging, high temperatures, and emerging patterns of pests and diseases severely impact crops, resulting in reduced productivity and yield losses. Crop responses to multiple stresses differ from their responses to single stresses. Therefore, attention should be given to enhancing crop tolerance to combinations of multiple abiotic and biotic stresses, thus better reflecting real-life agricultural conditions.\nTo address these challenges, it is crucial to evaluate local crop varieties, which are often better adapted to specific environmental conditions and stresses. Identifying local varieties with high plasticity enhances crop resilience and agro-biodiversity. Developing agro-ecological practices to improve stress tolerance will further support these efforts, promoting low-input practices and enhancing the overall adaptability of agricultural systems. Additionally, broad-spectrum strategies for improving stress tolerance in crops should be developed. Smart and future-proof breeding programmes need to systematically consider characteristics that enhance crop resilience and adaptation to these demands.\nProposals should:\n- provide insight into the range of mechanisms and traits that underpin crop responses to multiple stresses, whether occurring simultaneously or sequentially, guiding the development of varieties and a crop system better equipped to withstand abiotic and biotic stresses, including reduced agricultural inputs;\n- increase understanding of the causality between abiotic and biotic stress factors and propose strategies to improve multi-stress tolerance;\n- integrate advanced technologies to assist in evaluating GxExM (Genotype x Environment x Management) interactions in the context of multi-stress, combining multiple \"omics\" data sources, high-throughput phenotyping, computational modelling and artificial intelligence, to evaluate at different levels (e.g. greenhouses, experimental fields, production fields). This integration should assist breeders in developing local varieties optimised for sustainability and climate change adaptation;\n- develop location-specific breeding strategies and agroecological practices, incorporating models and artificial intelligence approaches for prediction of cropping systems output, under multiple stress conditions considering climate change scenarios and climate analogues. These strategies should promote agrobiodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem services;\n- deliver robust methodologies for benchmarking and communicating the performance of crop varieties when they are challenged by multiple stresses.\nProposals should provide a clear explanation and justification for the selected crop(s) in alignment with the proposal’s objectives and the topic’s expected outcomes, considering as well that activities should be carried out in a range of agronomically relevant pedo-climatic conditions. All farming systems and approaches are in scope. If proposals address organic farming, particular attention should be given to aspects related to organic varieties and organic heterogeneous materials.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate tools to evaluate GxExM interactions in the context of multi-stress. A maximum of 20% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted.\nProposals should ensure coherence and complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects, including the agroecology partnership, and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects. Collaboration with European research infrastructures such as AnaEE-ERIC, EMPHASIS or other relevant research infrastructures [1] is encouraged.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/.",

      "expected_outcome": "In supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, and in particular the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, successful proposals will contribute to the impacts of this destination, notably to a better understanding of the ongoing biodiversity crisis and its consequences, the benefits of ecosystem services and the need to protect and restore them. Successful proposals are expected to support the implementation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and of the European Climate Law which requires Member States to promote nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- competent authorities in charge of the design and implementation of biodiversity policies at all levels have more high-quality data and information from in situ biodiversity observations to understand the biodiversity state and trends in the EU and in Associated Countries;\n- more high-quality data and information from in situ biodiversity observations is available to evaluate the effectiveness (in terms of biodiversity related objectives) of policies and business activities and for applied research and innovation.",
      "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 sets the following targets for 2030: significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored; habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend. The EU Nature Restoration Regulation establishes a framework within which Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, throughout the areas and ecosystems within the scope of this Regulation, at least 20 % of land areas and at least 20 % of sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. At global level, the EU has taken commitments reflecting the EU targets with the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law requires Member States to promote nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation when preparing their adaptation strategies and plans, and therefore it is crucial to improve the knowledge of biodiversity status and trend to select the most appropriate adaptation measures at local level.\nHowever, knowledge of the state and trends of biodiversity and ecosystems in the EU is insufficient to enable a robust measurement of progress towards the EU and global commitments and targets. To fill these knowledge gaps, robust data and information on species and habitats have to be generated in different climate zones. Large-scale in situ observations are essential to deliver such data and information with adequate quantity and quality. Besides improved understanding of the state of biodiversity and ecosystems, better in-situ data on species and habitats, coupled with other data sources, will also enable better identification and quantification of the effects of drivers of biodiversity decline, impacts of policy actions to mitigate those effects and overall progress made under the green transition. High-quality in situ data is also essential for building and updating reliable indicators and models, their validation and improvement, as well as the validation of newly developed observation techniques.\nR&I activities should:\n- prepare harmonised or standardised frameworks for the execution of biodiversity observations and apply state-of-the-art protocols of the utilised sampling techniques, in order to ensure the quality and interoperability and public access of the collected data. Particular attention should be paid to comprehensive and robust metadata. In particular a comprehensive coverage of the territory of EU Member States should be sought;\n- undertake systematic large-scale in situ observations of biodiversity in order to a) record occupancy, richness and abundance of species and populations, b) map species, populations and habitats, and c) survey habitat composition and structure. In this regard, the activities should generate data of adequate spatial and temporal granularity spanning multiple geographical scales to capture the variability in biodiversity across different contexts. The activities should cover species and habitats in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, including lesser-known taxa, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity across diverse ecological and geographical settings;\n- define the methodology for applying specific data quality checks;\n- ensure that the collected data which is relevant for future projections are properly defined and fit for modelling (in particular in the context of the activities under HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-05);\n- based on the undertaken observations: assess the state, geographical distribution, phenology and trends of observed species populations; assess the quality, structure, functions and geographical distribution of observed habitats; fill species and habitat data gaps in terms of geographical coverage in the EU and in Associated Countries, as well as the data gaps in terms of taxonomic coverage.\nThe use of AI could be considered for the analyses needed under this topic. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, EMBRC, eLTER and MIRRI-ERIC [1] to store and give access to research data could be considered where relevant.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, undertake in-situ observation on specific habitats and species. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted.\nProposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora. Proposals should also show how the planned activities could provide timely information for consideration by the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\nProjects will be asked to cooperate with projects that will be selected under the following topic under this call: HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-05: Assessing and modelling ecosystems’ dynamic processes to guide restoration activities and to improve models used for climate.\n[1] And any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).

The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nFor both areas, R&I activities should:\n- develop a model as described above capable of simulating dynamic ecosystems processes, including interactions at different scale levels, based on literature review, available datasets or data-basis, realised restoration activities, on-going projects including demonstration cases, and existing guidance. The model should be able to estimate ecological reference values tailored to the specificity of ecosystems in different territories and in given contexts including under climate change, to assess proposed restoration pathways and to contribute to improve/expand other models;\n- prioritise ecosystems corresponding to synergies identified between ecosystem restoration and one or several of the following areas: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, land degradation neutrality and disaster risk prevention;\n- address data gaps with direct observation if needed;\n- formulate practical guidelines or advice for practitioners about how to carry out restoration, including when dealing with invasive alien species;\n- aim at improving and expanding models used for climate and land-use policies, by coupling modelling functionalities as described above.\nProposals should build on the results of relevant existing projects and envisage enough resources to collaborate with other selected projects under this topic to provide an effective integration of the generated models.\nProposals should build on the knowledge compiled in the assessment reports produced by the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), including the IPBES scenarios and models assessment, and should show how the planned activities could provide timely information for consideration to future reports.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly in the context of real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation.

The research will contribute to the objectives of the European Climate Law, which requires Member States to promote nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- increased protection, restoration, and resilience of coral reefs and associated ecosystems in both protected and non-protected areas, acknowledging the objectives of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies;\n- effective management and land-sea planning of those associated ecosystems are based on approaches considering them together and integrating field experience with state-of-the-art and indigenous populations & local communities (IPLC) knowledge into hands-on guidelines;\n- international initiatives are supported in the effort to coordinate and reduce the fragmentation of the current landscape of interventions and resources for the conservation and management of these ecosystems. The capacity for a durable intervention is built in outermost regions, overseas countries and territories of the EU and in third countries, in particular Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.",
      "scope": "Coral reefs and seagrass beds represent about less than 1% of the ocean’s surface and mangrove cover about 1%. They are home to at least 25% of known marine species and supporting up to 40% of fish species of the global ocean through food webs and nutrients cycles. About half of the coral reef ecosystems have disappeared since the 1950’s, 29% of the known areal extent of seagrass has disappeared since the initial records from 1879 and about 35% of the original mangrove area was lost by the end of the 20th century, as consequences of direct drivers at play for the past decades (pollution, extraction, overfishing, harmful fishing practices, coastal development, deforestation), invasive alien species and now additionally from increasing climate change impacts (rising sea surface temperature, marine heatwaves, sea level rise, deoxygenation, acidification, etc.). Providing multiple ecosystems services and benefits for people, research, conservation and management efforts have increased in the recent years but often targeted these systems individually, with various duration and focus and long-term observation and management.\nWhere they co-occur, coral reefs (including mesophotic extensions), mangroves and seagrass beds share tight ecological connections. Recent observations during coral bleaching events suggest that jointly protecting mangroves, seagrasses, and reefs may synergistically increase the success and benefits of conservation due to positive feedback at habitat boundaries. However, an integrated land-sea planning and management remain challenging because of knowledge gaps in their functional ecology and connectivity, in the spatial extents of their interactions, their seasonal patterns, the socio-political decision-making contexts for local / national planning at sea or on land, and the scarce access to knowledge, experience and to spatial data. Most of past and ongoing interventions are isolated from one another, displaying a fragmented landscape in terms of approaches, of targets, of resources and by limited recognition and inclusion of IPLCs traditional stewardships of these coastal ecosystems. Based on IUCN protected area dataset, only 18% of coastline where mangroves, seagrasses, and reefs interact are protected. Nevertheless, these data set underrepresents areas managed by IPLCs, which manage or have tenure rights over at least ~38 million terrestrial km2 worldwide.\nIn particular, proposals should:\n- where shallow coral reefs (including mesophotic extensions), mangroves, and seagrasses coexist and interact: provide an improved understanding of the functional ecology, their species assemblages' and communities, their connectivity through life cycle stages and food webs structures and complexity in the healthy functioning and co-evolutionary processes of these ecosystems and in the biogeochemistry of sediments and their impact on climate change mitigation and adaptation, in order to design and inform effective management and restoration measures;\n- look particularly at functional groups in maintaining the health, as well as the potential of adaptation to changes of corals assemblage, mangrove and sea grass beds, in particular top predators, reef sharks and species controlling algae proliferation and possible IAS and climate change. Proposals may also look at the role of the microbiome, periphyton or symbionts associated to shallow and mesophotic corals ecosystems healthy functioning;\n- better understand the consequences of loss of coral reefs (including mesophotic extensions) and associated ecosystems, both in terms of coverage and diversity, on food web locally and cascading on distant communities and of socioeconomic impacts;\n- combine different scientific disciplines, and where relevant, possible active restoration measures (coral cuttings or larval propagation on the reef or artificial structures, fishing management, acoustic assisted fish recruitment in restored areas, etc.), for developing approaches for their effective management and restoration, based on functional targets, (departing from usual approach focusing on a single species and coral cover or biomass), so as to support coral reefs and associated ecosystems, mangroves & seagrass beds complexity and connectivity as best asset for their (climate) resilience, co-evolutionary processes and adaptation potentials;\n- jointly develop management and restoration guidelines with IPLCs knowledge, state of the art science and integrating lessons learnt and legacy from past and ongoing relevant initiatives from research to aid projects at regional, national, EU (such as the FPI Governance MPA Atlantic & Southeast Asia or the BEST initiative - Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of European overseas) or international levels and consolidate a community of practice in socio-ecological management in networks of protected area managers and locally managed marine areas;\n- guidelines should also be going beyond local objectives, considering the trophic and life traits connectivity and with special attention to future climate and abiotic conditions;\n- contribute to the coordination and capacity building activities of relevant international initiatives and frameworks, in the design and dissemination of actionable knowledge and guidelines to relevant stakeholders; develop training materials, capacity building and empowerment tools, the access to data and scientific expertise to local actors for ecosystems description and the development of ad hoc localised management measures;\n- develop or integrate means and methods (such as sensors, in situ observation devices, remote sensing products developments, citizen science data, etc.) for a cost effective, accessible and lasting monitoring of these functionally associated ecosystems in order to inform on their status, on the effect of measures and to identify necessary management adjustments to changes;\n- support natural capital valuation for cost/benefit analysis of measures of conservation and restoration for coral reefs and associated ecosystems and the services and benefits they provide (food, cultural & social values, nature-based solutions for coastal resilience, protection against extreme events, climate adaptation, etc.) and how they affect fishing, shipping, local tourism or other programmes for sustainability, such as offshore wind.\nProposals should envisage clustering activities with projects funded under this topic as well as with other relevant international or Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 projects working on links between marine biodiversity, functional ecology, ecosystem services, socio-ecological management, cumulated impact of multiple stressors and on observation, mapping, and monitoring for application to the protection and restoration targets. To this end, proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, joint activities, and deliverables.\nProposals should ensure adequate involvement of researchers, Local Communities and Indigenous People, end-users, MPA managers or governance levels relevant to inform, support and implement measures, actors contributing to practical and ready to use knowledge, tools and freely accessible dissemination and capacity building channels.\nProposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora. Proposals should also show how the planned activities could provide timely information for consideration by the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and in particular the IPBES assessment on integrated biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning and ecological connectivity expected to be delivered in late 2027.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts. International cooperation is encouraged.",

These models should include adaptive legislative, governance, education and financing strategies, with potential applications of Generative AI to enhance research;\n- decision makers (e.g. policy makers and public/private strategic decision makers) benefit from synthesised, systematised and prioritised knowledge on models that better integrate values of biodiversity and nature. Including valuation methods for assessing the benefits of restoration measures and the socio-economic distribution of impacts, tools and innovative market and governance instruments (e.g. potential incentives/capacity-building, including possible use of Generative AI-based tools), the application of environmental, social and ethical safeguards, and ensuring that biodiversity is continuously improved (e.g. through the non-deterioration principle) and to enhance community resilience to climate change;\n- decision makers will have at their disposal information, tools, assessment strategies and metrics that allow for the continuous improved protection and restoration of biodiversity, alongside climate resilience, especially through enhanced climate adaptation. These should be integrated into socio-economic analytical frameworks, considering the quantitative and qualitative representation of social and economic variables in the short (up to 1 year), medium and long (5+ years) term, of the implications of applying such frameworks.",
      "scope": "The degradation of natural assets due to human activities, including climate change, emissions to air, water, and soil and land use intensification and change in Europe, and the subsequent cascading effects of biodiversity loss, have profound economic and social implications, including for our standards of living and immaterial aspects of quality of life. Biodiversity loss is increasingly recognised as a risk to macroeconomic and financial stability, affecting key institutions, countries and regions. Protecting and restoring ecosystems not only benefits biodiversity but also contributes to broader socio-economic objectives, such as human health and wellbeing, climate resilience, and particularly climate adaptation.\nTo address these trends, alternative socio-economic models can integrate biodiversity efforts into economic activities. The EU biodiversity strategy, GBF, and SDGs set ambitious biodiversity targets, but achieving them requires overcoming barriers in education, technology, society, economy, and governance. Numerous socio-economic models exist to achieve the necessary ecological, climate, economic, financial and social transition for biodiversity. These models need further analysis and development to be widely accepted and implementable. They play a key role in the transformative change called for by IPBES towards a nature positive society, for example through the deployment of nature-based solutions.\nTo contribute effectively to transformative change, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of the pathways to alternative socio-economic models. This includes better valuing the economic and social benefits that nature protection and restoration bring, beyond monetary valuation, and assessing the cost of inaction. Where possible, the actions should incorporate both quantitative and qualitative research, and the use of Generative AI could integrate new socio-economic data, aiding in model interpretation and action implementation.\nIn particular, actions are expected to:\n- analyse existing models: evaluate and prioritise existing alternative socio-economic models related to biodiversity protection and restoration, identifying best practices and assessing their impacts across Europe. This analysis should explore pathways for future development and implementation of these models, aiming to generate the most positive biodiversity outcomes, while also promoting climate resilience, social equity and community well-being;\n- analyse barriers: Identify and propose solutions to overcome potential barriers and obstacles in scaling up the best available models. This includes considering the potential of Generative AI to enhance model implementation and effectiveness;\n- identify gaps and build capacity: pinpoint gaps in current research, innovation, skills, education, legislation and technology. Propose capacity-building strategies to address these gaps, ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and knowledge are in place to support the widespread adoption of effective and fair socio-economic models;\n- advance valuation methods: Build on previous research, notably incentive mechanisms and natural capital valuation methods (both monetary and non-monetary), to make progress towards standardised, widely accepted indicators. These indicators should reflect broader socio-economic, biodiversity and natural capital benefits as well as trade-offs. A reflexive use of valuation methods is encouraged, considering the ethical and social implications of different valuation approaches;\n- develop and pilot strategies: using collaborative and participatory approaches, develop and pilot strategies, scenario methods, market and non-market measures, instruments, and approaches to scale-up the implementation of alternative socio-economic model.\n- co-design pathways: work with stakeholders, including decision-makers, to co-design pathways towards the implementation of alternative socio-economic models. Develop innovative technologies and tools to support scenarios that capture the specificities of different ecosystems, ensuring that models are adaptable and responsive to the unique challenges faced by various regions and sectors.\n- engage stakeholders: actively involve end-users such as policy and decision makers and citizens in the co-creation process. This could include the use of Generative AI-based tools to fully account for diverse views and needs, facilitating broader acceptance and application of the proposed models.\n- disseminate knowledge: issue and disseminate recommendations, actionable knowledge and empowerment tools at European and possibly Member State levels. Explore synergies with other European initiatives, policies and strategies particularly those under the EU Green Deal, including various fiscal, financial and economic policies to help reach sustainability. Outcomes and findings should also be disseminated beyond the EU.\n- investigate economic models: analyse how traditional economic models contribute to biodiversity loss, climate change and other socio-economic challenges, as well as the interactions between these challenges. Identify pragmatic actions and strategies to address these issues, considering the root causes of unsustainable practises, power imbalances and justice concerns.\nConcretely, the project(s) should support the practical implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy and the GBF, providing evidence-based recommendations. Actions should build on synergies across multiple SDGs to deliver both direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, and leverage the knowledge compiled in IPBES assessment reports [1] . Actions should consider ethical implications throughout project lifecycles, ensuring that outcomes align with broader societal values and contribute to equitable and just transitions. Actions should address specific challenges faced by different ecosystems, especially vulnerable ecosystems (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and communities (e.g. rural areas, those facing socio-economic inequalities).\nProposals should create synergies with other relevant initiatives, particularly Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects, and foresee clustering activities, through the dedication of appropriate resources. Proposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora.\nProposals should involve contributions from the social sciences (including economics, sociology and educational science) and humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] Including the IPBES values assessment, the IPBES scenarios and models assessment, the IPBES nexus assessment and the IPBES transformative change assessment.",

      "scope": "With the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, and more recently the adoption of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the EU has taken strong commitments to address the challenges of the biodiversity crisis, in addition to the current efforts towards increasing resilience to climate change embedded in the EU climate policy. Strong scientific evidence supports the need to act, given the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems for society, economy and resilience.\nHowever, as the debates for the negotiation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation showed, there are different levels of understanding and different approaches towards challenges to be addressed among the EU society, which is increasingly polarised with activists and citizens engaged in nature protection (and more generally environment protection) on the one hand and defenders of the status quo on the other hand. This has even led to local conflicts. While the engagement of activists is visible, little is known about how the rest of society values nature and what citizens think should be done for its protection and restoration.\nR&I activities are expected to:\n- conduct comprehensive research to better understand civil society´s plurality of perceptions and understanding of the biodiversity crisis, its underlying conflicts and links with climate change, identifying key concerns and perspectives. The analysis should identify and quantify the relevance of stakeholder groups and population segments (e.g. based on gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, ethnic and/or cultural origins, etc. and their intersections) sharing similar perceptions and interests. This analysis should build on results of existing research on the relationship between people and nature, including relationship between nature and culture, historical and/or natural heritage, effects of experiences in nature on environmental attitudes and behaviour, etc. and on the report “Methodological assessment regarding the diverse conceptualization of multiple values of nature and its benefits, including biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services” [1] of the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES);\n- address various cases such as stakeholders depending on nature and ecosystems for their professional activities, rural communities living in both protected and not protected areas, urban communities having limited contacts with nature, etc.;\n- analyse the perception of various stakeholders towards the EU commitment to protect and restore ecosystems. In particular, investigate if the need to protect and restore nature is perceived as a top-down approach or if it is understood as a necessity for the benefit of society. Explore solutions to address such issues;\n- drawing on experiences of citizen engagement around the climate transition and biodiversity crisis – such as for instance the Irish Citizen’s Assembly on Biodiversity Loss [2] or local co-creation processes on sustainable transport [3] - pilot citizen engagement (case-studies) around ecosystem protection and restoration possibly with nature-based solutions, with the participation of public authorities who have the competence to implement the results of citizen deliberation, thus creating a pathway to implementation as well as a model for best practice;\n- develop approaches for each identified group to enhance the communication and dissemination of knowledge regarding the biodiversity crisis and its implications, including on climate. These strategies should aim to improve the groups' understanding of the benefits of nature restoration and empower them to make informed decisions.\nA multi-disciplinary approach involving relevant biodiversity expertise should be sought. In addition, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines, including gender studies, and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should involve public authorities with the legal competence to implement policy in biodiversity and nature restoration in their pilots and in their advisory boards.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will collaborate with or build upon the work of R&I projects from any of the following previous calls and projects: The climate imperative and its impact on democratic governance (HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-05), H2020-SC6-GOVERNANCE-2020, the Green Deal Call – cross-cutting theme on empowering citizens, the projects PHOENIX and REAL DEAL under Horizon Europe Missions.\nThe possible participation of the JRC in the project could involve the following contributions from the side of the Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy:\n- supporting networking activities by invitations to JRC events and the Community of Practice of the Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy;\n- capacity building on citizen engagement;\n- offering the use of the JRC Makerspace in Ispra, Italy.\nProposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Latin American and Caribbean countries.\nThe use of AI could be considered for the analyses needed under this topic.\n[1] https://www.ipbes.net/the-values-assessment .\n[2] https://citizensassembly.ie/citizens-assembly-on-biodiversity-loss/ .\n[3] https://mosaic-mission.eu/pilots/gothenburg .",

A successful proposal will contribute to facilitating the implementation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, aligning with the Union’s overarching objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation, for national authorities, by assessing and promoting the most suitable agricultural practices that support agrobiodiversity and a wide range of ecosystem services.\nProjects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- synergies between nature restoration/conservation and food security (production and availability) are scientifically demonstrated to farmers, land managers, advisors and policymakers;\n- suitable measures and strategies, along with evidence-based recommendations, are identified and developed to assist farmers in the implementation phase, while supporting Member States competent authorities in addressing specific targets of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation in agricultural landscapes;\n- collaborations and exchanges between farmers, researchers, and policymakers from competent authorities are strengthened to enable the development of integrated and effective policies that restore natural capital, generate sustainable income for farmers, while also ensuring food availability and quality.",
      "scope": "Farmers play a pivotal role in addressing biodiversity loss while ensuring food production and quality, thereby contributing to overall food security. To support biodiversity-friendly agriculture, it is essential to first list demonstrated farming practices and ecosystems that benefit biodiversity. Next, there is a need to assess the socio-economic impact of nature restoration measures on the agricultural sector and the individual farm, as well as develop and improve existing incentives and their interplay. A key element for a wide adoption of such practices by farmers is demonstrating production and labour benefits, or at least maintaining economic competitiveness in the implementation of nature restoration measures. Moreover, specific targets for agricultural ecosystems outlined in the EU Nature Restoration Regulation necessitate that applied research lays the foundation for Member States to effectively comply and design appropriate and successful strategies. Therefore, environmental, economic, and social benefits, as well as potential trade-offs between nature restoration measures and food security and quality (production and availability) should be demonstrated over different time frames. These should be developed with farmers in mind: short-term and immediate impact on production, their businesses, and nature, as well as medium-, and long-term.\nProposals should:\n- quantify the costs and benefits of restoration measures on farm productivity (referring to the ratio input/output) over short, medium, and long-term. Additionally, evaluate the impact of taking action versus non-action on the provision of ecosystem services, such as climate, water, soil health, pollination, nutrients, natural pest control, erosion prevention, etc., along with their associated economic impact at farm level;\n- develop and assess possible science-based targets for satisfactory levels of restoration for biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems considering Art. 11 of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, a path for implementation by farmers, land managers and policymakers, and further develop, solidify, and harmonise existing indicators of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes;\n- generate evidence to support and improve incentive schemes, including rewarding mechanisms for actions taken and results achieved in nature restoration/conservation on farmland, while considering synergies and trade-offs;\n- assess and compare the potential of various farming approaches to contribute to ecosystem restoration. While considering all types and sizes of farming systems (conventional, organic, agroecological, etc.), prioritise those that are clearly defined to ensure compliance with legislation.\nProposals should adopt a transdisciplinary approach, engaging with relevant experts and stakeholders from farming, biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as from social sciences and humanities (SSH). Proposals must apply the multi-actor approach to ensure adequate involvement of researchers, policymakers, farmers, land managers and agricultural advisors among other relevant stakeholders. Proposals should aim to increase practical, ready to use knowledge and tools, and promote freely accessible dissemination and open capacity building channels.\nProposals should allocate adequate resources to collaborate with topic projects funded under other topics in this work programme, in particular HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-06: Assessing and modelling socio-economic impacts of nature restoration. Moreover, proposals should build on existing knowledge and the results of other relevant projects, as well as ensure cooperation with appropriate Horizon Europe Partnerships, in particular ‘Biodiversa+’ and ‘Agroecology’.\nThe JRC may contribute by advising and providing relevant information on the effects of farming practices on the environment, biodiversity, and climate. This collaboration aims to enhance the targeting and quantification of proposed restoration interventions, alongside fostering cooperation with stakeholders and facilitating the dissemination of results to policymakers.\nProposals should foresee cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the Science Service project BioAgora.",

      "expected_outcome": "In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the common agricultural policy, the EU climate policy and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, a successful proposal will contribute to the expected impact of this destination by supporting the adaptation of agricultural production to the effects of climate change, increasing biodiversity in agroecosystems, and promoting low-input practices, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems and safeguarding food security.\nProjects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- deeper knowledge and characterisation of relevant traits for tolerance and resistance to multiple stresses, whether occurring simultaneously or sequentially, are more accessible to researchers and breeders;\n- the identification of local varieties with high plasticity to cope with multi-stress conditions is enhanced, along with the development of agro-ecological practices that improve stress tolerance while supporting biodiversity-friendly cropping systems;\n- the capacities to evaluate the effects of multiple stresses in crops by researchers and breeders are strengthened;\n- information and recommendations on variety performance and practices to cope with multi-stress are available to advisors and farmers.",
      "scope": "Crop production faces significant challenges due to climate change and the need to adopt low-input practices, including efficient water use, to reduce the environmental impact while ensuring food security. Issues such as salinity, extreme weather conditions like droughts, waterlogging, high temperatures, and emerging patterns of pests and diseases severely impact crops, resulting in reduced productivity and yield losses. Crop responses to multiple stresses differ from their responses to single stresses. Therefore, attention should be given to enhancing crop tolerance to combinations of multiple abiotic and biotic stresses, thus better reflecting real-life agricultural conditions.\nTo address these challenges, it is crucial to evaluate local crop varieties, which are often better adapted to specific environmental conditions and stresses. Identifying local varieties with high plasticity enhances crop resilience and agro-biodiversity. Developing agro-ecological practices to improve stress tolerance will further support these efforts, promoting low-input practices and enhancing the overall adaptability of agricultural systems. Additionally, broad-spectrum strategies for improving stress tolerance in crops should be developed. Smart and future-proof breeding programmes need to systematically consider characteristics that enhance crop resilience and adaptation to these demands.\nProposals should:\n- provide insight into the range of mechanisms and traits that underpin crop responses to multiple stresses, whether occurring simultaneously or sequentially, guiding the development of varieties and a crop system better equipped to withstand abiotic and biotic stresses, including reduced agricultural inputs;\n- increase understanding of the causality between abiotic and biotic stress factors and propose strategies to improve multi-stress tolerance;\n- integrate advanced technologies to assist in evaluating GxExM (Genotype x Environment x Management) interactions in the context of multi-stress, combining multiple \"omics\" data sources, high-throughput phenotyping, computational modelling and artificial intelligence, to evaluate at different levels (e.g. greenhouses, experimental fields, production fields). This integration should assist breeders in developing local varieties optimised for sustainability and climate change adaptation;\n- develop location-specific breeding strategies and agroecological practices, incorporating models and artificial intelligence approaches for prediction of cropping systems output, under multiple stress conditions considering climate change scenarios and climate analogues. These strategies should promote agrobiodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem services;\n- deliver robust methodologies for benchmarking and communicating the performance of crop varieties when they are challenged by multiple stresses.\nProposals should provide a clear explanation and justification for the selected crop(s) in alignment with the proposal’s objectives and the topic’s expected outcomes, considering as well that activities should be carried out in a range of agronomically relevant pedo-climatic conditions. All farming systems and approaches are in scope. If proposals address organic farming, particular attention should be given to aspects related to organic varieties and organic heterogeneous materials.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate tools to evaluate GxExM interactions in the context of multi-stress. A maximum of 20% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted.\nProposals should ensure coherence and complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects, including the agroecology partnership, and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects. Collaboration with European research infrastructures such as AnaEE-ERIC, EMPHASIS or other relevant research infrastructures [1] is encouraged.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/.",

      "scope": "Key elements of circular economy applicable to industrial bio-based processes and technologies include increasing their energy and resource efficiency. In fact, on one side, industrial bio-based systems may be affected by a higher energy consumption; on the other side, energy supplies may experience shortage and/or price fluctuations that make the most energy-intensive sectors more vulnerable. Industrial bio-based systems within the scope of this topic do not include food/feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural/recreation sectors.\nProposals should select one or more case-studies of bio-based industrial systems, within the scope of the topic, in the EU and Associated Countries and:\n- describe how to improve energy efficiency, developing and implementing, for example: energy efficient (thermal) separation technologies (e.g., membrane distillation); fast and energy efficient drying processes of biomass (e.g., for wood residues, algae residues, and other residual streams); optimized catalysts, enzymatic processes and reactors to save energy, etc.. analyse the rebound effect of energy saving measures and how to address them;\n- analyse the nexus water-energy in the processes of the selected bio-based industrial systems and how the reduction of water consumption contributes to energy saving, e.g., in separation and purification processes, as well as how to address the water-energy integration within the factory by considering the whole processes and all the utilities;\n- describe how to enable energy consumption flexibility through the optimization of processes with faster response rate to be flexible to variable energy supply, (e.g., by slowing production when less energy available, and prices are high, or increasing the production and/or storing energy and energy carriers onsite when surplus of energy is available, and prices are low);\n- analyse the implementation of renewable energy use in the selected bio-based industrial systems, including shifting from fossil-based to renewable resources and/or shifting to electrification;\n- include a task in the project to demonstrate the solutions analysed under the previous four bullet points, to i) improve energy efficiency; ii) integrate water-energy nexus; iii) enable energy consumption flexibility; iv) use renewable energy. Such solutions should be demonstrated on one or more of the selected case-studies, and should be optimized, also through the applications of digital tools including based on artificial intelligence. Assess the contribution to climate neutrality of the selected solutions.\nFor increased resource efficiency (water and energy use) and circular economy (e.g. minimisation of waste generation or raw materials use) in large industrial installations, please refer to the Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/).\nThe multi-actor approach is encouraged.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.",

      "scope": "The green transition and moving to a circular economy will require changes not only in the way materials are used and products are designed, but also in the way companies operate and business models are set up. The majority of current business models and the global economic and trading system are based on linear and unsustainable use of materials and products. This results in ever-increasing consumption, depletion of resources, increase in CO2 emissions and environmental deterioration, and undesirable generation of waste. The transition to a sustainable and competitive and circular economy necessitates transformative changes in material usage and corporate operations, with innovative business models able to trigger sustainable consumer behaviours and purchasing preferences. These models are pivotal in steering both industries and consumers towards sustainable practices, aligning with the comprehensive environmental objectives of the European Green Deal and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030. The transition to a circular economy is key to reducing pressures on natural resources. It is also a prerequisite to achieve the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss.\nNovel circular business models can affect business-internal practices as well as interactions with other businesses or civil society. Proposals should develop and demonstrate at large scale innovative business models to facilitate product reliability/durability, reusability, reparability, refurbishment, repurpose and remanufacture, including the preparation stage, as well as product-as-a-service business models.\nProposals should assess and quantify, including monetisation, when possible, the environmental, social and economic impacts of these novel business models on relevant stakeholders, i.e., consumers, social partners, private companies with a focus on SMEs, municipalities and regions. The assessment of environmental impacts should be done from a lifecycle perspective and build on rules set in the Environmental Footprint methods wherever possible. Impacts of the business models on the overall resource efficiency and material use should also be assessed, as far as possible. Proposals should analyse the ‘pull’ factors that shift consumer choices in the direction of products/services offered by circular business models, as well as what can encourage more to do so. Ecodesign requirements laid down in the ESPR and EU Ecolabel aspects, and the verification of green claims should be considered where relevant.\nProposals should contribute to the development of innovative business models, including social economy entities and social enterprises, to enable the transition towards a circular and sustainable ecosystem and to stimulate the uptake of sustainable consumption patterns. Proposals should address the opportunities of developing new business models in the context of the circular economy R-strategies (refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, repurpose, remanufacture) as well as upgrade and product-as-a-service business models.\nProposals should include social innovation and explore understanding behaviours to identify routes towards an increase of demand for sustainable products and even towards an overall reduction of consumption and product/materials use, which includes products as a service. Proposals should also explore self-sufficiency approaches and promote regenerative practices aimed at restoring biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and strengthening local communities and social justice.\nThe proposals should address the different perspectives of all relevant actors in a proposed project, which could be actors involved in raw material sourcing, material processing and manufacturing, intermediate production, end-product manufacturing, as well as brand owners, retailers, enterprises, re-use and repair organisations, civil society/consumers, etc. Proposals should also reflect on how access to finance can be facilitated and how economic viability can be ensured, and how governance can promote the establishment of these new business models. Critical issues of change management, scaling and diffusion of solutions should be addressed.\nProposals should target specific social groups and their purchasing power while developing novel business models, in order to keep a fair transition to climate neutrality in mind. This includes possible questions of gender equality, diversity and inclusion. Also, proposals should assess the potential of and prerequisites for new job opportunities in the areas of reuse, preparing for reuse, repair, upgrade, refurbishment, repurpose and remanufacture, contributing qualitative and quantitative data to the reskilling programmes of the green transition.\nFor the development of novel business models, projects should include elements of fair and affordable pricing of services/labour within various R-strategies as well as upgrade and products-as-a-service models. In this context, projects should also analyse barriers to such models and possible regulatory, governance and economic solutions. Projects should also address possible unintended or rebound effects, both positive and negative, particularly for consumers and the environment, of such novel business models.\nProposals should explore the territorial and geographical dimensions of the establishment and success of new business models and aim at synergies with the New European Bauhaus and the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Projects are strongly encouraged to organise joint activities, ensure synergies and undertake clustering activities with CCRI projects and the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. To avoid double-funding and to create added value, projects should seek synergies with projects to be performed under the LIFE-2024-SAP-ENV Call [1] .\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/life/wp-call/2021-2024/call-fiche_life-2024-sap-env_en.pdf",

      "scope": "Under this open topic, proposals should address common but also new, upcoming, or unforeseen challenges to the green transition of SMEs through innovative, disruptive and sustainable solutions. Proposals should identify and analyse key barriers for the sustainable and circular transition of SMEs and develop and demonstrate innovative solutions. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls ‘Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors’ 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nSolutions can be innovative products, processes, services, or also plans and arrangements. These solutions can include but are not limited to the following examples: new business models (e.g. regenerative), collaborative governance and organisational approaches, development of tailored transformation plans, the identification, development and communication of meaningful set of metrics and indicators, environmental management and reporting tools or others. Proposals can also include the use of digital solutions e.g. digital product passports (DPP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) or digital assistants enabled by Generative Artificial Intelligence. Proposals should analyse the required skills and include skill development activities for current and future employees of the SMEs.\nProposals should demonstrate the feasibility (e.g. economic, technical), environmental performance and utility and transferability of the developed and demonstrated solutions, notably to address climate change mitigation, biodiversity or environmental remediation aspects related to the sustainable and circular transformation of SMEs. The demonstrations of the innovative solutions should be done in a large-scale operational environment with strong involvement of SMEs. The first deployment of the solutions and the validation of their utility can be demonstrated at territorial, sectoral or value chain context. Nevertheless, the solution should be transferable, and the proposal should include the effectively replication in other contexts.\nSuccessful proposals should address the requirements of EU policies relevant to the green transformation of SMEs, if suitable also national or regional strategies, and consider demands from business partners, as customers, to advance their related commitments. Proposed solutions should be concrete and user-friendly to lower the administrative burden for SMEs. This includes adopted, and planned legislation such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), Green Claims Directive, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), EU taxonomy, best available techniques standards and technology developments like digital product passports (DPP). Proposals should also include the development of policy recommendations that support the widespread adoption of the validated solution and use of new knowledge in the development and revision of regulatory frameworks.\nSuccessful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as collaborate with existing public organisations, e.g. the Enterprise Europe Network, Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) or the EU pact for skills initiative. It is expected that SMEs or SME associations are participating in the consortia, to ensure applicability and dissemination of the results. The engagement of non-governmental organisations, small-scale initiatives and suitable industry or industry associations is encouraged.",

They will contribute to the expected impacts of this Destination, notably to innovative business and governance models that foster safe and sustainable product design.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- material and product manufacturers apply the ecodesign principles in developing and manufacturing products and are equipped with methods to assess the performance and potential compliance of their products with the ecodesign requirements to be developed under ESPR, as well to drive sustainability innovations;\n- market surveillance authorities and notified bodies are equipped with methods for the verification of compliance of products with the ecodesign requirements;\n- consumers have access to reliable and verified information about the ecodesign performance of products;\n- consumers benefit from more sustainable and circular products, i.e. durable, reliable, reparable, reusable, upgradable, recyclable products including increased recycled content.",
      "scope": "The Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products (ESPR) [1] lays down requirements for products placed on the EU market to improve their environmental sustainability. First, the Commission adopts a working plan prioritising product groups, based on the prioritisation criteria laid down in the text of the regulation. Second, the Commission will develop targeted performance and information requirements known as ‘ecodesign requirements’ for prioritized products. This will be done on a product-specific basis or horizontally (for several product groups with similar technical characteristics which would allow requirements to be defined horizontally) through “preparatory studies”. The ecodesign requirements will need to address the environmental impacts of the product(s) in question in a meaningful way, making reference to the methodologies prescribed in the ESPR. The projects are expected to generate knowledge and data which will serve as a scientific basis for and feed into the consequent “preparatory studies”.\nEach applicant should choose at least one of the following product groups [2] : detergents, paints, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, home/interior textiles, footwear or toys. For the analysed product groups, proposals should include in the scope representative sub-categories of the product groups on the EU market making reference to relevant European, international and national classification systems and standards, where existing.\nProjects are expected to:\n- assess how product parameters (as per Annex I of the ESPR) relevant for circularity can be determined for the given product group and explore potential new parameters with the aim of improving the circularity performance of the product;\n- assess the performance of products in relation to the specific product parameters (following or building on the methods used in ESPR) and explore pathways to their improvement;\n- focus on those product parameters having impact on product aspects contributing to circularity, i.e., durability, reliability, reusability, upgradability, reparability, possibility of maintenance and refurbishment, presence of substances of concern, resource use and resource efficiency, recycled content, possibility of remanufacturing and recycling, possibility of recovery of materials, expected generation of waste materials, and premature obsolescence, as well as social sustainability requirements, which are currently not covered by ESPR;\n- develop, test and validate product-specific testing methods for the determination and verification of product performance in relation to the said specific parameters;\n- provide analyses and recommendations for additional mechanisms and incentives to reward design for circularity and product durability – such as extended guarantees, VAT reduction, and others – and which best mitigate potential trade-offs;\n- map the material flows relevant for the given product group and assess the impacts of potential requirements on these flows within and across value chains (requirement on e.g. recycled content in one value chain can impact availability of secondary raw material in another value chain, etc.);\n- develop quantitative and qualitative data on relevant aspects of consumer behaviour in relation to the product parameters for the given product groups.\nProposals should take into account all provisions of the ESPR. The ESPR provisions aim at improving the overall sustainability of the product(s) in question, and by improving the product aspects set out in that regulation (see Art. 5; Annex I). In addition, the revised version of the MEErP methodology by JRC [3] , and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation: Study on new product priorities [4] published in 2024 should all be reference points. The series of standards on material efficiency for energy-related products EN455XX must be considered as well. In relation to the presence of substances of concern, building on the relevant provisions in the ESPR, the proposals should take into account the principles of Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) [5] applied to chemicals and materials.\nFor the individual products within the product groups, the proposals should assess the existing methods for the setting of the ecodesign requirements in relation to the specific parameters (as set out in Annex I of the ESPR) with the objective to improve the product aspects (as set out in Article 5 of the ESPR) and, as appropriate, develop them further based on the nature of the product, its most relevant aspects and its impacts over its life cycle. In doing so, the projects should make use of the work already done in assessing the setting of requirements under Directive 2009/125/EC and the continuing efforts to develop and improve science-based assessment tools, such as the updated Methodology for Ecodesign of Energy-related Products (MEErP).\nAlso, proposals should take into account: relevant technical information in particular of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 on the EU Ecolabel, Directive 2010/75/EU on Industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control), technical screening criteria adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, the “do no significant harm” principles and green public procurement criteria.\nThe development of a product specific testing method should include not only the development of the method from the theoretical point of view, but also its proper testing and validation to evaluate its suitability, repeatability, and reproducibility in practice. Projects should demonstrate advances in the development and/or application of related digital/AI computational tools, methods or technologies in the area of assessing ecodesign requirements and developing methods for the verification of performance and involve relevant Member States Authorities responsible for enforcement.\nAs part of the project, proposals should address the knowledge gap in capacity and skills, especially for SMEs, potentially limiting the understanding of upcoming ecodesign requirements especially if trickling down from upstream in their product value chains as well as when conducting the assessments of compliance with ecodesign requirements. Learning and training materials should be developed for dissemination and training purposes within the relevant companies and value chains.\nSuccessful proposals are encouraged to cooperate with the JRC to foster coordination with on-going JRC science for policy activities to foster the implementation of the European Sustainable Product Regulation.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 of 13 June 2024 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, amending Directive (EU) 2020/1828 and Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC, text here .\n[2] Products and product groups which have been prioritized by JRC in the study Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation: Study on new product priorities https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/2024-12/JRC138903_01.pdf\n[3] Review of the MEErP - Publications Office of the EU (europa.eu)\n[4] Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation: Study on new product priorities https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/2024-12/JRC138903_01.pdf\n[5] JRC Publications Repository - Safe and Sustainable by Design chemicals and materials - Methodological Guidance (europa.eu)",

      "scope": "The circular economy action plan (CEAP) aims to stimulate the development of sustainable products, in the EU and beyond, contributing to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss. To achieve this, it establishes a sustainable product policy regulation that broadens the scope of the Ecodesign Directive both in terms of products (covering a very broad range of products, beyond energy-related products only) and new kinds of requirements. It will be key to achieve a sustainable, resilient and competitive circular economy.\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a key source of information on environmental impacts of products, services or systems. The Commission proposed the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) [1] as a common way of measuring environmental performance. The PEF methodology, grounded on the LCA standard methodology, allows manufacturers and consumers to obtain reliable and comparable information about the performance of products with respect to various environmental impact categories. A calculation based on the general PEF methods gives quantitative information on the impacts of products, taking into consideration the entire value chain.\nR&I activities in the proposal should:\n- review existing knowledge on LCA/PEF, identify and fill knowledge gaps and then develop and test PEF category rules for selected product groups of policy and market relevance;\n- assess the added value and cost-benefit of these rules compared to other methods or criteria;\n- perform in-depth full life cycle assessment studies (also addressing end-of-life aspects) based on PEF for those products groups to identify, quantify, interpret and communicate environmental impacts;\n- develop appropriate datasets tailored to the assessed product groups identifying and filling data gaps, as much as possible based on industry and other representative data, and create tools which will be made publicly available to enable and ease PEF-compliant assessments and communications among stakeholders, as well as their verification;\n- develop and apply approaches and methods to derive and support potential ecodesign requirements [2] from PEF-compliant assessments, i.e. how decisions for design with a lower environmental footprint can be motivated, and further assess their socio-economic impacts;\n- develop and apply approaches and methods: a) to identify and check sustainability requirements used or proposed in legislation, labels and standards relevant for the products in study; b) to analyse how to enhance consistency, synergies and harmonisation between such requirements and ecodesign requirements;\n- develop guidance, training and dissemination strategies and material to support the wider use of PEF in the selected sector(s).\nProposals should focus on at least one of the following product groups: home/interior textiles; final products made of metals, or plastics; detergents; lubricants, paints and varnishes; polymers; selected groups of other chemicals; ICT products.\nFor the analysed product groups, proposals should target a sufficiently broad and granular scope, targeting comprehensive representative sub-categories and products on the market. In doing that, proposals should refer to relevant European, international, and national classification systems and standards where possible. Projects should adhere to the most recent EU rules and data [2] established for the PEF methods and bring together all relevant expert groups and different stakeholders active along the value chains of the selected product groups (industry members, researchers, SMEs and NGOs).\nProposals should develop appropriate and comparable datasets for assessing the analysed products as well as tools and digital solutions to facilitate the sharing and processing of information along the value chain as well as the assessment, communication and verification of environmental characteristics of products based on the PEF method.\nAs part of the project, proposals should also address the knowledge gap in capacity and skills, especially for SMEs, potentially limiting the understanding, conducting and implementing of PEF-based assessments. Learning and training materials should be developed for dissemination and training purposes within and across companies and value chains.\nThe data produced in this topic should be open access in line with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). Furthermore, different tasks, outputs, interactions with stakeholders, and communication, dissemination and exploitation activities should be conceived in a logical sequence along the lifetime of the project.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021H2279 ; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401781 .

They will contribute to the expected impacts of this Destination, notably improving the durability, reliability, reusability, repairability, recyclability and circularity of consumer products.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- demonstrated innovative solutions for large scale uptake and implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, providing for their application by producers, producer organisations and relevant actors across the EU and Associated Countries, including cross-border cooperation.\n- improved knowledge of economic operators (including SMEs) and consumers regarding EPR schemes and eco-modulation of EPR fees, and how these contribute to increasing circularity, minimising the demand for primary resources, reducing GHG emissions, preventing environmental pollution and reducing the pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- optimal functioning and increased uptake of EPR schemes in specific priority product value chains within the EU and Associated Countries, i.e.: construction products, ICT products, furniture, mattresses, and carpets.",
      "scope": "The 2020 circular economy action plan introduces measures that aim at making sustainable products the norm, contributing to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss. It focuses on resource-intensive sectors with the highest circularity potential such as textiles, plastics, packaging, electronics including ICT products, furniture and construction products.\nEPR schemes can contribute to improve circularity gaps in key product value chains with high circularity potential, given its full lifecycle approach. They make producers responsible for the entire lifecycle of the products made available on the market, from the design-phase up to their end of life, including waste collection and recycling. These schemes can be a lever for producers, including SMEs, to design their products for circularity considering sustainability criteria and have been proven successful in improving the management of waste in products such as packaging and batteries.\nR&I activities in proposals should:\n- develop, test and demonstrate operational solutions for large scale implementation of EPR schemes that consider the eco-modulation of EPR fees for one or more of the following product value chains: construction products, ICT products, furniture, mattresses, and carpets;\n- develop and test novel circular business models and solutions linked to EPR schemes for the above-mentioned product value chains, supported by ecodesign requirements [1] ;\n- assess the economic, environmental and social cost-benefits of the implementation of EPR schemes for the relevant stakeholders, especially for consumer and producers (with a focus on SMEs);\n- develop and test the application of dedicated digital technologies, such as the digital product passport (pre-consumer) and tracking applications (post-consumer), to collect evidence within those product value chains and facilitate producers’ registration and the exchange of information between national EPR schemes;\n- provide policy recommendations for specific elements of an EPR scheme that incentivises waste prevention and/or minimisation (e.g., ecodesign, reuse, preparation for reuse, repair and refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling) and facilitate cross-border cooperation.\nProposals should consider the global perspective within the national EPR schemes, as frequently the value chains mentioned above are established at a global scale and producers may be situated outside of the EU. This may apply to new products made available on the EU-market or waste from post-consumer products managed outside the EU. They should also include the case of online platforms, given the increase of online sales and the associated potential risks of free-riding economic operators, as well as cross-border cooperation mechanisms.\nProjects should bring together all relevant stakeholders active in the selected product value chains (industry members, local authorities, waste management operators, SMEs, economic operators, producer responsible organisations (PROs), consumer organisations, researchers, and NGOs).\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines, namely economics and sociology, and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThe JRC may provide expertise in circular economy policy and foster coordination with on-going related activities and participate, potentially, in the projects Scientific Advisory Board.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401781",

Consumer empowerment encourages sustainable choices, which in return contribute to pollution reduction and climate neutrality.\nProposals should address the gaps in public awareness about the environmental impacts of the mainstream consumption patterns and between prevalent consumer knowledge/awareness and actual behaviour. Proposals should make use of social innovation and should analyse and identify the economic, social, behavioural, psychological, technical and legal barriers and levers for the uptake of circular and sustainable products, solutions and services. The analysis should address relevant aspects of fairness, equality, diversity, inclusion, and gender.\nProposals should first assess the patterns and underlying motivations of consumption habits through experimentation within various cultural, geographical, social, demographic, and economic groups. Based on this assessment, projects should draw and evaluate possible pathways to behavioural change of various economic actors (municipalities, companies including retailers and service providers, end-users) to enable the transition to circular and sustainable economy. These pathways should show how to change the demand for products and services with high environmental impacts and resource intensity, towards more circular and sustainable ones, including used and second-hand products, sharing services, repairability and durability. Possible environmental impacts in this context should be seen from a lifecycle perspective, including and valuing in monetary terms environmental externalities and building on rules set in Environmental Footprint methods wherever possible. The pathways should include policy, governance and business recommendations in all relevant areas (economic, behavioural, educational, technical, legal, cultural, etc.).\nPower imbalances between industry and civil society should be addressed, and the impact and potential of Ecodesign, Ecolabel, green claims, and of digital infrastructures and Digital Product Passports should be explored with a view to changing vantage points and consumer behaviour.\nConvincing narratives, framing strategies and storytelling tactics should be developed, improving knowledge of selling points, i.e., which features and qualities make a product or service attractive for consumers.\nProposals should explore the territorial and geographical dimensions of consumption patterns, and aim at synergies with the New European Bauhaus and the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Proposals are strongly encouraged to organise joint activities, ensure synergies and undertake clustering activities with CCRI projects and the CCRI CSO.\nFor this topic, the engagement of citizens and civil society in the project activities is central to achieving the targeted outcomes. This topic also requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as ESS ERIC or other relevant research infrastructures [1] .\nThe JRC may provide expertise in circular economy policy and foster coordination with on-going related activities and participate, potentially, in the projects Scientific Advisory Board.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

      "scope": "The EU circular economy monitoring framework has been developed to monitor the progress of the EU and Member States in the circular economy transition. It uses aggregated macroeconomic indicators suitable for understanding how the whole economy changes. At the microeconomic level, i.e. , at the level of individual economic agents such as companies, households or investors, or at the level of small territorial units such as cities or regions, no formal monitoring system exists besides the criteria set under the Taxonomy Regulation for Sustainable Activities that are set at activity level. However, more and more economic agents start to use CE indicators either for their internal decisions or for communication with their business partners, clients or the public. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and the European Environment Agency 11 are currently doing research into circularity indicators in specific areas. The European Commission also launched a stocktaking exercise in the form of a contract for the development and testing of indicators and methods for measuring transition to climate-neutral circularity, its benefits, challenges and trade-offs under the Horizon Europe work programme for 2021.\nA number of different indicators are currently used for this purpose, often with low information value or outright erroneous and misleading. Several organisations attempted to develop more robust indicator systems and offer them to their members or clients. While this effort is useful, none of these organisations has the authority to propose a monitoring system that would be accepted by a majority of economic actors and stop the proliferation of micro-level CE indicators. The European Commission is in the unique position to convene relevant stakeholders and facilitate the process of development of harmonised CE micro-economic monitoring indicators. Financial institutions are turning to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to organise a similar process to harmonise the monitoring indicators suitable for financial institutions.\nProjects should develop and test a set or several sets of simple and meaningful indicators for monitoring of progress towards circular economy at the level of individual economic agents, i.e., in cities and regions, in households, or at different company levels. These indicators should allow circularity monitoring for the addressed entities, but also help public administration and financial institutions in their decision-finding in support of circularity transition measures. Proposals should test the operability of these indicators in the public/private investor environment, or in municipal/regional governance.\nIf within a project several separate sets of indicators are developed for different users, these should be compatible and possibly have a common set of core indicators.\nProposals should also thematise reasons for and benefits from the use of these circularity indicators and present convincing arguments. Proposals should take a lifecycle perspective and consider available instruments such as the consumption footprint indicator.\nProject results will be of relevance for the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Projects are therefore strongly encouraged to organise joint activities, ensure synergies and undertake clustering activities with CCRI projects and the CCRI CSO.\nThe JRC may provide expertise in circular economy policy and foster coordination with on-going related activities and participate, potentially, in the projects Scientific Advisory Board.",

      "scope": "Proposals are expected to implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions for the deployment and upscaling of the circular economy in cities and regions. The main objective is to stimulate social innovation through new circular innovative technologies, novel governance and business models in order to contribute to climate mitigation and help reduce pressures on natural resources, whilst increasing Europe’s competitiveness.\nThis CCRI-related topic does not target specific technologies or industrial sectors, but supports the implementation of a systemic approach. This means that the implemented circular systemic solutions should involve relevant circular economy stakeholders in the targeted cities/regions, and address several (at least two) sectors and value chains – as set out in the 2020 circular economy action plan [1] .\nProposals should select their circular systemic solutions and related economic sectors (e.g. construction and buildings, transport and mobility, bioeconomy, land use and spatial planning) based on a detailed analysis of the cities’ and regions’ socio-economic and environmental needs, as well as their local circular potentials.\nProposals should monitor and evaluate the implementation and the impacts of their circular systemic solutions through the project lifespan. This should include the identification, analysis, and when feasible, quantification of the economic, social and environmental benefits and other results. By doing so, proposals could take into consideration various social variables (e.g. gender, age, socio-economic status). In this case, proposals should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.\nProposals should facilitate knowledge and experience transfer for further outreach and replication across EU Member States and Associated Countries. They should therefore clearly identify the lessons learned from the demonstration projects, specifying the enabling framework, the main (regulatory and/or market) barriers and the enablers, the business case as well as any other relevant factors for successful replication and upscaling in other cities and/or regions. In that respect, proposals should include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results to ‘replicators’. This is essential for ensuring that circular systemic solutions demonstrated in specific areas are replicated in others, and where feasible, at larger scale.\nProposals should define financing strategies for their circular systemic solutions as part of their exploitation plan. Proposals should also foresee financing follow-up, for instance by linking with the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative financial advisory services (including the Horizon Europe funded Project Development Assistance Projects [2] and the European Investment Bank’s Circular City Centre [3] ).\nSelected proposals will support the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI).\nThis topic targets public local and regional authorities or their groupings in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Proposals should support the inclusive engagement and active participation of all relevant circular economy stakeholders in the targeted cities and regions, such as policymakers (at all governance levels), research bodies and academia, the civil society, the private sector (industry, entrepreneurs, start-ups, small and medium enterprises etc.), social economy entities and financial intermediaries. Moreover, proposals should ideally consider different typologies (urban/peri-urban/rural), sizes (towns/cities) and/or geographical areas. Multi-actor Approach (MAA) and social innovation are encouraged.\nProposals should clearly specify how they will ensure synergies and complementarities with other relevant circular economy projects and initiatives, including those recognised as CCRI Projects [4] and CCRI Associated Partners [5] . In that sense, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the CCRI office, projects and partners.\nIn particular, proposals are expected to organise joint activities and undertake clustering activities (e.g. thematic working groups, joint events, joint R&I gap analysis and policy briefs) with CCRI projects sharing a common theme and/or addressing similar issues. The proposals are also expected to ensure that their dissemination plan includes dedicated (possibly joint) actions for promotion of their results and lessons learned on the official CCRI website [6] of the European Commission and through other CCRI-related channels. Both clustering and dissemination activities will be facilitated and supported by the CCRI Coordination and Support Office [7] and aim to ease knowledge exchange, foster solution replication and up-taking as well as maximise impact.\nLinkages with relevant initiatives such as the Hubs for Circularity [8] , the Regional Innovation Valleys [9] , the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored – whenever relevant.\n[1] The CEAP focuses on the sectors and value chains that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high such as: electronics and ICT, batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients.\n[2] https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects?f%5B0%5D=type_of_action%3A183\n[3] https://advisory.eib.org/about/circular-city-centre.htm\n[4] List of CCRI Projects from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects .\n[5] List of CCRI Associated Partners: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/associated-partners .\n[6] Official CCRI website: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/\n[7] About – CCRI office | Circular Cities and Regions Initiative .\n[8] Hubs4Circularity (h4c-community.eu) .\n[9] Selected Regional Innovation Valleys | Research and Innovation .",

      "scope": "The action covers modern biodiscovery approaches, including full integration of digital-driven, ‘-omics’ and associated bioinformatic tools [1] , which make possible the identification and further upscaling (optimized production) of bioactive natural compounds with potential high-value application in various bio-based sectors including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, food/feed additives, agrochemicals, cleaning etc. In the context of this topic, the natural products are understood as biologically active products such as secondary metabolites as well as enzymes derived from terrestrial organisms. New products should be safe and sustainable following the SSbD approach. [2]\nThe scope covers immense diversity of terrestrial micro- and macro-organisms and their communities, which represents a rich and largely unexplored reservoir of natural products and their base ingredients (e.g. plants, fungi, microorganisms etc are in scope. The biochemical interplay between interspecies communities, e.g. symbiotic or defence mechanisms may offer attractive leads and is also in scope). For the coverage of aquatic bioprospecting see parallel topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-14: Bioprospecting of marine natural products in the -omics & artificial intelligence era.\nThe aim of this action is to broaden the range of novel compounds, lowering the production costs, quicken the development pipeline, and enable more innovation for the industrial operators, with clear-cut benefits for the final users (consumers and industries). The biodiscovery pipeline may cover in silico prospecting, genomic characterisation, creation of natural product libraries, bioactivity screening, chemical structure elucidation, natural products isolation and purification, and/or optimized production pathways via biotechnology and biomanufacturing approaches (including via gene editing) in suitable industrial facilities (bioreactors/biorefineries, e.g. microbial production), or synthetic biology approaches.\nTargeted terrestrial biological resources can be sourced from their natural environment (in-situ) and/or from public and private collections and gene-banks (ex-situ).\nThe integration of digital approaches and tools (AI, computer algorithms such as machine learning, modelling, data science, digital twins etc) on optimizing the biodiscovery processes such as identification of biosynthetic gene clusters and metabolic pathways, enzyme selection, combinatorial assembly and annotation of high-throughput DNA sequencing data, bioactivity prediction, elucidation of the structure of compounds, experimental design etc is in scope (see the parallel topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-09: Unleashing the potential and advancing the impact of the digitalization/AI of the bio-based value chains).\nSafety to the end-users, and operators needs to be assessed and guaranteed.\nThe action needs to avoid overlaps to past or ongoing topics (e.g. projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CIRCBIO-02-05-two-stage - Life sciences and their convergence with digital technologies for prospecting, understanding and sustainably using biological resources, or the topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01 - Broadening the spectrum of robust enzymes and microbial hosts in industrial biotechnology), consider synergies to parallel actions (e.g. HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-14 - Bioprospecting of marine natural products in the omics and artificial intelligence era), as well as funded under topic HORIZON-2020-FNR-11-2020: Prospecting aquatic and terrestrial natural biological resources for biologically active compounds [3] . Also, links to the actions under the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU) may be established, as relevant.\nProposals should take into account the findings of the Global Resources Outlook 2024 of the International Resource Panel.\nProjects will have a strong industry/SME focus and include demonstration activities to proof the techno/economic viability of the production of the proposed terrestrial natural product(s) and/or the biodiscovery platform tools combining digital approaches and tools and biotechnologies.\nThe action needs to guarantee biodiversity preservation. This can be addressed, inter alia, by covering propagation of biological material, including by in vitro cultivation, as well as by biotechnological approaches. The aim is to decrease of pressure on wild resources and ensure higher overall sustainability, with policy dialogue with competent authorities; projects need to comply with applicable EU regulations and international rules on access to biological resources, such as UN Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol, their sustainable use and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from their utilisation. A sustainability assessment should be carried out to evaluate the environmental, economic and social performance of the developed product(s). Proposals should contribute to understanding of potential trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of ecosystems, and their potential to deliver ecosystem services. Any risks to the ecosystems should be assessed and minimised, along the application of the Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) principle.\nProposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded under this topic and with similar recent or ongoing projects.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, for win-win outcomes and mutual benefits.\n[1] Related to e.g. statistics, algorithms, AI, data science, modelling etc.\n[2] Commission Recommendation (EU) 2022/2510 of 8 December 2022 establishing a European assessment framework for ‘safe and sustainable by design’ chemicals and materials.\n[3] https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_FNR-11-2020/en .",

      "scope": "There is an unprecedented amount of data available in the bio-based sector today, among others, from the ever-growing ‘-omics’ technologies and integration of sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Big data and analytics solutions allow bio-based actors, in particular, the bio-based industry, but also other R&I and civil society stakeholders, to tap into this wealth of data to drive innovation and sustainability. Operators already use the bioinformatics solutions but there is still much potential to explore undiscovered bio-based systems , improve processes and develop cleaner solutions (e.g. see parallel topics HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-14: Bioprospecting of marine natural products in the omics & artificial intelligence era, and HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-08: Bioprospecting and optimized production of the terrestrial natural products: new opportunities for bio-based sectors).\nAI enables also the bio-based operators to automate a wide range of processes, helping them scale up their operations. Using AI image analysis or leveraging deep learning can be used to analyse microbiomes, screen phenotypes, and develop rapid diagnostics in a vast range of applications. Use of AI to predict best metabolic pathways for biosynthesis, optimize/engineer enzymatic activities, and virtually test several variables can speed up bioprocesses’ development, while helping to reduce costs and deliver novel molecules for the market. Also, streamlining biorefineries with AI can led to several levels of productivity gains. Moreover, systemic and integrated modelling approaches can optimise the rational deployment of bio-based value chains.\nThe action will first, explore the potential of AI and other digital technologies and tools in the bio-based sector and, next, focus on developing new capacities, high-quality tools and algorithms of AI and other digital technologies and tools to be demonstrated for the most promising (in terms of impact on environmental sustainability and competitiveness) applications of this sector. In this context, the concept of a ‘digital twin’ [1] could be explored. Generative artificial intelligence is in scope, if relevant to the proposed concept.\nIn line with the current definition of the EU bioeconomy strategy, health biotechnology sector is not in scope.\nThe scope covers all relevant aspects of the contribution of AI/digital methodologies and tools capable of delivering the high sustainability gains (resource efficiency, circularity, climate neutrality etc), as well as enhance the European industrial competitiveness (in particular in regard to improved quality of bio-based products, strategic autonomy, resilience and role of innovative SMEs). The proposals should demonstrate the upscaling from the current potential, align it to parallel actions on AI and other digital technologies and tools (e.g. database development, predictive capacities, EU-level initiatives (e.g. EU AI Act, Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative), and incorporate the systematic assessment of the risks and opportunities for the sector.\nMulti-actor Approach (MAA) and social innovation are encouraged, especially to address the societal concerns and perceptions on the role of AI in the bio-based innovation and broader bioeconomy (e.g., impacts on skills and job opportunities/risks). All relevant stakeholders and value chain actors are in scope. Links to the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU) operations are strongly encouraged. Proposals should also consider citizens engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and support, and encourage social innovation approaches.\nProposals should take into account the findings of the Global Resources Outlook 2024 of the International Resource Panel. Any risks to the ecosystems should be assessed and minimised, along the application of the Do-No-Significant-Harm (DNSH) principle.\nThe action will serve to develop guidelines for the policy makers, industry and civil society, in an inclusive co-creation process.\nProposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded under this topic and with similar recent or ongoing projects.\nProposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as IBISBA or other relevant research infrastructures [2] .\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, e.g. with countries mentioned in the EU biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative communication, such as United States of America, Japan, South Korea, and India, for win-win outcomes and mutual benefits.\n[1] A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical object, person, or process, contextualized in a digital version of its environment. Digital twins can help an organization simulate real situations and their outcomes, ultimately allowing it to make better decisions.\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

This will focus on sharing best practice and inclusive participation across the EU and society;\n- improved awareness on the level of EU, national and regional policy making, based on scientific excellence and inclusive co-creation process with relevant stakeholders;\n- development of an EU vision and strategic research and innovation agenda to foster biotechnology and biomanufacturing solutions to address EU economic security risks and global challenges like climate change or biodiversity protection.",
      "scope": "The action will first take stock of the large number of funded actions on biotechnology and biomanufacturing (EU – including European Partnerships (in particular, under Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU)), EU Missions, and European research infrastructures programmes in the area of biotechnology such as EU-IBISBA, as well as others on the national, regional, and international level), related to industrial, environmental, marine and agri-food biotechnology (note: in line with the current definition of the EU bioeconomy strategy, health biotechnology is not in scope), as well as parallel broader scientific advances on the same topics.\nAreas of interest could cover CRISPR-Cas gene editing, synthetic biology, digital technologies, including as advanced under the EU-funded projects, e.g. project GENEBECON, funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-08: New genomic techniques (NGT): understanding benefits and risks – focus on bio-based innovation, projects DETECTIVE and DARWIN, under topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-11: New detection methods on products derived from new genomic techniques for traceability, transparency and innovation in the food system etc., as well as social developments (trust-building measures, evidence-based policy making, social innovation (e.g. project B-TRUST, funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-6: Co-creation and trust-building measures for biotechnology and bio-based innovation systems). Also, the action may take into consideration the outputs from the parallel topics, such as HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-ZEROPOLLUTION-02: Environmental impacts from the production of agricultural crops for bio-based industrial systems, or HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-13: Raising citizen awareness on alternative proteins, including those derived from biotechnology , as well the results of the European Commission study on “Supporting the green transition via the EU Industrial Strategy: opportunities and challenges for bioeconomy, through bio-based industrial systems and biotechnology in the EU” .\nThe action will then provide scientifically robust assessment of the social, economic and environmental benefits and risks of biotechnologies and biomanufacturing and deliver recommendations in form of a consolidated EU vision and research and innovation agenda, on future trends and main innovation avenues. This action will contribute to the implementation of the EU biotechnology and biomanufacturing Initiative, in particular by developing guidance to stakeholders, such as SMEs, start-ups or civil society.\nIt should also explore the role of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in terms of knowledge needs around the potential positive impacts and potential risks of biotechnology, including on biodiversity and ecosystems, e.g., resource efficiency, sustainable biomass management, impacts on air, water and soil quality or capacity of bio-based systems to enable a sustainable carbon management and better understanding of the carbon removal potential of bio-based economies.\nFurthermore, the action should inform the policy makers on national level, as an input to new or updated national bioeconomy strategies or roadmaps. Given that biotechnology has been identified as a critical technology from the economic security perspective [2] , due to its cross-cutting nature, and also as one of the technologies prioritised in the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) Regulation [3] , such aspects should be covered by the present action.\nProposals should take into account the findings of the Global Resources Outlook 2024 of the International Resource Panel. The proposals under the topic should ensure best use of outcomes from previous projects on biotechnology (some of which are already referenced in the topic), for building consumer trust regardless of regulatory status of the products. To promote this, mapping use cases from past projects should be included. Furthermore, synergies with projects on biotechnology/biomanufacturing pilot infrastructure, such as projects Pilots4U and Copilot (under BBI-JU and CBE-JU, respectively) is encouraged, given they may enable the accessibility to pilot infrastructure to bring biotech/biomanufacturing initiatives to the market.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, e.g. with countries mentioned in the communication on the EU biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative, such as the United States of America, Japan, South Korea, and India, for win-win outcomes and mutual benefits.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.\n[1] Nature-based solutions - European Commission (europa.eu) COM(2024) 137 Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU\n[2] Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/2113 of 3 October 2023 on critical technology areas for the EU’s economic security for further risk assessment with Member States.\n[3] Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (‘STEP’) and amending Directive 2003/87/EC, Regulations (EU) 2021/1058, (EU) 2021/1056, (EU) 2021/1057, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) 2021/1060, (EU) 2021/523, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697 and (EU) 2021/24, COM/2023/335 final.",

In fact, on one side, industrial bio-based systems may be affected by a higher energy consumption; on the other side, energy supplies may experience shortage and/or price fluctuations that make the most energy-intensive sectors more vulnerable. Industrial bio-based systems within the scope of this topic do not include food/feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural/recreation sectors.\nProposals should select one or more case-studies of bio-based industrial systems, within the scope of the topic, in the EU and Associated Countries and:\n- describe how to improve energy efficiency, developing and implementing, for example: energy efficient (thermal) separation technologies (e.g., membrane distillation); fast and energy efficient drying processes of biomass (e.g., for wood residues, algae residues, and other residual streams); optimized catalysts, enzymatic processes and reactors to save energy, etc.. analyse the rebound effect of energy saving measures and how to address them;\n- analyse the nexus water-energy in the processes of the selected bio-based industrial systems and how the reduction of water consumption contributes to energy saving, e.g., in separation and purification processes, as well as how to address the water-energy integration within the factory by considering the whole processes and all the utilities;\n- describe how to enable energy consumption flexibility through the optimization of processes with faster response rate to be flexible to variable energy supply, (e.g., by slowing production when less energy available, and prices are high, or increasing the production and/or storing energy and energy carriers onsite when surplus of energy is available, and prices are low);\n- analyse the implementation of renewable energy use in the selected bio-based industrial systems, including shifting from fossil-based to renewable resources and/or shifting to electrification;\n- include a task in the project to demonstrate the solutions analysed under the previous four bullet points, to i) improve energy efficiency; ii) integrate water-energy nexus; iii) enable energy consumption flexibility; iv) use renewable energy. Such solutions should be demonstrated on one or more of the selected case-studies, and should be optimized, also through the applications of digital tools including based on artificial intelligence. Assess the contribution to climate neutrality of the selected solutions.\nFor increased resource efficiency (water and energy use) and circular economy (e.g. minimisation of waste generation or raw materials use) in large industrial installations, please refer to the Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/).\nThe multi-actor approach is encouraged.\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.",

      "scope": "From 31 December 2023, EU Member States must collect bio-waste separately. The Waste Framework Directive allows waste which complies with relevant standards for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation, to be collected together with bio-waste. For example, the collection of bio-waste with industrially compostable plastic bags is encouraged (Communication on “EU policy framework on biobased, biodegradable and compostable plastics” COM(2022)). However, industrial composting facilities in the EU are often unable to biodegrade such packaging due to different performances of composting processes than those required for the biodegradation of compostable packaging compliant with the standard EN 13432. Harmonization of the performances of industrial composting plants in the EU would help meeting the targets for bio-waste collection and the quality of resulting compost.\nProposals should:\n- analyse the technical performances of industrial composting plants, with a special focus on the treatment of compostable packaging, at EU and at global scale. Compostable packaging in the EU is compliant with the standard EN 13432. The analysis should address the environmental impacts of composting plants, including emissions of pollutants to air/water/soil, emissions of odours and energy consumption, and the quality and safety of the product (e.g., control of pathogens in compost), also monitoring potential changes in the microbial communities in presence of compostable materials;\n- include a task for the project to select ad hoc performance parameters to define the best practices of industrial composting plants, ensuring the full biodegradation of compostable packaging;\n- describe how the project will deliver a collection and assessment of the best practices of industrial composting, at EU and global level, ensuring the full biodegradation of compostable packaging, and will individuate promising innovation, e.g., microbial bioaugmentation strategies to improve composting performances in a range of conditions, to generate high quality compost, and/or to biodegrade pollutants commonly present in compost waste (i.e., microplastics);\n- include a task for the project to provide recommendations towards the harmonization of EU industrial compositing processes and conditions, ensuring the full biodegradation of compostable packaging sustainably and safely and delivering safe and sustainable compost, as well as recommendations on improving the environmental performances of such plants, in terms of emissions of pollutants to air/water/soil and of odours.\nInternational cooperation and multi-actor approach, including the involvement of waste managers in municipalities, are encouraged.",

      "scope": "The recent wars, some of which are taking place at or near the EU borders, in particular the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression of Russia on Ukraine, and the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, are causing not only tragic loss of human life and human suffering, but also serious environmental degradation, across ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic, and in consequence biodiversity loss. Beyond the EU’s borders, conflicts and fragility also persist where communities are affected by recurring or endemic conflicts with no real efforts to reconstruct, much less to build back better and greener. In this context, the options for the reconstruction process offered by the innovative bio-based solutions should be explored and seized. There is also a clear urgency to assess the resilience of solutions, map and deploy the remedies arising from both bio-based innovation and from nature-based solutions to address the reconstruction of such areas, both rural, coastal and urban, to promote the ‘build back better and greener’ concept, thus contributing to adaptation to climate change.\nThe action covers the development of practical solutions to achieve reconstruction efforts and strategies for restoring and ‘renaturing’ destroyed areas, made possible by bio-based innovation (including, i.e. the role of biotechnology, digital solutions, or bio-based construction materials), taking into account the circular and cascading use of biomass principles, local valorisation of underutilised biological residues, using nature-based solutions for their potential for bringing back biodiversity and restoring areas degraded or destroyed by conflicts, and overall, more sustainable and more environmentally-friendly management of biological resources. The aspect of the disaster risk reduction can be also included, if relevant. Covering the potential use of the bio-based innovation and nature-based solutions and their interplay in the humanitarian relief sphere and preparing for the deployment of concrete and human-centric applications is strongly encouraged. The higher sustainability of circular bio-based materials should be confirmed by the LCA approach, as much as possible.\nSynergies with ongoing projects are encouraged, e.g. those funded under topics HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01-06: Bio-based solutions for humanitarian applications or HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-05: Revitalisation of European local (rural/peri-urban) communities with innovative bio-based business models and social innovation , upcoming topics (e.g. HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-ZEROPOLLUTION-03: Environmental biotechnology applications in service of restoration of polluted ecosystems, as well as with the actions supported under the New European Bauhaus (NEB) Facility. In addition, synergies with the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities, and with LIFE projects, are encouraged, notably the ones which contributed to the Ukraine Green Recovery Conference [1] .\nProposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded under this topic and with similar recent or ongoing projects (some of which are referenced in the topic).\nProposals should take into account the findings of the Global Resources Outlook 2024 of the International Resource Panel.\nSocial Sciences and Humanities aspects, including gender dimension, social innovation are to be covered, to ensure an inclusive engagement of all key stakeholders. The multi-actor approach (MAA) is encouraged.\nThe action will provide recommendations to policymakers and EU and international relief organisations, to develop any replication actions, including in the context of the possible EU accession process, if relevant. International cooperation is strongly encouraged.\nThe JRC may provide support in research activities related the application of circular and bio-based materials in the rapid rebuilding of conflict-affected regions.\n[1] Ukraine Green Recovery Conference - European Commission (europa.eu)",

      "scope": "The immense diversity of marine/aquatic micro- and macro-organisms and their communities represents a rich and largely unexplored reservoir of natural products and their base ingredients. To survive in habitats ranging from deep-sea sediments to polar regions or shallow waters, marine organisms have developed a broad spectrum of structures, defense mechanisms and metabolic pathways resulting in natural products with vast chemical diversity and wide range of biological activities. The biological interplay between interspecies communities, e.g. symbiotic or defence mechanisms, may offer attractive leads and is also in scope. For the coverage of terrestrial bioprospecting see parallel topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-08: Bioprospecting and optimized production of the terrestrial natural products: new opportunities for bio-based sectors.\nThe action covers modern biodiscovery approaches including, in-silico bioprospecting and the full integration of digital methods (e.g., statistics, algorithms, AI, data science, modelling, digital twins) with bioinformatics and biotechnological tools, which make possible the identification and production of bioactive natural compounds with potential high-value application in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, food/feed additives, agrochemicals, etc. In the context of this topic, natural products are understood as biologically active products such as secondary metabolites as well as enzymes derived from marine/aquatic organisms.\nTargeted marine/aquatic biological resources can be sourced from their natural environment (in-situ) and/or from open access and public/private collections and gene-banks (ex-situ).\nThe aim is to broaden the range of novel compounds, lowering the production costs, quicken the development pipeline, and enable more innovation for the industrial operators, with clear-cut benefits for the final users. Projects should have a strong industry drive and include demonstration activities to proof the techno/economic viability of the production of the proposed marine/aquatic natural product(s) and/or the biodiscovery platform tools combining digital and biotechnologies.\nThe scope covers relevant steps of the biodiscovery process such as isolation and characterization of microbial strains and consortia, genomic characterisation, creation of natural product libraries, bioactivity screening, natural products isolation and purification, chemical structure elucidation or optimized production pathways via biotechnology and biomanufacturing approaches in suitable industrial facilities (bioreactors/biorefineries, e.g. for microbial production), synthetic biology or gene editing. The integration of digital approaches (AI, computer algorithms such as machine learning, modelling, data science etc) on optimizing the biodiscovery processes such as identification of biosynthetic gene clusters and metabolic pathways, enzyme selection, combinatorial assembly and annotation of high-throughput DNA sequencing data, bioactivity prediction, elucidation of the structure of compounds, experimental design etc is in scope. Safety to the end-users and operators needs to be assessed and guaranteed.\nProposals should avoid overlaps with past or ongoing topics (e.g. projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CIRCBIO-02-05-two-stage: Life sciences and their convergence with digital technologies for prospecting, understanding and sustainably using biological resources, topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01: Broadening the spectrum of robust enzymes and microbial hosts in industrial biotechnology), consider synergies to parallel actions (e.g. HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-08: Bioprospecting and optimized production of the terrestrial natural products: new opportunities for bio-based sectors as well as funded under the topic HORIZON-2020-FNR-11-2020 - Prospecting aquatic and terrestrial natural biological resources for biologically active compounds [1] ). The action is expected to establish links with relevant projects funded under the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters.\nThe action needs to guarantee biodiversity preservation. This can be addressed, inter alia, by covering propagation of biological material, including by in vitro cultivation, as well as by biotechnology approaches. The action needs to comply with applicable EU regulations and international rules on access to biological resources, their sustainable use and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from their utilisation, including the Nagoya protocol, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF), and the agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). A life-cycle assessment should be carried out to evaluate the environmental, economic, and social impact of the developed product(s). Proposals should contribute to the understanding of potential trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of ecosystems, their potential to deliver ecosystem services and ideally provide solution approaches to address these trade-offs. Potential risks to the environment, ecosystems, and society as well as benefits should also be assessed under this topic.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as EU-OPENSCREEN, ELIXIR, EMBRC ERIC, IBISBA or other relevant research infrastructures 138 .\n[1] https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_FNR-11-2020/en",

New knowledge and tools for the timely, consistent, and comprehensive monitoring of forest condition, biodiversity, resilience, and productivity;\n- new knowledge, methods, and processes to support major transitions (including increased carbon removals and the restoration of forest ecosystems) and innovations in the sustainable forest-based bioeconomy are developed towards higher added value;\n- better understanding of the trends and bottlenecks in the new green forestry business models, including carbon farming, ecotourism and payments for environmental services.",
      "scope": "As the main instrument for public organisations in EU Member States and Associated Countries to collaborate in the forest-based sectors, the partnership will facilitate concerted research and innovation actions on Europe's diverse forestry challenges, with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders, thus reducing fragmentation of related R&I.\nThe partnership should mobilise key partners and stakeholders, including ministries in charge of research, forest-related areas, and environment, funding agencies, research performing organisations, research infrastructures, foresters, industry, NGOs, international networks, etc.\nThe partnership should align with transnational research and innovation activities, as defined in its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) and address all the following:\n- identify R&I priorities to strengthen alignment of European and national research, development and innovation programmes and to increase their policy relevance;\n- develop new knowledge and innovative solutions for a systemic and inclusive approach to forest and forestry challenges, looking for synergies in complementary actions and trade-offs between competing actions;\n- reinforce the European collaboration on improving the understanding of resilience of forest ecosystems and forest-based sectors, and their underlying constituents to multiple hazards, driven by ongoing climate change and other human made impacts as a basis for adaptation and mitigation measures;\n- strike an optimal balance in a range of forest functions and related societal values, including views of different stakeholders, thus responding to societal expectations while supporting the forest industry in a transition towards a greener and circular bioeconomy;\n- focus on the multifunctional role and the sustainable management of forests as well as the interplay between forestry biomes, regimes and the continuous provision of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and resilience to climate change (drought, fire, pests and diseases, compound and cascading risks etc.) as well as climate adaptation;\n- consider the cascading use of forest products and higher added value, supporting business and social enterprise development (creating employment and quality job opportunities and diversified revenue for foresters) in rural areas and industrial development in crucial sectors such as sustainable forest-based industries (traditional and emerging branches), construction, transport, and energy;\n- stronger focus on the processes that lead to transformations toward sustainability in the forest-based and bioeconomy sector at European level, which will also be key to the forest industry´s long-term competitiveness, in Europe and globally;\n- ensure forests and forest management monitoring to ultimately anticipate future developments, provide early alerts on disturbances (e.g., pest outbreaks and climate change driven impacts), and assess the impact of forestry practices on forest and forest soil health and conservation and local communities;\n- increase and strengthen international cooperation to develop a critical mass in relation to the global challenges faced including climate mitigation and imported deforestation.\nThe partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to Countries Associated to Horizon Europe. Specific action should be taken to integrate Ukraine in the Partnership to strengthen European sustainable forest management. Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contribution, in line with the level of ambition of the proposed activities. The partnership should be open to include new partners over its lifetime. Its governance should allow for engaging a broad range of stakeholders, together with the full members of the partnership. Guidelines, standards, and legislation in the field should be taken into consideration, to facilitate the marketing of the methods and products developed in the partnership.\nThe partnership should allocate resources to cooperate with existing projects, initiatives, platforms, science-policy interfaces, and/or institutional processes at European level, and at other levels where relevant to the partnership’s goals.\nTo ensure that all work streams are coherent and complementary, and to leverage knowledge and innovation investment potential, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with the Horizon Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’, ‘Adaptation to Climate Change’, and ‘Climate-neutral and Smart Cities’, with the existing European Partnerships Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU), Biodiversa+, Water4All, Agroecology, Built4People, Sustainable Food Systems, and with other relevant future partnerships, in particular the project that may follow from the topic “HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data”. Where relevant, creating links and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus are encouraged.\nCooperation with the JRC may be envisaged, in particular for actions related to forest monitoring and forest management.\nProposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes to implement joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. The partnership will provide financial support to third parties as one of the means to achieve its objectives. To explore the full range of financing options available under Horizon Europe, the general annexes of the main Work Programme setting out the general conditions applicable to calls and topics for grants should be considered.\nTo achieve the international cooperation objectives, and given the global dimension of forests, collaboration with strategic third country partners with proven added value in the field of forests and forestry is strongly encouraged. In particular, the participation of legal entities from international countries and/or regions, including those not automatically eligible for funding, is encouraged in the transnational co-funded calls and/or in other activities of the partnership. Cooperation with international organisations may be considered.\nApplicants are expected to describe in detail how they would carry out this collaborative work in practice.\nEfforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities disciplines.\nIn order to enhance the societal impact of the activities, the approach should empower citizens to contribute to the co-design/co-creation/co-assessment of research and innovation agendas/contents/outcomes.\nCross-articulation with data spaces, and notably with the European Open Science Cloud should be foreseen, exploiting synergies and complementarities of the different approaches.\nThe Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.\nThe expected duration of the partnership is seven to ten years.",

      "scope": "The revised Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD) complements the European Green Deal and is a key action in the Commission’s zero pollution action plan. It seeks to align EU air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations and to better support national and local authorities in achieving cleaner air through strengthening air quality monitoring and modelling and improving air quality plans. For these objectives, several challenges will need to be overcome in the coming years, particularly when it comes to the improvement of accuracy, comparability and real-time nature of monitoring and modelling to assess air quality in Member States and Associated Countries referring to already regulated air pollutants facing stricter limit values (main pollutants include PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, benzene, and O3) and to air pollutants of emerging concern (such as ultra-fine particles – including nano-particles of all kinds, black carbon, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, oxidative potential for particulate matter) and their source apportionment. The proposals are expected to:\n- develop or improve cost-effective monitoring and modelling tools, approaches and methods for different types of well-known and emerging air pollutants and pollution sources, addressing the most urgent needs in measurement accuracy (including temporal aspects such as real-time monitoring and modelling) and dispersion mapping, in support of the implementation of the revised AAQD;\n- develop methodologies and recommendations for designing optimal monitoring networks, considering relevant aspects of different spatial locations (hotspots as well as urban and rural background locations), combining traditional reference measurements and innovative measurement techniques, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of innovative low-cost sensors. Recommendations should consider also funding challenges and opportunities;\n- improve the processing and integration of in situ, ground-based remote sensing and satellite (e.g. Sentinels) observations, and air quality numerical models utilising various methods, like for example AI algorithms and finite elements modelling.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects and initiatives with a relevant air quality monitoring and/or modelling component to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid duplication. These could include, but are not limited to, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects (potentially those funded under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-6), research infrastructures (for example, ACTRIS ERIC), as well as relevant LIFE integrated projects for clean air. Proposed activities should, where possible, build on results of and cooperate with AQUILA and FAIRMODE [1] communities. Furthermore, this topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on Earth System Science. The proposals should articulate how they will coordinate with current and future actions funded by ESA’s Future EO programme within ESA atmospheric science cluster.\nThe integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\n[1] https://fairmode.jrc.ec.europa.eu/",

The scope of the topic focusses on the environmental impacts from biomass production, not covering the full life cycle of the uses of such biomass, nor the valorisation of waste and residues.\nProposals should:\n- identify the types of primary agricultural crops currently produced for bio-based products within the scope of this topic at EU and Associated Countries scale;\n- include a task for the project to collect data and figures on volumes and geographical distribution of the identified primary agricultural crops traded within the EU and Associated Countries, and from outside the EU towards the EU and Associated Countries. In the cases of primary agricultural crops grown in the EU and Associated Countries, collect data on type of land used and of pedo-climatic zones, cultivation systems and agronomic practices (crop diversification, intercropping, cultivation of catch-crops, etc);\n- analyse the environmental impacts of the identified primary agricultural crops produced for industrial purposes and identified under the first bullet of this scope. The analysis should be based on literature data and potentially applying Environmental Footprint methods as described in Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279;\n- include a task for the project to assess quantitatively such environmental impacts and trade-offs addressing, but not limiting to, the following environmental categories: i) GHG emissions/savings and carbon footprint, including temporary carbon removals; ii) emissions to air/water/soil from nitrogen and phosphorous based fertilisers; iii) land use and land use change and its related impact on land carbon sink capacity; iv) water use; v) biodiversity and ecosystem services; vi) energy consumption, vii) any other aspects of air/water/soil environmental quality. The quantitative assessment should consider the range of climatic and land conditions, for each primary agricultural crop, due to the geographical distribution. It should be based on data from literature and stakeholders’ consultations and potentially applying Environmental Footprint methods as described in Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279. Based on such assessment, individuate best practices and the means to share them among concerned stakeholders.\nProposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with similar recent or ongoing projects, e.g., MIDAS and MarginUp funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CIRCBIO-01-02-Marginal lands and climate-resilient and biodiversity-friendly crops for sustainable industrial feedstocks and related value chains.\nMulti-actor approach and international cooperation, especially with Latin–America and the Caribbean, are encouraged.",

Moreover, in case both the exposure of soil, sediment and water to degrading factors and their vulnerability are high, whereas their resilience is low, the degradation may take the dimension of a disaster. The scope of this topic is the remediation of contaminated soil, sediment and water from pollutants, such as hazardous chemicals, pharmaceutical and waste, including litter and plastics, and their further restoration, including in case of accidents and disasters driven by anthropogenic activities and extreme climate and environmental events. The results from projects funded under this topic will contribute to one of the restoration measures included in the Nature Restoration Regulation to (Annex VII, point (32) Stop, reduce or remediate pollution from pharmaceuticals, hazardous chemicals, urban and industrial wastewater, and other waste including litter and plastics as well as light in all ecosystems ).

The task should include the assessment of the alignment with the precautionary principle, environmental sustainability and efficiency of the developed solutions in remediating soil, sediment and water, also addressing biodiversity loss and the functional state of the ecosystems. Moreover, it should evaluate the improvement of resilience to the impacts of climate change on the affected ecosystems, due to the applications of the developed solutions;\n- include a task in the project on the development of models enabled by digital innovation, including based on artificial intelligence, for the optimization of remediation approaches, also in case of emergency facing disaster sand extreme climate and environmental events like fires, droughts, floods, etc.;\n- identify and assess the economic, social and safety risks and benefits of the remediation activities in the selected case-studies, in particular in terms of circular economy and of the reduction of the risks for human health resulting from exposure to the contaminants (e.g., vulnerable populations, integrating the gender dimension). The risk reduction should take into consideration the bioavailability and mobility of the contaminants, including heavy metals, other metals (e.g., the ones used in electronic devices, Li, REE, etc.), plastics and organic chemicals (i.e., PFAS, PAHs, pesticides, etc.);\n- include a task in the project to deliver the overall environmental, economic, social and safety risk assessment for the developed integrated bio-based and nature-based solutions.\nProposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with all projects funded under this topic and with similar recent or ongoing projects, e.g., those funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-10: Environmental services: improved bioremediation and revitalization strategies for soil, sediments and water, or under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-6: Biosensors and user-friendly diagnostic tools for environmental services.\nIntegrating Citizen Science in research approach is encouraged to contribute to the selection and analysis of case-studies of degraded ecosystems.

      "scope": "The monitoring and assessment of litter including plastic, microplastic and nanoplastic pollution in Europe’s marine and freshwater environment remains fragmented and diverse, although progress has been made under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) for monitoring quantities and impacts of marine litter and harmonised guidance for monitoring has been produced [1] . However, large discrepancies between countries, marine regions, litter types and environmental compartments can still be observed and large data and knowledge gaps persist on the sources, pathways, distribution and concentrations of litter in marine and freshwater, which are impeding comprehensive assessments of the extent of litter pollution including microplastics in EU waters. Different approaches for assessing and monitoring litter pollution in freshwater and marine environments are further hindering such assessments.\nDespite the large amount of literature and recent scientific advancements to develop reliable and harmonised analytical research methodologies, guidance, protocols and reference materials, pan-European approaches and strategies that set out what to measure, where to measure, when to measure and how to measure are missing.\nActions should in particular inform monitoring and assessments, including threshold setting, under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and more broadly support its implementation, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the zero pollution action plan, the evaluation and possible revision of the Single Use Plastics Directive as well as EU initiatives on microplastics (such as under REACH and reduction of plastic pellets releases). Actions will also contribute to the planned Global Agreement to End Plastic Pollution and the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will contribute significantly at EU level to all of the following:\n- enhance data acquisition, quality assurance and quality control approaches, and effective use of available data from source-to-sea including lake, riverine, groundwater, coastline, sea surface and seabed monitoring of (plastic) litter including (different types of) microplastics, making use of diverse data sources (incl. data collected by citizen science initiatives) and new technologies to improve quantitative knowledge on pollution sources, pathways, spatial distribution and accumulation zones, including on the seabed, leakage and transport at EU scale and at basin level;\n- develop scientific approaches as well as environmentally relevant reference materials and matrices needed to design harmonised methods for detecting, identifying, classifying, and quantifying plastic and microplastic pollution in realistic conditions, which will enable a comprehensive assessment of the exposure of aquatic biodiversity to litter;\n- improve tools and methodologies for efficient and where possible autonomous sampling, developing rapid and reliable analytical methods and imaging techniques for seabed macro litter and monitoring of microplastic pollution to address policy needs;\n- develop analytical methods for detecting, characterising and monitoring nanoplastic particles in aquatic environments;\n- develop, improve and implement fit-for-purpose, optimised, validated, harmonised and cost-effective monitoring strategies for freshwater, coastal and marine environments and collaborative data collection across borders, which need to be implemented on a sufficient scale to assess the problem;\n- enable the uptake of monitoring data in large scale databases (e.g. the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Digital Twin of the Ocean) following FAIR principles, to ensure public data accessibility and use and foster a comprehensive assessments of litter pollution at European level.\nThe action is expected to build on the work and engage with the Technical Group on Marine Litter under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which is co-led by the JRC. It should build on the outcomes and establish links with relevant projects, including projects funded under the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and its Mediterranean lighthouse (e.g. the projects PlasticPirates – Go Europe! [2] , UPSTREAM [3] , INSPIRE [4] and topic HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-02: A toolbox for public authorities to address marine plastics and litter from river-to-ocean), the EUROqCHARM [5] project and JPI Oceans microplastics projects.\nThe action should also contribute to regional and global efforts on monitoring plastic pollution in the ocean and waters, by building links with activities of relevant regional seas conventions, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and contributing to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Proposals should also build on and contribute to the GEO Blue Planet initiative and the Integrated Marine Debris Observing System (IMDOS) in cooperation with GOOS and UNEP. Proposals are encouraged to liaise with and consider the services offered by, where relevant, European research infrastructures [6] .\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, including with All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance partner countries.

      "scope": "Marine pollutants cause harmful effects on marine species and wildlife, serious negative impacts on the structure and functioning of ecosystems, the goods and services they provide, and ultimately on human health, wellbeing and prosperity.\nWhile there have been significant advances in understanding the effects of individual pollutants on marine life, the cumulative effects of different marine pollutants, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pharmaceuticals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), heavy metals and trace elements, micro- and nano plastics, nanomaterials, biodegradable products, microbiological contaminants, pesticides, fertilisers and nutrients, and the associated risks for marine life are not fully understood. The interplay of climate change (and the resulting effects of a warming and more acidic ocean) with pollutants including actual and predicted changes in their bioavailability, toxicity and water quality, need to be further examined including (gender-specific) implications for human health following a ‘One-Health’ [1] approach.\nR&I in this area is therefore expected to support the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, in particular the assessments of the adverse effects of pollutants, including cumulative effects, on the health of species and habitats in line with Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848, the Water Framework Directive, the zero pollution action plan, the objectives of protecting and restoring ecosystems of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the evaluation and possible revision of the Single Use Plastics Directive, the planned Global Agreement to End Plastic Pollution and contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.\nMarine litter and marine plastic pollution is a particularly pervasive global problem, with particularly high concentrations observed in European seas as well in Southeast Asia. R&I in this area have thus been identified as a priority by the EU-India Trade and Technology Council’s Working Group on Green and Clean Energy Technology to reinforce bilateral cooperation.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will contribute significantly to:\n- develop new analytical tools, methods and sensors for the screening, detection, identification and monitoring of different pollutants in the marine environment such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pharmaceuticals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), heavy metals and micro- and nano plastics including their degradation products, microbiological contaminants, pesticides, fertilisers and nutrients;\n- advance assessments of the risks in real conditions, accumulation, exposure (incl. low-level) and ecotoxicological effects (e.g., on endocrine systems, fertility, metabolism, neurological development and behaviour, growth as well as genetic and physiological changes) of these pollutants on marine organisms and (vulnerable) populations including seabed habitats, benthic communities, endangered species and species for human consumption, incl. risks associated with effects such as harmful algal blooms;\n- analyse the cumulative impacts of a combination of different pollutants (‘cocktail effect’), their degradation pathways in ecosystems and organisms, and their interplay with climate change such as changes in bioavailability, toxicity and water quality on marine organisms and populations;\n- assess bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes of pollutants in the marine food chain including in seafood and implications for human health including and variations in effects on e.g., different sexes or age groups.\nProposals should build on the outcomes and establish links with relevant projects, including those funded under the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and its Mediterranean lighthouse, and the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean and relevant JPI Oceans projects. Proposals are encouraged to liaise with and consider the services offered by, where relevant, European research infrastructures [2] .\nThis topic is within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in relation to marine litter. For the purposes of this topic, the Ministry of Earth Sciences of the Government of India has made the required co-funding available for associated partners in selected projects.\n[1] One Health - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

In that way, the proposal should encourage farming systems to prevent and reduce pollution in water, air and soil, increase the use efficiency of natural resources, reduce the impact of climate change, and empower farmers to take informed decisions on agricultural inputs and natural resources for environmental and economic sustainability, as described for this destination.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- small- and medium-sized farmers are empowered with innovative digital and data-driven solutions tailored to their specific needs, allowing for the sustainable management of water, nutrients, other inputs and natural resources in conventional and other types of agriculture, including organic farming systems;\n- the digital divide between farms with differing capacities and characteristics is reduced.",
      "scope": "A key challenge for the agricultural sector is to provide food in a context of increasing global population, climate change and price volatility while reducing pollution and preserving natural resources and biodiversity for future generations. Farmers should be able to adopt innovative solutions to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the farming sector while lowering its environmental footprint. However, still many farmers, particularly small- and medium-sized ones, do not have easy access to monitoring and decision support systems and tools fed with data reflecting local conditions and farm characteristics.\nDigital and data technologies offer solutions to monitor environmental parameters (e.g. soil conditions, water and air quality, nutrients content and availability) in a cost-efficient manner while supporting decision-making of natural resources and inputs management.\nProposals should:\n- critically analyse the potential and limitations of R&I results from relevant past and ongoing projects, and the requirements of further development to meet farmers’ needs (including a cost-benefit analysis), made available to industrial partners (including SMEs) that provide technological solutions to farmers to monitor and manage natural resources and agricultural inputs. This should be in the form of a structured catalogue of these results relevant to the topic such as new sensors, software, databases, applications, methodologies, algorithms, etc. (non-exhaustive list), and covering different farming systems/approaches, including organic farming;\n- identify barriers and enablers for translation of R&I results into practical and commercial tools for small- and medium-sized farmers, and for the uptake by these end-users, as well as characterise remaining knowledge, training and/or advice gaps, and needs for policy feedback;\n- design and set up an accessible and searchable web-based database with technical descriptions and relevant information of all the available results from the catalogue in a structured way, making concrete efforts to follow the FAIR principles;\n- set up a central brokerage and support service point aimed at matching innovation ideas from industrial partners that want to improve or create new products or services with the needs of small- and medium-sized farmers. These developments include, for example, increasing the number of measured parameters on existing devices, improving precision, automation, integration of systems and decision-making tools considering the diverse pedo-climatic, cropping and social conditions across the EU and Associated Countries while checking also the transferability to other regions with similar characteristics. The service should be free of charge for the industrial partners;\n- establish a network of research and innovation providers and intermediaries with capacity to support the industrial partners to identify and develop the newly adapted solutions;\n- provide innovations based on digital and data-based solutions (e.g. IoT, remote sensing, sensors, (generative) artificial intelligence, data visualization techniques) and tailored to the needs of small- and medium-sized farmers, carefully considering the specific barriers and enablers for adoption in each context (e.g. skills of end users, access to and understanding of digital tools, availability of local data, investment need, connectivity, gender role perceptions and expectations, diverse pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions across the EU and Associated Countries, etc.) and proposing how to overcome these difficulties and foster the enablers;\n- develop prototypes of the innovations and test them in an operational environment;\n- set up a community of practice to facilitate science-business exchanges and to share experiences across the EU and Associated Countries. Complementarities with European and national AKIS knowledge channels or similar should be explored;\n- propose a clear strategy to disseminate and exploit results, innovations and best practices during and beyond the project lifetime;\n- monitor progress of the different innovations delivered by the supported third parties, taking stock of good practices and contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the topic.\nProposals should implement the multi-actor approach, involving at least scientists, private companies, innovators, advisors and farmers to ensure a functional and effective product which is tailored to the farmers’ needs.\nProposals should provide financial support to third parties to help private partners to develop those innovative products primarily building on the technologies identified in the catalogue. It is expected that minimum 50% and maximum 65% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define a selection process for the industrial partners for which financial support may be granted. The provision of training (including technical guidelines and ad-hoc materials) and support services to farmers and advisers should be considered as a criterion to grant financial support to these third parties.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines, especially in the field of behavioural sciences and adoption of technologies.",

      "scope": "Food systems, on the one hand, are a source of pollution and, on the other hand, suffer from the consequences of pollution. Moving towards zero pollution food systems can therefore contribute to building the resilience of food systems and the natural ecosystems on which they depend. Contaminants have been accumulating in food products, whether due to food being in contact with specific materials at various stages of the food supply chain, such as food processing plants, packaging, or in agriculture with contaminated soils, air and water.\nIn the context of the Industrial and Livestock Rearing Emissions Directive and the relevant Best Available Techniques (BAT) conclusions for the food, drink and milk industries, some data are already available. However, there are currently several knowledge gaps when it comes to emerging and/or less known pollutants, and their cocktail effects on the environment and human health.\nSome activities of the food and drink industries can lead to soil, water and air pollution, which can, in turn, adversely affect food safety, biodiversity and human health. This pollution can take many forms: plastics (including micro- and nano-plastics), food packaging, persistent chemicals, light, noise, odour, etc. There are significant regional differences in the impact of environmental pollution, depending on the type of pollutant. While European and national strategies remain important to reducing pollution, international cooperation is key to ensure that efficient and impactful measures are put in place to protect our oceans and inland waters, ecosystems, biodiversity and health.\nThe proposals are expected to:\n- focus on food and drink industries’ processes and on pollutants (including emerging pollutants) typically coming from these industries;\n- develop analytical methods, e.g. using the Environmental Footprint method, to measure pollutants and studying/mapping the pollutants coming from food and drink industries that are not covered in the Best Available Techniques (BAT) conclusions for the food, drink and milk industries and how they interact with each other (mixture of pollutants);\n- propose monitoring/tracking methods for pollutants coming from food and drink industries, focusing on less-known and emerging pollutants specific for food and drink industries and taking into account the diversity of these industries;\n- identify the most effective methods/best available technologies to reduce food-system-related pollution (in soil, water and air) from food and drink industries, focusing on the most relevant/prominent pollutants (the ultimate objective being to eventually stop pollution);\n- develop activities for empowering consumers (e.g. communication, awareness raising);\n- develop activities for ensuring adequate involvement of researchers, national agencies/authorities and laboratories, as well as food and drink industry (incl. strategic innovation platforms and federations).\nThis topic contributes to the European Green Deal priorities, the zero pollution action plan, chemical strategy for sustainability, farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment‑friendly food system, the biodiversity strategy for 2030, notably its objective of reducing pollution, and the EU’s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050. The successful proposal will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co‑benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction, empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.\nFor any activities on depollution to achieve zero pollution in large industrial installations and contribute to the climate ambition, please refer to the Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/).\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting multi-disciplinary research (including on environmental science and biodiversity). International cooperation is strongly encouraged.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects. Projects should have a clear plan as to how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic and any other relevant topic or relevant EU partnerships. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, and common communication and dissemination activities, and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.",

      "scope": "Environmentally safe, socially acceptable, and economically viable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is needed to support the realisation of European and worldwide climate policies. There is considerable uncertainty regarding scalability and the short, medium and long-term effectiveness and impacts on marine ecosystems and human health. Mindful of the precautionary approach, legitimate, responsible, multi and trans-disciplinary, transparent, and inclusive scientific research to evaluate mCDR techniques is urgently needed.\nThe London Protocol also calls for certain activities other than legitimate scientific research to be deferred (LC 45/LP 18 [1] ). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD [2] ) recognizes the importance of biodiversity in the context of climate-related geoengineering. Decision X/33 of the CBD [3] emphasizes the need for a cautious approach, specifying that no climate-related geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity should take place until there is an adequate scientific basis to justify such activities and that small-scale scientific research studies are allowed if conducted in controlled settings and justified by the need for specific scientific data. The CBD also requests the compilation of scientific information on the impacts of geoengineering on biodiversity and the study of gaps in existing mechanisms.\nWhether the ocean has a potential to help achieve the required extent of additional carbon dioxide removal (beyond the ocean sink driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations), while maintaining its integrity and health, requires further research.\nAmong the greatest challenges associated with mCDR technologies is the ability to measure, monitor and verify the amount of additional carbon removed over time, and to assess the environmental effects of the mCDR technology. This is particularly challenging in the ocean environment, an open system with high inertia, globally connected food-webs and high difference in life traits of species in marine life assemblages, for which safety margins need to be considered, and when considering scale up of these technologies would likely require significant additions in hydrodynamically optimum sites, potentially leading to overlaps with repeated, cumulative and/or transboundary exposures and impacts.\nPrincipled ocean CDR research must be precautionary, inclusive, and well-planned, conducted with a view to ensure these technologies are effective, without harming the environment and people. The research conducted under the topic is to be grounded in the Guide to Best Practices in Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Research [4] .\nThe topic is guided by a focus on integrated climate stabilization and biosphere stewardship for the resilience of the entire Earth system. From this perspective, a comprehensive approach to climate and biosphere stewardship is needed, as well as considering all the sustainability dimensions to guide future decisions.\nActions should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one of the following options:\nOption A: Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE): biogeochemical and physiological responses and impacts on marine ecosystems\nThe project is expected to:\n- elucidate many unknowns that remain about the efficacy, effectiveness, feasibility, covering both technological readiness and lead time until full potential effectiveness, effectiveness to increase net carbon uptake, effectiveness to reduce ocean warming, ocean acidification, scalability, duration of effects, termination effects, Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI), environmental and ecological risk (intended, unintended, undesirable consequences at scale), co-benefits, disbenefits, risks, cost effectiveness, externalities, trade-offs, and competing interests, weighing the impact on reducing climate change by OAE against its negative environmental effects, etc. The actions should use a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology and consider all the sustainability dimensions (in particular SDGs 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17), across different temporal and spatial scales;\n- cover the desirability, ethical considerations, social and political considerations and governability from an international perspective, conducting comprehensive and responsible research to inform decision making under climate inertia about OAE and its potential application;\n- carry out comprehensive assessment of the Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) and its short, medium and long term impacts on ocean biogeochemistry (including acidification), on pelagic, coastal and deep ocean ecosystems, their assemblages and trophic webs, on marine organisms that are not able to concentrate carbon within their cells under conditions of increased alkalinity, potentially strong fluctuations in pH and seawater pCO2 impacting plankton and microbiome populations dynamics, species competition and assemblages of connected trophic webs, and calcium hydroxide precipitation threatening coral reefs, plants, periphyton and cyanobacteria due to sensitivity to high levels of turbidity, on primary and second production, on seasonal changes in biogeochemistry and plankton dynamics;\n- conduct an assessment and evaluation of the rate and severity of the local impacts and compare multiple datasets to deliver a greater holistic understanding of OAE’s biological and ecological impacts regionally and globally, on human wellbeing linked to the degree to which the overall changes in primary and secondary production may result in change of species assemblage on which coastal livelihoods depend; the increased accumulation of contaminants within food chains via the release of minerals such as cadmium, nickel, chromium, iron and silicon, with potential implications for human health; the environmental impacts associated with extensive calcium carbonate mining operations, mineral distribution, the energy-intensive oxy-calcination process, dispersion operations, impact on resource scarcity due to high electric consumption, assessment and evaluation of additional resources needed;\n- numerical modelling should be used to assess the scale of the consequences under various scenarios, experimental work in-situ like in mesocosms and benthocosms and ex-situ like in large flow through experimental chambers can help to improve parametrization of geo-biochemical processes. Field experiments are out of scope. The action should improve the precision of predictions and inform ESMs, IAMs and the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP);\n- advance the knowledge related to cost and challenges of carbon accounting, cost of environmental monitoring and the need to track impacts beyond carbon cycle on marine ecosystems.\nOption B: Monitoring the global ocean for safe, verifiable and sustainable potential marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR)\nThe project is expected to:\n- establish building blocks and capabilities towards realistic, long-term, sustainable, rigorous, standardized monitoring of potential marine carbon dioxide removal and sequestration, including operational system requirements, and cover aspects of detection, attribution and determination;\n- advance empirical approaches and new data needed for data-based ocean modelling (vs. numerical simulations) and develop ocean simulation capabilities based on integrated physical, biogeochemical and ecological oceanic components;\n- develop the monitoring capability for quantifying the effectiveness and durability of carbon sequestration, especially in the offshore mesopelagic water column, and identify environmental and ecological short-, medium- and long-term impacts (days to 100s of years) on the ocean and marine ecosystems functioning and the ecosystem services they naturally provide (e.g., biological carbon pump), accounting for climate inertia;\n- enable monitoring the multiple components of the carbonate system and, especially in coastal zones, at appropriate spatial and temporal resolution, and considering existing monitoring schemes and databases, such as the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP) or the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT);\n- utilise enhanced data from observing/modelling to advance scientific knowledge of the ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus and potential impacts of deliberate perturbations (i.e. mCDR). in the ocean, particularly the deep-sea and coastal environments (speed and magnitude of change, thresholds and tipping points), marine ecosystems functioning and the ecosystem services they provide, including carbon and nutrients cycling, climate regulation and fisheries, for future ocean sustainability and decision-making about active climate remediation, trade-offs and policy needs for decision-making under climate inertia.\nFor both options A&B, the actions funded under this topic should have a strong collaboration mechanism. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources, and a plan on how they will collaborate and ensure synergies with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives.\nThe actions should build on existing observing platforms, e.g. in the context of the Copernicus programme, and strengthen and expand the current capacities in an inter and multidisciplinary and ecosystem-based approach.\nThe research carried out should also include SSH perspectives and gender, and the research on desirability, benefits and disbenefits should also be done in relation to desirability for whom, benefits and disbenefits for whom, adding a comprehensive justice perspective on the call, including intergenerational aspects. International cooperation is essential.\nA strong linkage should be ensured with the activities under the UN Decade of Ocean Science and ongoing Horizon projects, the Copernicus marine service (CMEMS), GOOS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), MBON of GEOBON, ICOS, GCOS, and other relevant international Ocean Observing Initiatives. All in-situ data collected should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, and EMODnet). Synergies with the Horizon Europe Mission Restore our Ocean and waters is encouraged. The projects outputs may contribute to the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and the Destination Earth initiative and outline specific plans to this effect.\nThis topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination. Projects should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, Copernicus, as well as data from relevant data spaces in the data-driven analyses. Projects could additionally benefit from access to infrastructure and relevant FAIR data by collaborating with projects funded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03: FAIR and open data sharing in support of healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters and HORIZON-INFRA-2024- EOSC-01-01: FAIR and open data sharing in support of the mission adaptation to climate change.

      "scope": "We face a triple interrelated planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Water is at the heart of these challenges. We can no longer ignore the world’s crisis of water. The global hydrological cycle is changing. During the last three consecutive years, we have also witnessed not only worrying droughts in many regions of the EU, reaching eastern and northern countries which have been so far preserved, but also catastrophic pollution incidents and deadly floods across Europe. These events are no longer exceptional events. As scientists revealed very recently, human-caused climate change has made these episodes at least 20 times more likely. Moreover, groundwater levels sink steadily in Europe and globally, and the EU water balance is greatly perturbed. This increases tensions in agriculture, energy production and water supply and it is threatening drinking water, food and energy security, the health of ecosystems and the services they deliver, and our way of living.\nThese issues are highly interlinked, and they must be addressed together, under the remit of the water, energy, food, and ecosystem (WEFE) nexus. Moreover, recent JRC research shows that reduced freshwater flow of rivers into the sea can have severe impacts on coastal and marine ecosystem and their services, for example wild capture fisheries. This emphasizes the need to adopt the “from the source to the sea” approach when tackling water resilience with a support to biodiversity protection/restoration.\nAccording to the EC communication “Managing climate risks – protecting people and prosperity”, “protecting and restoring the water cycle, promoting a water-smart EU economy and safeguarding good quality, affordable and accessible freshwater supplies to all is crucial to ensure a water-resilient Europe. [...] Water needs to be managed, and human demand needs to be adjusted to the new and more scarce supply”.\nThe objective of this topic is to compare and demonstrate the potential of available state of the art tools to forecast the availability of water resources at the regional and local scale, building also on JRC and other available tools developed for the European scale [1] . It should take into consideration both the global water cycle (blue and green water) and sectoral water demands for both seasonal and long-term horizon, with an integrated water management approach. It should consider water allocation tools for different uses integrating the quality needed for each use, as well as tools for resilient urban planning and water infrastructure management allowing among others run-off control, reducing flood and drought risks, ensuring safety of citizens and infrastructures and support to biodiversity protection/restoration.\nDemonstrations should take place in diverse European regions on a suitable scale e.g., river basin, and should bring together a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including relevant water sectors, water managers and authorities, urban and rural planners, policy makers and the civil society. Solutions aiming at fostering and restoring natural retention measures to keep water in the landscape, mitigating drainage losses, enhancing water retention in watersheds to mitigate extreme events, including both drought and flood, should be explored. Proper attention should be given to actions aiming at overcoming the fragmentation of water monitoring and observation data by strengthening the complementarity between satellites, in situ data, participatory research and integrated assessment models. This should foster the consolidation for better-quality and higher frequency data, reducing uncertainty and increasing trust and making them responsive to end-users' needs.\nAppropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies and tools, such as, tools for resilient urban and rural planning to manage runoff, reduce flood risk and ensure the safety of citizens and water infrastructures, should then be developed to strengthen the resilience of the water sector. These strategies should in particular assess the following:\n- strategies and technical cost-efficient and sustainable solutions for alternative water resources production adapted to the anticipated use;\n- the governance of water resource management to better consider the interlinkages of various water related policies to ensure reliable allocation of water for different uses and cross-sectoral coordination;\n- the suitability of current indicators to appropriately define water efficiency in various sectors and provide a harmonised methodology to increase water efficiency;\n- strategies to anticipate the consequences of recurrent extreme events, including land use analysis (e.g. floods and droughts) and reduce the associated risks;\n- water resilience by exploring water transfer effects for seasonal, annual and pluriannual time-horizon on ecosystems, populations, agriculture, industrial consumption;\n- the suitability of solutions to support biodiversity protection/restoration with attention given to avoiding spread of invasive alien species and to ensuring enough water for entire ecosystems (all species and their populations in healthy state).\nMoreover, the economic foundation of the current water management systems, including water pricing and trade policies, in the context of changing climate should be reviewed to provide elements for a new economic framework helping to better structure the cost of building/operating/monitoring the water infrastructures, increase demand for innovative solutions and strengthen private investments for large scale deployment of these solutions in the water sector.\nProposals should avoid duplication with related ongoing work of the JRC and other EU funded projects, while strengthening complementarities with relevant EU Missions and Partnerships (e.g. Water4All, Biodiversa+). Proposals should build on the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), particularly the forthcoming IPBES nexus assessment. Where relevant, proposals should build on or further enhance existing hydrological modelling tools and water relevant tools and datasets of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, Climate Change and Land Monitoring Services and leverage products and services offered by the from Destination Earth initiatives. Proposals should build synergies and complementarities with other related Horizon Europe projects. To this end, proposals should plan the necessary budget to cover related cluster activities.\nThis action should bring together a wide range of relevant stakeholders, i.e, researchers, technology providers, water utilities, business representatives, investors, policy makers and other water users and citizens to maximise impact. When engaging stakeholders, gender and other social categories (disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic and / or cultural origins, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections, need to be considered. The possible participation of the JRC would ensure that the assessment of available state of the art tools to forecast the availability of water adequately integrates the existing JRC related work.\nDue to the strong socio-economic dimension of water management, the integration of SSH, including gender studies, and Citizen Social Science approach expertise are also needed to ensure the proposed climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies are socially accepted and no one is left behind.\n[1] https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC124342",

      "scope": "While average global temperatures have risen by about 1.5° C globally since pre-industrial times, temperatures in Europe – the fastest warming continent – are rising at about twice that speed. [1] As temperatures rise, previously stable climatic zones (i.e., long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation and their seasonal variations) are shifting towards higher latitudes (towards the poles) and towards higher altitudes (where possible). Arid and semi-arid zones are expanding, while polar and sub-polar zones are shrinking. Precipitation patterns and regimes are also changing across different climatic zones. These changes affect natural as well as managed ecosystems and the services provided by them, altering the distribution and abundance of many plant species and their lifecycles, with consequences for cropping and other forms of agricultural land use, including animal husbandry. Studies show that agro-climatic zones have already moved in the EU over the past 40 years due to climate change, with the fastest shifts observed in Eastern Europe. [2] Recent studies also point towards additional risks resulting from changing ocean currents that might drastically affect weather patterns in parts of Europe in various ways. [3]\nProposals should address the following:\n- by using current and novel evidence, observations and approaches, develop, test and validate dynamic models of the impacts of climate change – also in relation to possible tipping points – on agriculture, taking into account diverse agroecological systems and pedoclimatic conditions and covering the most important expected impacts (including changes in growing season and crop phenology, water demand and availability/quality, soil health and fertility, crop, grassland and livestock productivity, pests/diseases and parasites, etc.).\n- characterise the geo-distribution of cropping systems – also including permanent crops as well as permanent grasslands and other land uses for livestock farming systems, and including currently grown crops as well as others that could be grown under future conditions – in Europe, propose indicators for sustainability, productivity and resilience, and assess production uncertainties, incorporating climate change projections.\n- provide tools for decision-making and business strategies at different levels of action, for evidence-based agricultural land use and management strategies based on climate change trends and quantitative projections, enabling farmers and other practitioners to develop and apply tailored, innovative pathways towards adaptation and, where relevant, restoration in agricultural systems.\nProposals should include a dedicated task and resources for cooperation with the other project(s) funded under this topic and for collaborative actions with other related projects under Horizon Europe, including the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, and under the Agroecology Partnership. [4]\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The role of JRC would be to explore how extremes such as drought and heatwaves will reshape land suitability to crop production under different scenarios exploiting advanced AI techniques. Furthermore, JRC would explore suitability under different tipping point scenarios, linked for instance to a possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH). The integration of existing Earth observation data space ecosystems and the usage of Destination Earth’s Climate Adaptation Digital Twin data is encouraged.\n[1] European Environment Agency, European climate risk assessment: executive summary, EEA Report 01/2024\n[2] European Environment Agency, Climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector in Europe, EEA Report 4/2019\n[3] E.g., Rahmstorf, S. 2024.

      "scope": "In 2021, the EU agricultural sector accounted for approximately 11% of the total GHG emissions in the EU. The bulk of emissions can be attributed to methane and nitrous oxide, stemming from livestock and release from agricultural soils, in particular due to fertiliser application and manure management. Additional efforts are needed in the sector to help meet the EU’s climate targets, in particular climate neutrality by 2050. To promote the uptake of mitigation practices at farm level, better data on their impact and effectiveness are needed. There is also a need for new practical solutions to help farmers monitor and reduce non-CO 2 GHG emissions.\nProposals should:\n- focusing on methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and including indirect sources of N 2 O (soil nitrification/denitrification, ammonia volatilisation, nitrogen leaching), address agricultural practices in manure management, livestock feeding and grazing, soil tillage, fertiliser use and liming in all relevant types of farming systems, including animal husbandry, with a view to developing harmonised metrics and effective mitigation measures;\n- through analysis, field experiments, and demonstration activities, assess and improve the accuracy, effectiveness, efficiency and user-friendliness of MRV tools for the above GHGs, reducing uncertainties via established and novel methods and enabling use of higher tiers for reporting under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Regarding emissions related to fertilisation, this should include a life-cycle perspective addressing also direct and indirect emissions related to the production of different types of fertilisers, notably comparing organic to mineral/chemical fertilisers;\n- improve understanding of linkages between direct non-CO 2 GHG emissions, notably of N 2 O, and other pollutant emissions from agricultural practices (including ammonia), and assess and develop options for reducing trade-offs between mitigation measures for both types of emissions;\n- consolidate and improve knowledge on mitigation measures for agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions, and assess the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration and climate change impacts on those emissions and on options for their mitigation;\n- through dedicated training and outreach activities, build capacity among farmers, farm advisors and other relevant actors for widespread utilisation of improved MRV tools and GHG mitigation measures.\nProposals should include a dedicated task and resources for cooperation with the other project(s) funded under this topic and with other relevant ongoing and forthcoming Horizon Europe project(s) in different Destinations of this Cluster (notably HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-07: “Improving grassland management in European livestock farming systems”) and under the EU Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe” (notably HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-04: “Systems to quantify nitrogen fluxes and uncertainties in European landscapes”). Proposals should address various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming, and cover a range of different pedo-climatic zones.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The role of the JRC would be to model trade-offs between CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions for different farming activities, using MRV tools to support the implementation and further development of the Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) certification framework. [2]\nDue to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China under the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biosolutions (FAB) flagship initiative.\n[1] https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en\n[2] https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en .

      "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership Water4All identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls between 2021 and 2024 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented, in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to the initial proposal, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe scope of the application for this call on the European Partnership Water Security for the Planet should focus on the 2023-27 programmes according to the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years, which includes joint calls for research projects, activities to fostering the uptake of R&I results from various stakeholders, living labs and demonstration sites activities to demonstrate the efficiency of innovative solutions, activities to enhance international collaborations and support the achievement of the water related UN SDGs and transfer of in foreign contexts, where specific challenges can be encountered. Actions to ensure coordination and alignment of EU, national and regional programmes, to strengthen the research/policy interface and all horizontal activities to allow the Partnership to operate and to achieve its specific objectives should be also addressed. Emphasis should also be put on activities contributing to the recently adopted Nature Restoration Regulation, the announced European water resilience strategy and climate adaptation plan.\nIt is expected that the partnership continues to organise joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects.\nSpecific activities to strengthen the complementarities of Water4All partnership with the related Missions, specifically the Missions Adaptation to Climate Change, Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030, and a Soil Deal for Europe and Partnerships (Sustainable Blue Economy, Biodiversa+, Driving Urban Transition and others), identified in the proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under both HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-01 should be also described.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZONCL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All) and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the two first evaluations as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of the topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-01 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and any additional partners to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.\nThe partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joints call for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Synergies with the European Regional Development Fund are encouraged.",

      "scope": "Rural areas cover more than 80% of the EU territory and host approximately 30% of its population. Rural communities and areas provide essential ecosystem services for the whole society, such as food production, energy provision, management of natural resources as well as access to nature and cultural heritage. They play an essential role in the green and digital transitions. However, almost 9 out of 10 predominantly rural regions reported negative crude rates of natural population change during the period 2015–2020. In particular, the number of people aged 65 years or over increased by 1.8% each year in predominately rural regions. By contrast, the number of working-age people (20-64 years old) living in predominantly rural regions fell, on average, by 0.6% each year (EUROSTAT) [1] .\nMany rural areas also face high variation of their populations, such as seasonal peaks that challenge the local infrastructures and services which are often calibrated only on permanent inhabitants. While some are affected more than others by negative demographic trends.\nProposals should address all of the following:\n- advance the understanding of the causes and social (including but not limiting to gender and intersectional differentiations), economic and environmental impacts (including but not limiting to consequences related to land abandonment or land use changes also considering the green transition) of demographic trends;\n- focus on how to support rural communities through evidence-based strategies that includes planning, monitoring of fluctuations, and propose appropriate actions to respond to population changes;\n- find innovative solutions to mitigate and adapt to a changing population in rural areas. Particular attention should be paid to rural areas that are highly exposed to climate change effects.\nThe funded consortium should work on collecting evidence for better planning and develop sustainable and comprehensive long-term strategies for managing a changing population by considering the needs of rural communities. These needs should be identified by using an inclusive multi-actor approach. Consideration of gender and other social categories (disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic and/or cultural origins, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections, must be ensured.\nProposals should test, develop and pilot innovative sustainable solutions that improve the well-being of rural communities based on their needs. In particular, they should focus on providing or co-creating with local communities innovative services that respond to the changing population, foster the sustainable development of strategic sectors, and support job creation in rural areas.\nFinancial support may be provided by the participants to third parties in the form of grants, in particular for the development, testing and piloting of sustainable solutions. If proposals decide to use this option, the consortium should also coordinate activities funded under the financial support to third parties and take stock of results for recommending appropriate policy measures.\nProposals should also focus on the sustainability and replicability of strategies and solutions. Moreover, proposals should develop an accessible tool, also making use of digital technologies, to support local and regional decision-makers to assess demographic impacts and plan for the future with evidence-based strategies in the framework of the just, fair and green transition.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach to involve relevant stakeholders, in particular for the development of innovative solutions, which may include public authorities, rural communities, as well as SMEs, organisations, and social economy actors.\nProposals should build on research done by the EU rural observatory, and by relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe.\nMoreover, proposals should link with the demographic toolbox [2] .\nThis topic must involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH), including gender studies.

      "scope": "At European level, there is a lack of research on the rural real estate issues and different rural areas are affected differently by demographic trends and migration flows. Covid 19, and the new teleworking possibilities also strongly impacted the real estate market in rural areas. Some rural areas are experiencing gentrification processes, others are faced with seasonal touristic flows, while others are affected by depopulation. Affordable and adequate housing, as well as adequate access to services and infrastructure, are not only an essential part of quality of life, but they are also a prerequisite to ensure the attractiveness of a place and therefore the accessibility of labour workforce for strategic sectors for the rural economy.\nProposals should address all of the following:\n- analyse the real estate and rental markets (including short-term and long-term rentals) in rural areas and evaluate housing quality and housing poverty; the analysis should include an evaluation of the demand and supply side and an identification of the stakeholders;\n- contribute to increase data availability, making use also of digital technologies, in relation to type of settlement structures and buildings and include and in-depth analysis of the abandoned or in state of collapse units, showcasing best practise to recover and reuse buildings when socially, economically and environmentally sustainable;\n- increase the understanding of the access to affordable, quality housing and social housing in rural areas considering also financial aspects such as access to finance and price affordability, as well as social aspects such as gender, age, ethnicity, or disability;\n- provide recommendations to policy makers on how to regulate the real estate and rental markets and to promote sustainable, nearly-zero emitting housing renovation or construction where needed to benefit rural communities, including people in a vulnerable situation, and ensure affordable and accessible housing;\n- run participatory processes involving rural stakeholders to design sustainable houses and villages of the future, paying particular attention to affordability and replicability of innovative solutions (including intergenerational, multiuse, and reuse approaches) as well as to the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Solutions should include innovations in terms of improved renovations, insulation, energy and water efficiency and use and reuse of local materials, circularity of materials, as well as of reducing pollution (including air pollution) and soil sealing in rural areas.\nProposals must use the multi-actor approach and involve relevant actors in particular to develop houses and villages of the future.\nProposals should build on research done by the EU rural observatory, and by relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe.\nCollaboration and complementarity with the New European Bauhaus (NEB) Facility is encouraged.\nThis topic must involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH), including gender studies. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as the European social survey (ESS ERIC).",

Building community climate change literacy through creating inclusive learning spaces that also take into account the local cultural heritage and traditional knowledge and are sustainable in the long-term;\n- contribute to the implementation of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) Declaration [2] and particularly the recently agreed area of action [3] on increasing resilience of coastal communities.",
      "scope": "Approximately 1 billion people around the globe inhabit vulnerable low-lying coastal areas facing multiple environmental threats, such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion into coastal ecosystems, increased water temperatures and ocean acidification. The latest IPCC report warns of further intensification of these threats, projecting a tenfold increase in coastal flood damage by the end of the 21 st century and potential damage to coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, economic sectors, livelihoods, and human health. An urgent, coordinated effort to increase coastal resilience [4] has therefore become imperative.\nThe need to develop outcome-oriented science to enhance the resilience of coastal communities was recently prioritised by AAORIA, a science diplomacy initiative focusing on ocean research and innovation. AAORIA partners [5] have a wealth of already existing innovative ideas, knowledge and solutions for enhanced coastal resilience which could be used by coastal communities to create tangible change.\nThe European Commission, together with an AAORIA’s coordination and support action OKEANO, has started to collect this knowledge and make it available to communities around the Atlantic. But considerable effort is still needed to further develop and expand the range of solutions and services to be made accessible to and co-created with the communities.\nThis topic contributes to the implementation of the updated Action Plan for a sustainable, resilient and competitive blue economy in the European Union Atlantic area.\nProposals should address all of the following:\n- engage with Atlantic coastal communities to understand their unique challenges, concerns, current strategies for adaptation to climate change, and traditional environmental knowledge, and to gather valuable insights into the specific needs and priorities of these communities in the context of coastal resilience;\n- work towards enhancing coastal resilience in the Atlantic by building and testing a comprehensive toolbox [6] of scientific outputs and traditional knowledge addressing the community needs for increased coastal resilience, building on the work undertaken by OKEANO project. The toolbox should include knowledge and solutions for various aspects of coastal resilience, including measures to protect and restore coastal ecosystems as nature-based solutions. As part of the toolbox, the proposals should consider and, where needed, develop methods and tools that would allow the communities to anticipate the diverse impacts of adaptation actions and measures, including on their most vulnerable members, and thus to avoid climate maladaptation [7] risks. In this context, proposals should consider the gender dimension and other social categories [8] and their intersections in disaster preparedness and capacity-building. A dynamic system for regular updates and refinement of the toolbox should be designed, based on emerging research and feedback from communities. An ongoing collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and community representatives should be fostered to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the solutions included in the toolbox;\n- to improve the production, access, and use of the knowledge responding to local community needs, and to support and complement the activities of the living labs, proposals should develop an interface [9] enabling communities to choose a tailor-made mix of coastal resilience solutions uniquely responding to their needs, in a way that increases societal buy-in and acceptance of the solutions while avoiding maladaptation risks;\n- for the digital element of the interface, proposals should design an online platform connecting available coastal resilience knowledge and solutions with community needs in a user-friendly manner, and produce interoperable, tailor-made digital applications. Proposals should consider complementarities with other platforms that already exist, such as those of the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and Mission Adaptation to Climate Change. The platform should allow for easy integration with existing digital decision-making, mapping and planning tools, for instance, by offering API (Application Programming Interfaces) integration which enables the platform to connect with existing digital tools and systems, allowing for the seamless exchange of data and functionality between systems;\n- the toolbox and interface should be tested and piloted in living labs [10] based on a systematic user co-creation approach in real life communities and settings. Proposals should create the living labs in a diverse set of Atlantic communities, such as coastal cities, regions and islands (including small island developing states), from different parts of the Atlantic, and other relevant communities living at the intersection of marine, coastal and freshwater areas, with a particular attention to those that are highly vulnerable to the risks of climate change. These living labs could also serve as centres for knowledge dissemination, training, community engagement, and collaborative problem-solving. Using the results of relevant projects [11] , proposals should select appropriate participatory processes or develop new ones that would involve a broad range of stakeholders from the local communities where the toolbox and interface would be used;\n- To empower local coastal communities to make evidence-based decisions in response to environmental change within their territories, proposals should promote innovation and enhance human capacity through the establishment of learning spaces, knowledge exchange, training, participatory process of visioning and skills development, based on the contents of the toolbox. Attention should be given to securing the long-term sustainability of these activities.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, to ensure an adequate involvement of researchers and relevant stakeholders (e.g. regional and local authorities, citizens, youth, NGOs, local businesses, private investors, social innovators, etc) from the target communities. They should also integrate SSH disciplines, including gender studies and citizen social science where relevant.\nInternational cooperation is strongly encouraged, especially with AAORIA partner countries and other Atlantic countries.\nTo ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps, the proposals should foresee to work closely with relevant ongoing Horizon Europe projects, particularly the OKEANO project, and, where relevant, the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2025 01-CLIMA-03, and relevant projects of the Mission ‘Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030’ and its Atlantic and Arctic lighthouse (e.g. A-AAGORA and CLIMAREST), and the Mission Ocean Implementation Platform (MIP) [12] , notably on deployment and upscaling of solutions. Proposals should also consider results of other Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects such as TRIATLAS, the projects of the ADAPT4COAST cluster, ILIAD, DestinE, the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and other relevant projects, programmes, and initiatives, including from AAORIA partner countries and other countries around the Atlantic, as well as relevant work under the OSPAR convention [13] .\n[1] This encompasses coastal communities from all Atlantic countries, including those outside the EU, reflecting the pole-to-pole dimension of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance.\n[2] SKM_80822071310280 (allatlanticocean.org)\n[3] See of AAORIA 2023 Forum listing the two current priority areas of action of AAORIA\n[4] For this action, the definition of coastal resilience proposed by the European Marine Board position paper “Building Coastal Resilience in Europe” applies: the capacity of coastal natural and socio-economic systems to persist, adapt or transform when faced with disturbances induced by factors such as sea-level rise, extreme events and human impacts, whilst maintaining their essential functions (Folke, 2006; Masselink & Lazarus, 2019).\n[5] See partners at All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (allatlanticocean.org) .\n[6] For this action, the toolbox is intended as a repository of available knowledge, and practices aimed at enhancing coastal resilience; this could include case studies, examples of what has worked in various environments for various aspects of coastal resilience, methodology, description of technological solutions, etc outputs of existing research projects and initiatives.\n[7] Climate maladaptation has been highlighted in the sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC and refers to a situation when climate change adaptation actions backfire, further deepening existing social inequities and leading to adverse outcomes.\n[8] Such as disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic and/or cultural origins, sexual orientation, etc.\n[9] For this action, the interface is intended as a combination of digital means, participatory approaches and guidelines that would allow coastal communities to access the repository (toolbox) of coastal resilience related knowledge, and practices, and to select the right mix of solutions for their unique resilience needs.\n[10] What are Living Labs - European Network of Living Labs (enoll.org)\n[11] Such as those from the ADAPT4COAST project cluster and EmpowerUs project .\n[12] Mission Ocean, Seas and Waters Implementation Support Platform | Ecologic Institute\n[13] OSPAR Commission | Protecting and conserving the North-East Atlantic and its resources",

[1] The successful proposal will support the development of policies, business models and market conditions contributing to the sustainable and inclusive development of urban areas and to the empowerment and resilience of their communities, who can access, afford and choose sustainable food.\nProjects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- enhanced skills and problem-based learning to change food cultures, behaviours and food environments;\n- improved local governance frameworks for social inclusion and social economy in urban areas;\n- improved understanding of the local policy ‘mix’/package of measures as well as the effective communication and marketing strategies that are needed to support EU consumer behavioural change towards sustainable diets.",
      "scope": "Achieving sustainable food systems requires managing numerous interconnected activities and actors with an impact on nutrition, environmental and economic outcomes of great relevance to the EU, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Understanding food systems interconnections and interdependencies is crucial in decision making processes to steer a food system change. Yet, for governments to promote more sustainable food systems, they will need to improve their capacity to deal with the complexity of interdependencies with adequate governance mechanisms and principles to support a more systemic approach. Strengthening food systems governance in the urban context is an important area and opportunity for research, innovation and implementation to accelerate sustainability impact in the local context. It has the potential to enhance more coordination and coherent actions, leading to the development of more effective urban policies that ensure food security and nutrition for all without compromising economic, environmental, and social foundations.\nProposals are expected to address at least three of the following:\n- create innovative hands-on living labs and co-creation spaces that actively engage all parts of society to enhance skills and capacity building toward healthy, affordable and environment- and climate-friendly diets; and apply randomized controlled trials, for different age groups (especially young people and the elderly), socio-economic groups and their different needs;\n- promote and establish sustainable / regenerative community gardens and indoor and open field small-scale urban agriculture for skills building and network creation and share best practices from other areas/cities not covered by the proposals;\n- enhance participation of vulnerable groups, such as young people (including those not in education or employment), elderly people, migrants, homelessness people, ethnic minorities, pregnant women, and persons with disabilities, in living labs and community gardens to strengthen inclusion as well as intercultural and intergenerational cohesion;\n- enhance attractiveness of safe, healthy, environment-friendly food, for instance by making use of social media and partnering up with different actors (e.g., chefs, nutritionists and dieticians, food scientists and technologists, food industry, start-ups R&D, social/solidarity economy actors, etc.);\n- involve local and regional governance mechanisms to enable structural change, for instance by developing and implementing effective participatory and inclusive processes which enable and stimulate an extensive dialogue on food system transformation and involve diverse stakeholders (e.g., citizens, farmers, consumers, civil society organizations, research institutions, businesses, and public authorities at the local or regional levels);\n- connect different living labs and build networks, also from previous EU funded projects, for joint learning and best practice exchange;\n- establish data monitoring approaches (e.g. through using machine learning approach, AI, etc.) and a test-control approach for impact assessment and evidence-based policy making.\nProposals should include a dedicated task in the workplan and appropriate resources to collaborate with the projects funded under this topic and under topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-01 (Mobilisation of society to transform food systems for co-benefit, Cleverfood).\nCollaboration and complementarity with the European Partnerships on “Sustainable Food Systems”, “Agroecology”, the EU Missions “A Soil Deal for Europe” and “Climate-Neutral Smart Cities”, and the New European Bauhaus (NEB) Facility is encouraged.\nCooperation with the JRC may be envisaged, in particular for actions related to monitoring and improving the governance of food systems.\nProposals should integrate the gender dimension where applicable. Consideration of other social categories besides gender (disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic and/or cultural origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections, should be also ensured. The use of multi-actor approach is encouraged.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, cooperation with legal entities established in widening countries is strongly encouraged. International cooperation is also encouraged.\n[1] European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Bizzo, G., Fabbri, K., Gajdzinska, M. et al., Food 2030 – Pathways for action 2.0 – R&I policy as a driver for sustainable, healthy, climate resilient and inclusive food systems, Publications Office of the European Union, 2023, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/365011",

      "expected_outcome": "In line with the European Commission’s food security communication [1] , the successful proposals will support the reduction of the EU's import dependency on key agricultural products and inputs by boosting EU plant proteins production and use for feed while increasing the sustainability and resilience of Europe’s agricultural systems.\nSuccessful proposals should support the objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP), as well as the EU Green Deal strategies, the EU climate action [2] , and the communication on boosting biotechnology and biomanufacturing in the EU.\nSuccessful proposals will deliver on the expected impacts of the destination by enabling agri-food systems to contribute to EU strategic autonomy by fostering food and nutrition security and safeguarding long-term sustainability of EU farming systems.\nProjects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- farmers capacity to sustainably produce and use protein crops for feed in the EU is fostered;\n- farmers and advisors understanding about protein crops cultivation and share in animals’ diets is improved;\n- knowledge and innovation of the diverse actors across the protein crops value chain on preservation and transformation processes of protein crops for feed is increased;\n- contributions to move towards a more competitive EU protein crop sector are provided, rendering agricultural systems more resilient to climate change, external shocks and supply chain disruptions, while more committed to biodiversity preservation and conservation.",
      "scope": "Currently, protein crops [3] cultivation, such as grain legumes and fodder legumes, only accounts for a small proportion (around 3%) of the EU agricultural area. While there is little shortage in the protein supply for food purposes in the EU, there is a more important shortage in the feed sector [4] , resulting in high levels of imports (especially of soya) originating from countries often with different environmental and social standards. It is, therefore, strategical for the EU to expand the domestic production of protein crops, including in mixed crops [5] as a feed source.\nIncreasing the EU’ plant protein autonomy would allow for reducing imports of protein feed from third countries, and thereby, would contribute to the decrease of environmental and climate footprints. Additionally, promoting locally produced protein crops would contribute to the sustainable development of EU rural areas, in line with the EU long-term vision on rural areas, for example through the development of new regional value chains that are self-sustaining. Developments in this area should at the same time be coherent with the new Regulation on deforestation-free products [6] by reducing the impact of plant protein feed needs on deforestation and forest degradation globally.\nThe benefits of increasing the share of protein crops, in particular nitrogen-fixing leguminous crops, in EU farming systems, are also reflected in the climate and the environment, through the improvement of soil quality (restoring and enhancing biodiversity, increasing soil fertility, cycling nutrients, improving soil structure, increasing water retention capacity, etc.) which in turn improves the sustainability and resilience of farms.\nProposals should:\n- improve the knowledge about local production and utilization of various available protein crops used for animal feed across different regions;\n- identify gaps, needs, barriers and enablers for taking up and scaling up sustainable protein crops intended for feed use in the EU, from production to processing and trade levels. Draw up a strategic roadmap with research and innovation priorities based on the identified challenges, including for the optimization of manufacturing processes of locally produced plant protein into feed;\n- identify, test and showcase biodiversity-friendly management practices in farming systems (crop production and livestock raising) containing protein crops intended for feed use. Prioritise the use of climate and pest resilient protein crops adapted to different EU pedoclimatic conditions;\n- assess the social, economic and environmental impacts and trade-offs for up- and downstream actors of the feed value chain, of the increased share of different protein crops in different farming systems;\n- generate comprehensive capacity building material, trainings and information tools for farmers, advisors and extension services, including a visualization tailored to different geographical regions and pedoclimatic zones in the EU. Address the most cost-effective production systems with protein crops and combinations of crops, based on local agronomic features as well as on local market data such as demand for feed.\nAll farming approaches, including organic farming, are in the scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the main actors relevant for domestic plant protein feed value chain, such as farmers, other land managers, advisors, feed manufacturers, industry (including small and medium enterprises), policy-makers, etc. Proposals should ensure an effective knowledge, co-creation and exchange between researchers and field actors as well as with the whole feed value chain actors concerning the benefits, challenges and opportunities of producing and integrating local protein crops for feed in the EU. To this end, proposals should develop diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials presenting R&I solutions (e.g. audiovisuals, brochures, fact sheets, etc) and should share all generated data and knowledge through existing digital tools or platforms.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources, and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project funded under this topic and with relevant activities to be carried out under topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-5-two-stage [7] and HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-06 [8] . Proposals should ensure coherence and complementarity with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and with relevant activities of the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’. Likewise, proposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, such as those resulting from Horizon 2020 projects.\nThe possible participation of the JRC in the project could consist of support analysis, applying its tools such as the integrated agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP), for scenario assessment.\n[1] COM(2022) 133 final ( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0133 )\n[2] COM(2022) 133 final ( EUR-Lex - 52022DC0133 - EN - EUR-Lex )\n[3] In this topic, protein crops refer to crops with a high content of proteins which can be used for animal feed.\n[4] EC (2023), EU agricultural outlook for markets, 2023-2035\n[5] Cereals and grain legumes or grass and fodder legumes are examples of mixed crops used for feed (maize and beans, clover and ryegrass, barley and peas, etc).\n[6] Regulation - 2023/1115 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1115/oj\n[7] HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-5-two-stage: ‘Animal nutritional requirements and nutritional value of feed under different production management conditions', under wp-9-food-bioeconomy-natural-resources-agriculture-and-environment_horizon-2023-2024_en.pdf (europa.eu) .\n[8] HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-07: ‘Improving grassland management in European livestock farming systems’, under this work programme.",

Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also been implementing the partnership through two co-funded calls launched in year 2024 and several internal activities based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the partnership, the activities to be implemented in particular financial support to third parties and internal activities clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe proposal submitted to this call should align with the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda. Activities should reflect a balanced proportion of financial support to third parties and of internal activities, including calls for research projects, setting-up an EU-wide network of agroecology living labs and research infrastructures, development of indicators, metrics, and tools to monitor the agroecology transition and sustainability performance, and supporting evidence-based policy-making at EU, national and regional level. Through its activities, the partnership should deliver and support the upscaling of concrete, ready-to-use tools, solutions and innovations for farmers in different pedo-climatic conditions and contexts, and ensure a wide-spread uptake of partnership’s results by farmers and by all relevant stakeholders. These aspects should be reflected in the successive updates of the partnership’s strategic research and innovation agenda.\nThe partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to organising and implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties, for which it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects.\nThe partnership should seek to include additional partners, including from Member States and Associated countries not yet in the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1. Through its activities, and by remaining open to accepting new partners, the partnership should devote efforts to promote agroecological farming also in countries where there is still limited understanding and uptake of the concept. Likewise, in setting up and building an EU-wide network of agroecology living labs, the partnership should ensure a balanced representation of pedo-climatic conditions and bio-geographical regions, with a view to cover a wide range of farming systems that are representative of the European agricultural sector. The partnership should cover issues pertaining to the agroecology transition in all agricultural production systems and approaches, including but not limited to conventional and organic farming. This will among others contribute to supporting the development of the organic farming sector and increasing its sustainability, as well as to ensuring a widespread adoption of agroecological practices across sectors across Europe.\nSpecific activities to strengthen the complementarities of the European partnership for accelerating farming systems transition - agroecology living labs and research infrastructures, with the related Horizon Europe Missions and Partnerships, identified in the proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1, as well as activities to enhance the partnership’s collaborations at international level, should also be described.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1 and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and any additional partners, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.",

They will also empower farmers and key actors in the agricultural sector to manage sustainable, efficient, profitable, and circular farming systems with low greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate-neutrality and resilience.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- the understanding of drivers of plant pest emergence, including the influence of climate change, ecosystem degradation and globalisation, is increased;\n- cost-effective preventive and/or curative measures to new and/or emerging plant pests are developed;\n- economic, social, and environmentally sound solutions for effective pest management in farming and/or forestry in line with the principles of integrated pest management are developed;\n- scientific support, recommendations, and policy advice are provided to strengthen plant health policies.",
      "scope": "Plant health is crucial for agriculture, forestry, ecosystems, ecosystem services and biodiversity on a global scale. The current EU plant health legislative framework plays a vital role in protecting the EU from the introduction of new plant pests and as well as tackling existing plant pests more effectively. Maintaining healthy crops is increasingly challenging due to factors like climate change, biodiversity loss, globalisation, and international trade which accelerate the spread of pests and diseases. These threats can severely damage crops, native plants, and the environment, jeopardising agricultural sustainability, biodiversity, and food security.\nTo address these issues, proposals should target one or more new or emerging plant pests [2] (regulated, non-regulated, introduced or native) that are causing or likely to cause, significant socio-economic and/or environmental impact to agriculture and/or forestry in the EU and/or Associated Countries, well as the impact on trade and the wider environment, including soil and water, considering potential exacerbation under climate change [3] . Within the scope of this topic are pests exhibiting an altered and higher probability of entry, establishment and spread in a new area that might be the result of changes in their biology or changes in agriculture or forestry pest management practice or rapid spread in new areas.\nProposals should:\n- enhance understanding of pest(s) biology, introduction pathways, interaction with crop-soil ecosystems (if relevant), and mechanisms of spread, especially considering the challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity crisis, land use, and globalisation, thereby reducing uncertainties and lack of data in pest risk assessments;\n- develop rapid and cost-effective tools and methods for preventing pest(s) entry, spread, and establishment; this includes early detection, surveillance, treatment [4] , and (bio)control measures (including innovative agro-ecological practices), in line with sustainable and integrated pest management;\n- assess the social, economic, and environmental impacts of plant pest(s) establishment and spread on farmers and/or forest owners and develop strategies to mitigate these impacts effectively;\n- contribute to the identification of resistant and/or tolerant traits and explore agro-ecological processes as tools for pests regulation, enhancing the resilience and long-term sustainability of the sector;\n- foster a holistic understanding and management of plant pests following a One Health approach, recognising the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment.\nInternational cooperation with countries affected or threatened by the same pest(s) is strongly encouraged.\nProposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, plant health services, farming/forestry sectors, advisory services, and industry are brought together.\nResults should benefit diverse farming systems/approaches, including conventional and organic farming.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate tools and methods for early detection, surveillance, treatment, and (bio)control measures. A maximum of 10% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures and accredited laboratories [5] .\nProposals should ensure coherence and complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects.\nThe proposals should include a dedicated task in the workplan and appropriate resources to collaborate with the projects funded under this topic.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/2031/oj\n[2] A pest is defined here as any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products (EU legislation, Regulation 2016/2031).\n[3] Applicants are expected to explain and justify the choice of pest(s) in alignment with the proposal’s objectives and the topic’s expected outcomes.\n[4] See IPPC Secretariat. 2024.

      "scope": "Under this topic, proposals should test, develop and pilot innovative solutions to support farmers to improve their position in the value chains, profit from leveraging the use of their agricultural produce and improve financial viabilities. Proposals should improve the climate and environmental performance of the resulting farmer’s activities and businesses. Proposals should also foster new SME-led sustainable business models and increase the opportunities for farmers to benefit from on-farm transformation and/or storage of agricultural outputs for food and/or non-food purposes. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon 2020 Calls ‘Healthy and safe foods and diets for all’ 2016-2017 or/and ‘Empowerment of rural areas, support to policies and rural innovation’ 2018-2020 or/and Horizon Europe calls “Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption” 2021-2022 and 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nInnovations proposed should have a positive impact on environment as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. Proposals should demonstrate practical applicability and be tailored to the needs of farmers and adapted to the seasonal character of raw material production.\nSuccessful proposals should assess the impact of the proposed innovations on the overall sustainability (environmental, social, economic) of the farmers and business activities. The climate change mitigation and carbon footprint reduction potential of the proposed innovations should be analysed. Successful proposals should address the requirements from relevant EU regulatory frameworks, including where relevant needs for pre-market authorisation.\nProposals should perform economic cost-benefit analysis of the practical implementation of the innovations developed within the project. Proposals should describe an exploitation pathway tailor-made for the developed innovations through the different necessary steps (e.g. market research, manufacturing, regulatory approvals and licensing, IP management etc.) in order to accelerate exploitation of the results.\nProposed activities must apply the concept of the 'multi-actor approach' and allow for adequate involvement of relevant actors including farmers and SMEs. Proposals should benefit various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming. Proposals should develop publicly available diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, e.g., audiovisual materials, brochures, presenting the innovations.\nSME participation is expected. Proposals may involve financial support to third parties, particularly for farmers and/or SMEs providing and/or developing, testing, or validating the proposed innovative technologies/solutions. A maximum 30% of EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of third parties, for which financial support may be granted.",

      "scope": "According to the European Environmental Agency (EEA), water stress affects 30% of the EU population with an economic damage of up to EUR 9 billion annually. Droughts are increasing in frequency, magnitude and impact, and the affected area is expanding. Agriculture is the main water user in some Member States and Associated Countries.\nAlternative water sources and storage systems (e.g., rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) limit abstractions from surface waters and groundwater reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture and food systems, and provide a reliable water source for irrigation and other uses, strengthening its resilience. Some barriers still hinder a broader use of alternative water sources. For example, a lack of knowledge from farmers on the benefits and characteristics of other water supplies, financial models considering production and transport costs, seasonal variations of water quality with nutrient imbalances and salinity, heavy metals or emerging contaminants issues, or long-term impacts.\nProposals should:\n- test different strategies and technologies for irrigation or for other agricultural purposes (including drinking water for livestock), using alternative water sources (considering the most feasible sources according to the specific conditions of availability, climate, soil, socio-economics, environment) in the long-term in real-life contexts across the EU and Associated Countries (where relevant) at a larger scale beyond small experimental sites, covering the whole water cycle in agriculture;\n- identify and test different business models regarding financial viability and long-term economic sustainability (including cost-benefit analysis or agro-economic modelling) for the adoption of alternative water sources, considering different scenarios, pedo-climatic conditions and socio-economic contexts;\n- evaluate the long-term impact of the use of alternative water sources on soil health, including the soil microbiome, crop productivity and quality, food and feed safety (especially for fresh-consumed products) and on freshwater resources and ecosystems (surface and groundwater), considering seasonal variations of water source quality (including persistent chemicals and microplastics’ releases) and quantity, such as situations of extreme water scarcity;\n- test and document cost-efficient methodologies and techniques to monitor most relevant quality and quantity parameters in real-time and/or to remove contaminants (e.g. using bio-filters) for a safe and efficient management of water from different sources, with particular attention to emerging contaminants especially in reclaimed water;\n- identify societal, behavioural and regulatory challenges still hampering upscaling of alternative water sources’ uptake for irrigation and development of suitable solutions to increase the uptake in practice;\n- develop, test and make recommendations for improved and targeted incentives and policies at regional, national and European level to reduce financial, social and economic barriers for adoption and acceptance of circular water management in agriculture by farmers and consumers;\n- enhance the dissemination of existing knowledge, by connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up adoption of solutions by practitioners, and by providing training and advice for farmers and demonstration activities. Complementarities with European and national AKIS knowledge channels or similar should be explored.\nProposals should benefit various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming.\nApplicants should apply the most efficient, state of the art agricultural practices and technologies (including irrigation, soil and crop management, etc.) to ensure maximum impact.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines, especially in the field of societal and behavioural sciences, and of adoption and acceptance processes.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach (MAA), involving at least scientists, companies working in the field of water management and agriculture, farmers and consumers, in order to co-create the knowledge and adapted solutions, and enhance the adoption process.\nProposals should include dissemination activities to increase awareness about the potential value for farmers, advisors and society at large and people of the results. In that sense, proposals should develop diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, e.g., audiovisual materials, brochures, etc. presenting the R&I solutions, while exploring the use of relevant support services offered by the Commission, such as the Horizon Results Booster.\nProposals should ensure complementarities with other relevant activities carried out under Horizon Europe, including with the European Partnership on Agriculture of Data.\nRegarding activities involving aquifer recharging, proposals should take into consideration guidelines provided by the Working Group Groundwater (one of the several groups under the umbrella of the Common Implementation Strategy for the Water Framework Directive), such as provided in the Guidance Document on Managed Aquifer Recharge under the Water Framework Directive.\nApplicants are encouraged to tap into international expertise (particularly from Africa and the Mediterranean Area) where relevant. Complementarities with the PRIMA and Water4All partnerships should be explored.\nThe JRC could participate in this topic, applying its tools to support analysis, such as its integrated agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP) for scenario assessments, or specific water-related models.",

This topic is also in line with the overall challenges highlighted in the updated Food 2030 pathways for action 2.0 report, particularly on the food safety systems of the future pathway, this report was published in December 2023 by the European Commission.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- a new level of ambition and creativity is implemented to tackle innovation creation, enhancing the deployment of solutions in the field of food safety and/or food fraud using existing knowledge, available technologies (such as molecular methods, genomic strategies, photonics, biotechnology, etc.) and the results achieved by European framework programmes projects. The EU’s strong knowledge base is translated into marketable results addressing the “innovation paradox” (i.e. the fact that knowledge does not always translate to marketable products and services);\n- food systems become more resilient to food safety risks through the use and exploitation of available knowledge and technologies;\n- increased food chain and food systems competitiveness creating close to the market impactful applications that will benefit and connect solutions for food systems actors (i.e., farming, raw materials and ingredients suppliers, food industry, etc.);\n- increased complementarities and results uptake in the field of food safety and/or food fraud with past and existing European framework programmes projects, and synergies with programmes and their associated project results from the European Research Council (ERC) and the European Innovation Council (EIC);\n- contribute to EU climate action: deployment of clean technologies in the food industry, to boost food manufacturing efficiency and reduce carbon footprint.",
      "scope": "Proposals should contribute to all of the following aspects:\n- in the areas of food safety and food fraud a lot of efforts have been invested in European framework programme projects generating knowledge and potential applications. Proposals should contribute to further develop existing knowledge and technological results in the areas to reach higher TRLs aligned with user’s needs and estimating the potential impact on cost for the consumers;\n- support innovation to foster advances along the food system implementing digital and technological solutions in high TRL´s covering existing food safety and/or food fraud gaps. Proposals should develop and implement innovative solutions close to the market. This should be based on an initial food chain needs and technology gap analysis in the area of food safety hazards (including climate-related ones when applicable) and/or food fraud justifying the followed decision-making process. When selecting the food safety and/or food fraud technologies the most innovative clean technologies should be favoured in scenarios of equal conditions to reduce GHG emissions. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for commercialisation and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used;\n- identify existing regulations and give recommendations about which technologies could use sandboxes to foster future commercialisation;\nActivities are expected to achieve TRL 8 by the end of the project. Proposals should clearly define the TRL starting point for each involved technology and the plan to reach more advanced TRL.\nApplicants should seek complementarities and leverage on the results of past and ongoing research and innovation projects (including projects under the same topic) in the areas of food safety and/or food fraud (i.e. HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-12, HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-3, HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-4 among others). Therefore, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources, and a plan on how they should collaborate with other ongoing projects under this theme. In the case of already finished projects applicants will define the best way to engage relevant stakeholders of such projects and the cooperation agreements (also in terms of technology transfer and intellectual property) that are needed.\nGovernmental and food safety regulatory authorities (i.e. EFSA) should, alongside with other stakeholders (startups, SMEs, investors, etc.) be involved. The multi-actor approach applies to this topic.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as METROFOOD-RI (the infrastructure for promoting metrology in food and nutrition) or other relevant research infrastructures.\nProposals are also encouraged to consider citizens and societal engagement in their activities for the implementation of technological results better aligned with consumer’s needs.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.",

      "scope": "Currently, protein crops [3] cultivation, such as grain legumes and fodder legumes, only accounts for a small proportion (around 3%) of the EU agricultural area. While there is little shortage in the protein supply for food purposes in the EU, there is a more important shortage in the feed sector [4] , resulting in high levels of imports (especially of soya) originating from countries often with different environmental and social standards. It is, therefore, strategical for the EU to expand the domestic production of protein crops, including in mixed crops [5] as a feed source.\nIncreasing the EU’ plant protein autonomy would allow for reducing imports of protein feed from third countries, and thereby, would contribute to the decrease of environmental and climate footprints. Additionally, promoting locally produced protein crops would contribute to the sustainable development of EU rural areas, in line with the EU long-term vision on rural areas, for example through the development of new regional value chains that are self-sustaining. Developments in this area should at the same time be coherent with the new Regulation on deforestation-free products [6] by reducing the impact of plant protein feed needs on deforestation and forest degradation globally.\nThe benefits of increasing the share of protein crops, in particular nitrogen-fixing leguminous crops, in EU farming systems, are also reflected in the climate and the environment, through the improvement of soil quality (restoring and enhancing biodiversity, increasing soil fertility, cycling nutrients, improving soil structure, increasing water retention capacity, etc.) which in turn improves the sustainability and resilience of farms.\nProposals should:\n- improve the knowledge about local production and utilization of various available protein crops used for animal feed across different regions;\n- identify gaps, needs, barriers and enablers for taking up and scaling up sustainable protein crops intended for feed use in the EU, from production to processing and trade levels. Draw up a strategic roadmap with research and innovation priorities based on the identified challenges, including for the optimization of manufacturing processes of locally produced plant protein into feed;\n- identify, test and showcase biodiversity-friendly management practices in farming systems (crop production and livestock raising) containing protein crops intended for feed use. Prioritise the use of climate and pest resilient protein crops adapted to different EU pedoclimatic conditions;\n- assess the social, economic and environmental impacts and trade-offs for up- and downstream actors of the feed value chain, of the increased share of different protein crops in different farming systems;\n- generate comprehensive capacity building material, trainings and information tools for farmers, advisors and extension services, including a visualization tailored to different geographical regions and pedoclimatic zones in the EU. Address the most cost-effective production systems with protein crops and combinations of crops, based on local agronomic features as well as on local market data such as demand for feed.\nAll farming approaches, including organic farming, are in the scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the main actors relevant for domestic plant protein feed value chain, such as farmers, other land managers, advisors, feed manufacturers, industry (including small and medium enterprises), policy-makers, etc. Proposals should ensure an effective knowledge, co-creation and exchange between researchers and field actors as well as with the whole feed value chain actors concerning the benefits, challenges and opportunities of producing and integrating local protein crops for feed in the EU. To this end, proposals should develop diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials presenting R&I solutions (e.g. audiovisuals, brochures, fact sheets, etc) and should share all generated data and knowledge through existing digital tools or platforms.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources, and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project funded under this topic and with relevant activities to be carried out under topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-5-two-stage [7] and HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-06 [8] . Proposals should ensure coherence and complementarity with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and with relevant activities of the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’. Likewise, proposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, such as those resulting from Horizon 2020 projects.\nThe possible participation of the JRC in the project could consist of support analysis, applying its tools such as the integrated agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP), for scenario assessment.\n[1] COM(2022) 133 final ( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0133 )\n[2] COM(2022) 133 final ( EUR-Lex - 52022DC0133 - EN - EUR-Lex )\n[3] In this topic, protein crops refer to crops with a high content of proteins which can be used for animal feed.\n[4] EC (2023), EU agricultural outlook for markets, 2023-2035\n[5] Cereals and grain legumes or grass and fodder legumes are examples of mixed crops used for feed (maize and beans, clover and ryegrass, barley and peas, etc).\n[6] Regulation - 2023/1115 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1115/oj\n[7] HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-5-two-stage: ‘Animal nutritional requirements and nutritional value of feed under different production management conditions', under wp-9-food-bioeconomy-natural-resources-agriculture-and-environment_horizon-2023-2024_en.pdf (europa.eu) .\n[8] HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-07: ‘Improving grassland management in European livestock farming systems’, under this work programme.",

Actions will also be in line with the overall challenges highlighted in the updated Food 2030 pathways for action report published in December 2023 [1] on food waste and resource efficient food systems.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- successful implementation of the harmonisation of food waste measurement across Europe, supported by the development of new tools, and testing of existing ones, producing reliable and comparable data on food and waste at household level;\n- alleviate the burden of reporting of household food waste data for Member States, by making use of technological innovations;\n- understand the underlying causes of food waste at household level to help policymakers and stakeholders develop more efficient interventions;\n- contribute to Members States’ reporting on their national food waste levels, in line with targets set by the Waste Framework Directive revision, with positive impacts on the reduction of food waste at household level, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pressure on natural resources.",
      "scope": "In the EU, over 59 million tonnes of food waste (132 kg/inhabitant) are generated annually [2] , with an associated market value estimated at 132 billion euros.\nEurostat roughly estimates that around 10% of food made available to EU consumers (at retail, food services and households) may be wasted. At the same time, in 2023, 9.5% of the EU population could not afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day [3] . In the EU, households generate more than half of the total food waste (54%).\nWasting food is not only an ethical and economic issue but it also depletes the environment of limited natural resources. Food waste has a huge environmental impact, accounting for about 16% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the EU food system. Therefore, by reducing food waste we can also support the fight against climate change.\nProposals should contribute to all of the following aspects:\n- develop and validate new tools and methods, and/or further test existing methods (including those developed by previous EU-funded projects), to measure and estimate food waste at household level, including the food waste discarded as or with wastewaters and that would help distinguish between amounts of avoidable (edible) fraction of food waste and non-avoidable (inedible) food waste. The potential of AI and other technologies (including ones that are currently available) to simplify the collection of data and the reporting (by being integrated in advanced monitoring solutions) should be considered. Interoperable metadata standards accompanying indicators coming from these new tools and methods should be provided. The metadata standards for edible and inedible food waste indicators should allow data to be federated through the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) infrastructure;\n- these new tools and methods should be applied across a large enough sample of diverse type of products and target groups (in terms of gender, age, socio-economic status, ethnic and/or cultural origins, etc.), allowing for a more precise assessment of food waste fractions (edible and inedible), across several years and in a significant number of Member States, and potentially in Associated Countries. This should generate robust measurement/estimation of food waste at household level for different target groups, at national level. The potential for extensive uptake of the proposed solution should be clearly highlighted;\n- in addition to measurement, the direct and indirect drivers and root causes of food waste at household level should be thoroughly investigated. Particular attention should be paid to the identification of consumer behaviours (food consumption and disposal patterns) and other factors that influence food waste at household level, to assess the potential for a reduction strategy based on change in consumer behaviours.\nIn addition, proposals could explore eco-friendly, low-input and efficient technological solutions to prevent edible food from being discarded in households, e.g. by preventing product degradation.\nThe required multi-actor approach must be implemented by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide diversity of food system actors, with special attention paid to consumers and civil society organisations.\nProposals are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research (in particular, the EU-funded CHORIZO and WASTELESS projects, expected to be finalised in 2025) and on the work carried out by the European Consumer Food Waste Forum [4] , and create synergies with relevant initiatives including the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. Citizen science is encouraged at all stages of the research activities for this topic and should be integrated in the research methodology. Proposals should take into account and address inequalities (e.g. by addressing the risk of AI bias in terms of gender, disability, ethnicity, etc.).\n[1] European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Bizzo, G., Fabbri, K., Gajdzinska, M. et al., Food 2030 – Pathways for action 2.0 – R&I policy as a driver for sustainable, healthy, climate resilient and inclusive food systems , Publications Office of the European Union, 2023, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/365011\n[2] Eurostat (2024), Food waste and food waste prevention – estimates , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Food_waste_and_food_waste_prevention_-_estimates\n[3] Eurostat (2024), Inability to afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish (or vegetarian equivalent) every second day , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ilc_mdes03/default/table?lang=en\n[4] https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/projects-activities/european-consumer-food-waste-forum_en",

      "scope": "Plant health is critical for agriculture, forestry, ecosystems, and biodiversity on a global scale. However, maintaining healthy crops is becoming increasingly challenging due to climate change, biodiversity loss, globalisation, and international trade, which accelerate the spread of pests and diseases. These threats can severely harm crops, native plants, and the environment, jeopardising agricultural sustainability, biodiversity, and food security.\nEffective plant health measures play a vital role in protecting sustainable agriculture and enhancing global food security, safeguarding the environment, forests, and biodiversity, and facilitating economic and trade development. A systems approach to plant health is a comprehensive pest risk management strategy that integrates different measures, at least two of which act independently, with cumulative effect and of high efficacy[[ International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 14. The use of integrated measures in a systems approach for pest risk management [ https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/607 ]]. The systems approach is designed to effectively meet phytosanitary import requirements, allowing for the consideration of measures and procedures that contribute to effective pest risk management throughout the entire value chain, from pre-planting and pre-harvest stages to harvest, post-harvest handling, transport, and distribution. By integrating multiple measures, this approach enhances the ability to manage pest risks comprehensively and sustainably, ensuring the health of plants and the safety of agricultural products across borders. Proposals should target one or more plant pests [2] , providing a clear explanation and justification for the selected pest(s) in alignment with the proposal’s objectives and the topic’s expected outcomes.\nProposals should:\n- develop innovative climate and environmental-friendly measures for a highly efficacious pest risk management to be implemented across the value chain to meet the phytosanitary requirements in a variety of socio-economic contexts;\n- evaluate risk reduction, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability, of each proposed innovative measures;\n- design and validate protocols targeting systems approaches, considering the whole value chain;\n- assess the combined effect of all measures and their interactions across the value chain, including cost-effectiveness, scalability, and overall sustainability (economic, social and environmental aspects);\n- support capacity building and training of the actors within the value chain, enabling the large-scale adoption of safe, innovative, cost-effective measures.\nInternational cooperation is strongly encouraged. Results should benefit diverse farming systems/approaches, such as conventional and organic farming.\nProposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, plant health services, farming/forestry sectors, advisory services, and other relevant actors of the value chain are brought together. This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate innovative measures. A maximum of 10% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted.\nThe possible participation of the JRC in the project could involve supporting the analysis to understand the acceptance and adoption of innovative measures across the value chain.\nProposals should ensure coherence and complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects.\nThe proposals should include a dedicated task in the workplan and appropriate resources to collaborate with the projects funded under this topic.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R2031\n[2] A pest is defined here as any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products (EU legislation, Regulation 2016/2031)",

Projects will therefore contribute to the expected impacts of this Destination by developing innovative tools and approaches to improve the resilience, adaptation to climate change and sustainability of agriculture and food systems in Africa.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- the availability, accessibility and adoption by farmers, advisors and policymakers of fair and inclusive approaches and strategies that improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in Africa, while addressing climate challenges is accelerated, optimising the use of ecological processes with co-benefits for biodiversity;\n- the coordination and experience sharing among researchers and agricultural actors in Africa is strengthened, in view of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and in line with the FNSSA roadmap [1] ;\n- agri-food stakeholders benefit from enhanced climatic, environmental and socio-economic performance of African agroecological farming practices.",
      "scope": "Agroecology is a holistic approach that relies on and optimises the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production. By working more with nature and ecosystem services, it has the potential to increase farms’ circularity, diversification and autonomy, address climate challenges while preserving and enhancing biodiversity, and drive a full transformation of farming systems and agricultural value chains, from input substitution and beyond. Agroecological farming systems therefore have great potential to enhance the sustainability performance of agriculture and agricultural value chains that contribute to the objectives of the EU Green deal for agriculture and to the FNSSA partnership.\nLiving labs under this topic are intended as open innovation ecosystems in real-life sites using iterative feedback processes throughout a lifecycle approach of an innovation to create inclusive and sustainable impact.\nWhile living labs are collaborative initiatives to co-create knowledge and innovations, lighthouses are sites for demonstration of exemplary and replicable solutions, training, peer-to-peer learning, and communications related to promoting agroecological approaches.\nProposals should:\n- set up living labs and light houses as places for testing and demonstrating agroecological approaches in different pedoclimatic conditions in Africa;\n- carry out participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation activities in living labs with agricultural actors (e.g. researchers, farmers, advisors, policymakers), including on socio-economic aspects to support sustainability transitions and upscaling, to seek practical agroecological solutions to the climatic and biodiversity challenges/opportunities identified;\n- identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on agroecology and that may be converted into lighthouses;\n- strengthen interactions between existing living and new labs, light houses and like-minded arrangements on agroecology to share lessons and facilitate science policy interfaces using where relevant existing network arrangements, such as those under the Horizon Europe CEA-First project.\nProposals should contribute to the implementation of the short- and medium-term actions of the joint AU-EU Innovation Agenda, particularly in the area of Green (notably actions (4) and (5) among short-term actions and (1) and (3) for medium-term actions), and aim to translate R&I efforts into tangible business, products, services, development and quality employment opportunities and social economy enterprises in Africa and Europe. Proposals should be in line with the conclusions of the 2023 AU-EU Agriculture Ministerial Conference [2] and support the African Free Trade Area.\nProposals should contribute to the implementation of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) adopted R&I roadmaps [3] pertaining to climate change, particularly in the areas impact of water scarcity and drought in rural areas, sustainable agriculture production and biodiversity in changing climate.\nProposals should build on the experience gained with relevant former and on-going FNSSA projects on agroecological approaches under Horizon 2020 and the Horizon Europe Work Programmes, as well as with activities of the DeSIRA [4] initiative part of the EU International Partnerships. At the same time, proposals should create synergies with any relevant activities carried out under the European Partnership “Agroecology” (’Accelerating farming systems transition – agroecology living labs and research infrastructures') and targeted EU-Africa cooperation activities under the EU Mission “A soil deal for Europe”. Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to create those synergies. To leverage opportunities for furthering impact and outreach, proposals should create synergies with the project resulting from the call “HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-16: Developing a joint AU-EU Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS) supporting the Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA) partnership”.\nProposals should adopt an inclusive approach that respects and integrates local knowledge and practices alongside technological and scientific expertise, where indigenous insights are enriched by innovative approaches and new technologies through mutual learning.\nProposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ to ensure the adequate involvement of the farming sector, civils society and relevant policy actors.\nParticipation of Mediterranean countries other than from EU and AU is encouraged.\nThe possible contribution of the JRC could involve exploring possible pathways for a sustainable transition of agriculture and food systems, defining scenarios for the agro-ecological transition, assessing the impacts of such transition, engaging with stakeholders, disseminating results notably to policymakers and through cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Global Food and Nutrition Security.\nProposals should ensure that gender dimension and social categories (e.g. disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic and/or cultural origins, sexual orientation) and their intersections, are duly considered.\nProposals may involve financial support to third parties to researchers, farmers, advisors and other multidisciplinary actors contributing to the setting up of living labs and/or lighthouses. A maximum 30% of EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. The provision of training (including technical guidelines and ad-hoc materials) and support services to farmers may be considered as a criterion to grant financial support to third parties.\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-food-and-nutrition-security-and-sustainable-agriculture-fnssa_en\n[2] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/events/5th-african-union-au-european-union-eu-agriculture-ministerial-conference-2023-06-30_en\n[3] https://ufmsecretariat.org/ministerial-conference-research-innovation-2022/\n[4] https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/programming/programmes/desira-development-smart-innovation-through-research-agriculture_en",

      "scope": "Well managed grasslands are key for the sustainability of the EU’s and Associated Countries agriculture and for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, including water purification, erosion and flood prevention, carbon sequestration and food production, and for preserving biodiversity. Grasslands can also play an important role as protein crop supply for feed. They constitute key elements of European socio-cultural landscapes. However, grasslands maintenance and functions in the EU are under threat for reasons that may include sub-optimal input management, intensification, farm concentration, climate change and abandonment.\nEnsuring the sustainable management of grasslands and preventing their disappearance is essential for a sustainable farming sector, for healthy nature, and for human wellbeing in the EU and Associated Countries. This calls for increasing scientific evidence on grasslands across Europe, including on their performance, benefits and trade-offs (e.g., climate, environment, biodiversity, socio-economic). There is also a need to further develop and demonstrate approaches that allow assessing the climate change adaptation and mitigation potential of grazing livestock systems, along with other benefits they can deliver. Moreover, farmers need new knowledge, innovative solutions, support and advice to sustainably maintain grasslands, and to restore degraded grassland habitats.\nIn this context, the role of and coherence among policies is crucial. Research and Innovation have a key role to play in demonstrating that properly managed grasslands systems are viable options for farmers.\nThis topic focuses on grazing livestock systems and involves both permanent grasslands, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 [1] , and temporary grasslands, understood as arable land with grasses, or grass mixtures with other species, that has been included in the crop rotation before reaching the five years that are necessary to be considered as permanent grassland.\nProposals should address all the following activities and should cover various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming:\n- develop and operationalise methodologies to measure, monitor, benchmark and assess the performance of grassland farming systems in different contexts in terms of the delivery of ecosystem services (e.g., productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, resilience to climate change, soil health, forage value), biodiversity restoration, reducing emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutants, and social aspects such as profitability for farmers and co-benefits for other stakeholders. This should include analysis of synergies and trade-offs between the above elements in the short- to medium- and long-terms. The benchmark of the performance of grassland farming systems should also include comparison between different levels of grass-based ruminants’ farming systems in similar pedo-climatic contexts;\n- develop new knowledge, innovative solutions/practices, and manageable strategies for creating, maintaining and restoring grasslands systems that are productive, cost-effective, sustainable, environmentally sound, and resilient to a changing climate. These strategies should include assessment of innovations in the social, environmental and economic domains, such as market uptake by value chain actors and consumers through, for instance, standards and labelling;\n- develop farm- and landscape level decision tools and strategies to support farmers in managing grasslands sustainably, to improve forage productivity and quality and livestock production, and the delivery of other ecosystem services, based on documented cases or in-situ demonstrators;\n- organise activities to mobilise the sharing of knowledge (scientific, practical and traditional), and networking among relevant actors. Proposals should develop practice-oriented dissemination materials, e.g. audiovisual materials, brochures, etc., presenting solutions, and make them publicly available;\n- assess relevant public policies at various levels and provide policy recommendations to improve their impact and coherence in supporting sustainable grassland systems;\n- perform economic cost-benefit analysis of applying the R&I solutions developed during the project and explore the potential of financing or incentive tools specific to the sustainable management of grassland farming systems, including lower-polluting and lower-GHG-emitting grazing livestock systems, and where relevant, restoration of degraded grasslands habitats.\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in grassland management in Europe, e.g., farmers (including farmers managing protected grassland habitats), shepherds and related organisations notably in the ruminants’ sectors, advisors, policy-makers, landscape and territorial planners, industry including small and medium enterprises, social economy actors, consumers, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations, etc.\nProposals should capitalise on research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects. Proposals should cover a variety of grasslands systems in different pedo-climatic conditions and biogeographical regions across the EU and consider marginal areas at risk of abandonment or with other constraints, and areas in intensification trends towards arable crop farming. Activities should allow for the comparison of performance and sustainability between grasslands systems presenting mixtures of plant species, including legumes, compared to mono-species grasslands. The possible contribution of the JRC could involve connecting with spatial datasets on livestock grazing density and grassland management intensity available in its portfolio. Furthermore, Eurostat [2] related data should also be considered.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic. Proposals should, where relevant, consider the use of Earth Observation data. Proposals should ensure complementarities with other relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including those funded under the topics HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-04, HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-04, as well as with relevant activities of the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ and other relevant future Horizon Europe Partnerships and R&I projects.\nIn order to enhance the societal and long-term impact of the activities beyond the life cycle of the project, proposals should apply social innovation and citizen engagement and include a strong involvement of citizens/civil society, together with academia/research, industry/SMEs/start-ups and government/public authorities.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. To achieve the objectives of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/2115/oj\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/experimental-statistics/geospatial-data-agricultural-census",

Prioritising diversification, resilience, and ecological approaches—including organic farming—will strengthen sustainable farming systems and boost the overall resilience of agriculture.\nSupport for smart, future-oriented plant breeding programs that prioritise traits enhancing crop resilience, sustainability, and adaptability, is a key objective for the coming years, aimed at strengthening food security. To achieve these goals, it is essential to ensure that companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the breeding sector, have access to cutting-edge scientific expertise, modern breeding technologies, and a highly skilled workforce. This will drive innovation and ensure that the latest advances benefit both farmers and the entire breeding community. Additionally, market access process for new varieties, including variety testing and registration, are critical in realising these benefits, and the research and development needs in relation to prioritised traits and values for cultivation should be identified.\nBetter coordination of research activities is crucial to overcome the current fragmentation of public and private research efforts. Strengthening collaboration across international, regional, and national levels will help integrate the needs of farmers, breeders, researchers, industry stakeholders, and society at large.

There is also preference for fish farming that relies on feed ingredients low in fish meal and oil and/or produced in the region where the farm is situated or in neighbouring to the farm regions, as well as feed ingredients derived from circular practices, such as, the use of wastes or by-products.\nAspects of sustainability, including circularity and zero waste, in particular in relation to the achievement of good environmental status, should also be addressed following a life cycle approach and potentially applying Environmental Footprint methods as described in Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279. Issues of fair pricing as well as regional particularities should also be addressed. Research could include aspects of feeding, breeding but also health and welfare issues as well as economic issues and issues of consumers’ acceptance. Regulatory aspects and legal barriers regarding the approval of novel feed ingredients or the licencing of new aquaculture farms should also be considered. Collaboration with European research infrastructures such as EMBRC ERIC and with accredited laboratories is encouraged.\nProposals should take into account, when applicable, the work done under the DIVERSIFY [2] FP7 project, the Horizon 2020 AquaVitae and ASTRAL projects as well as the IMPRESS, NOVAFOODIES, INNOAQUA, ULTFARMS, OLAMUR, AlgaePro BANOS, LOCALITY, VeriFish, Mr.Goodfish3.0 and EUAqua.Org Horizon Europe projects and relevant national and regional projects.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. International cooperation is encouraged for win-win outcomes and mutual benefits.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\n[2] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/603121",

      "expected_outcome": "In line with the common fisheries policy and in particular the Data Collection Framework (DCF) [1] , the revised Control Regulation [2] , the farm to fork strategy goals, the food 2030 R&I policy framework, the EU biodiversity strategy and in particular its target 15, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the EU action plan on protecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries, successful proposals will contribute to the impact of this Destination on sustainable fisheries and aquaculture.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- improve data collection (including position and catch data) for small scale fisheries (SSF) [3] , recreational fisheries [4] and long-distance fisheries, i.e. EU fleets operating beyond EU waters [5] , while reducing the costs of data collection and analysis;\n- improve efficiency, save costs, and advance fisheries monitoring, surveillance, control and enforcement technologies to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) practices in SSF, recreational fisheries and long-distance fisheries;\n- provide effective and, where possible, real-time tools for monitoring fishing operations, including for the implementation of technical measures, for mitigation requirements for target and bycatch species, as well as for sensitive species and for comparing and matching logbook and/or landing declaration data with data collected and reported by observers on board;\n- increase and enhance data collection resolution while exploring the potential of interconnecting vessel tracking and e-logbooks to improve interoperability and expand their usage in SSF and long-distance fisheries;\n- contribute to the standardisation on how data are collected and the harmonisation of implementing procedures and quality control for collecting and processing data with a view to using these data in fisheries management and improving the reliability of scientific advice;\n- improve the mechanisms for sharing fisheries dependent data among fisheries management authorities and institutions formally charged with provision of scientific advice;\n- improve the digital readiness of SSF, recreational fisheries and long distance fisheries by identifying solutions such as business models that encourage and enhance fishers’ adoption of digital technology as well as data sharing, through distribution of incentives and risks among stakeholders (i.e. fishers, policy makers, scientists).\nThe funded projects should contribute to the achievements of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals and global biodiversity framework COP-15 goals and targets for marine ecosystems and fishing areas.",
      "scope": "The implementation of the revised Fisheries Control Regulation (EU Regulation 2023/2842) and relevant implementing and delegating acts require tools to identify patterns, anomalies, trends and detect inconsistencies in electronic reporting (validation and cross-checking of data) at high spatial and temporal resolution, supporting more effective fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance. Moreover, it requires secure, tamper-resistant, accurate and innovative vessel tracking systems tailored for the specificities of different types of fisheries such as, small-scale fisheries. These systems need to ensure reliable monitoring, be cost-effective and easily deployed and maintained. In addition, monitoring and controlling the catch reporting by millions of recreational fishers in European waters and estimating the ecological impact of recreational fisheries requires new and effective strategies and tools.\nThe new European fisheries control system also calls for innovative remote sensing technology and satellite imaging systems equipped with automatic detection abilities. These tools are needed to monitor and control fishing operations, complement and cross check data from fisheries observers, and verify compliance with regulations. Such tools will also help to identify and combat IUU fishing activities (e.g., detecting illegal transhipments, illegal discards, unauthorised gear use, and unlicensed fishing) in EU waters and beyond and improve the European maritime situational awareness.\nFunded projects should firstly focus on extending data collection to encompass SSF, recreational fisheries and long-distance fisheries, enhancing MCS capabilities. Secondly, funded projects should develop, and test user-friendly technologies tailored for these sectors, while striving to reduce associated costs. Thirdly, funded projects should devise innovative MCS methods to improve efficiency alongside advancements in remote monitoring and surveillance technologies to support the effective implementation of relevant fisheries regulations and combat IUU fishing practices in these sectors. Fourthly, funded projects should emphasise the development of technology for automatic real-time data collection, including the vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and other vessel tracking technologies, and explore opportunities for interconnecting vessel tracking position, electronic monitoring systems and e-logbooks to enhance data resolution and expand their usage in SSF and long-distance fisheries. Finally, funded projects should focus on applications of artificial intelligence technologies for mining information and data deriving from various monitoring technologies in a timely and cost-efficient manner, for the purpose of supporting effective data collection and cross verification, as well as, monitoring of compliance with applicable fisheries rules and regulations.\nFunded projects should also include solutions to directly gather data from fishing activities, including data required under the DCF and for the meaningful application of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries management, such as data on biological, environmental, economic, social aspects of the fisheries and basic information on the fishers, vessels, and gear.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to contribute to increase the number of datasets in fisheries dependent data, also including non-commercial species and discards, while ensuring data collection standardisation as well as harmonisation of process and methods on how data are handled to support small scale fisheries data collection.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to take an integrated approach, encompassing the development of new fisheries monitoring and data collection and analysis for SSF, recreational fisheries and long-distance fisheries. Funded projects should showcase the expected outcomes through four case studies covering the following:\n- EU SSF in European Seas (Mediterranean Sea or Baltic Sea or Black Sea or North East Atlantic);\n- EU SSF in EU Outermost Regions [6] ;\n- recreational fisheries in EU waters;\n- EU long-distance fisheries in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.\nAdditional case studies can be included.\nProposals should include, in all stages (from conceptual development until the implementation of the outcomes) the involvement of fishers, other relevant actors, including citizens, and end users.\nProposals are encouraged to cooperate with actors such as the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The possible participation of the JRC in the project would consist in providing and/or analysing fisheries data.\nProposals should consider the 2024 recommendations provided by the Strategic Working group on Fisheries and Aquaculture Research (SCAR-Fish [7] ). Proposals are expected to allocate specific tasks and resources to link with relevant Horizon Europe projects, such as Fish-X, EveryFish, and OptiFish, and projects on the Digital Twin Ocean such as SURIMI and SEADITO as well as projects focusing on observing and mapping biodiversity coastal and marine ecosystems, such as OBAMA-NEXT, MARCO-BOLO and DiverSea and other biodiversity projects such as B-USEFUL.\nParticular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). When possible, data should become available through the European Marine Observation and Data network, ensuring their further availability for the development of fisheries management related applications through the EU Digital Twin Ocean core infrastructure (EDITO). Proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant data spaces.\n[1] Regulation EU 2017/1004, http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1004/oj .\n[2] Regulation EU 2023/2842, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2842/oj .\n[3] Vessels of less than 12 metres in length overall, according to the Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n[4] Non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport, according to the Regulation (EU) 2023/2842 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n[5] E.g., in international waters, including in particular those under the purview of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of third countries, including in particular in the context of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements.\n[6] https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/policy/themes/outermost-regions_en\n[7] https://scar-europe.org/fish-documents",

      "scope": "Mental health has become a major issue of public health, and economic and social concern across Europe. A healthy dietary pattern can affect mental health and well-being through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neurogenesis, microbiome- and immune-modifying mechanisms, as well as through epigenetic modifications [4] . A good nutritional status is important for maintaining normal body function and adequate growth and development and preventing or mitigating the dysfunction induced by internal or external factors. Environmental psychology has demonstrated the positive impact of healthy nutrition on self-perception, self-efficacy, and successful relationships, as well as on several psychological constructs.\nMoreover, alteration of the microbiome could also have an impact on neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disorders as microbiome has been linked to several mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia [5] .\nThe proposals should address all the following activities:\n- establish the specific food groups, beverages, macro and micronutrients needed in a daily diet (from food sources or to be integrated to the daily diet) to prevent the development of mental health disorders in Europe and explore the need to characterise and supplement a healthy diet with specific macro and micronutrients in children, adults, and older population affected by specific diseases related to mental health disorders through interviews and literature review;\n- establish, through a mapping of the most recent research and innovation projects, the 3-axis ‘diet-gut microbiome-host-health’ interplay to elucidate some molecular mechanisms and the causal relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and some mental health disorders (including the establishment of possible relevant biomarkers as necessary);\n- provide recommendations and develop specific communication materials for prevention campaigns, in line with international and national health and dietary advice and related policies, for national authorities and for nutritional professionals, to communicate the link between healthy diets and mental health, as well as the need to supplement a healthy diet with macro- and micronutrients and/or adapt dietary patterns to prevent mental health disorders to patients;\n- provide recommendations on how established deficiencies or excess intake of macro and micronutrients could be addressed, in line with international and national health and dietary advice and related policies, including means to increase or decrease nutrients in the diet, in particular in vulnerable groups.\nThe information is collected for different ranges of the population in Member States and Associated Countries. Experts, which make the link between the role of food groups, beverages, macro- and micronutrients to mental health, should work closely in identifying the main food groups, beverages, macro- and micronutrients needed or to be limited in a daily diet and which are linked to specific mental health disorders and the possible development of mental disease.\nThe involvement of citizens and civil society, including Citizen Science approach is encouraged as an appropriate research methodology/approach for this topic. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThe proposals should include a dedicated task in the workplan and appropriate resources to collaborate with the projects funded under this topic.\nThe proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders and value chain actors including industry, nutritionists, healthcare professionals, scientists, patients, consumers associations. The active participation and engagement of different stakeholders should span the entire project development and implementation to ensure performance and sustainability and maximise the final impact.\nThe proposals should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.\nWhere relevant, the proposals could consider complementarities and avoid duplication with other related funded projects. In particular ERA4Health partnership and the Nutribrain call topic [6] and JPND’s ERA-NET Cofund (JPcofund2) and the project ‘EURO-FINGERS multimodal precision prevention toolbox for dementia in Alzheimer’s disease’, which included nutritional guidance [7] (Call - Better Health and care, economic growth and sustainable health systems (H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2020) [8] .\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/new-report-food-2030-research-and-innovation-pathways-action-20-2023-12-04_en\n[2] COM (2023) 298 final.\n[3] https://health.ec.europa.eu/non-communicable-diseases/healthier-together-eu-non-communicable-diseases-initiative_en\n[4] Maurizio Muscaritoli, The Impact of nutrients on mental health and well-being: insights from the literature.

It will also promote innovation through the creation of new start-ups companies in the field of food production via biotechnology. The outcomes will foster EU strategic autonomy and leadership in delivering innovative nutrient production processes through business models for food applications in industrial plants and SMEs.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- the costs and resource-efficiency of bioreactors and upstream and downstream processing is delivered by industry or by other industry related actors (e.g., association, consultants, or engineering experts);\n- the environmental and climate impacts resulting from the reduction of CO 2 in the air are better understood;\n- food producing companies support the set-up of new or existing living laboratory facilities and pre-commercialisation infrastructure or shared infrastructure solutions to test the implementation of biotechnologies;\n- innovative technologies are identified for the use of microorganisms that have been genetically engineered transforming CO 2 into nutrients for food purposes and scaled up by SMEs and innovative start-ups;\n- existing pilot plants in Europe are improved to scale up the production by identifying and removing barriers that slow down the scaling up of the production of nutrients for food and food ingredients.",
      "scope": "Innovations using microorganisms have the potential to deliver benefits in several fields, such as agriculture, food and feed, industries, environment, marine/aquatic and biodiversity. The use of microorganisms genetically engineered for precision fermentation is an innovative approach that could significantly contribute to safer food systems [3] . This biotechnology leverages the capabilities of microorganisms to produce nutrients including enzymes, fats, and other valuable compounds with high efficiency and specificity. Therefore, it represents a key area for investments and research, promising to revolutionise the food system and to contribute to a healthier planet.\nThe proposals should address all the following activities:\n- analyse and provide the costs and investments needed for the use of the biotechnology for scaling up production of nutrients through the use of genetically engineered microorganisms that capture CO 2 from the air and/or from on-site plant emissions;\n- establish an open space database or platform for companies to create their own business models for precision fermentation using genetically engineered microorganisms and perform a pre-commercialisation testing alongside business model strategies development as well as also in situ application;\n- establish business models for industry and for in-situ application, considering also gases other than CO 2 ;\n- evaluate the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of European companies that use precision fermentation with genetically engineered microorganisms and their contribution to reducing the presence of CO 2 in the air. Climate-related aspects should also be considered as far as possible;\n- provide a scale-up feasibility analysis for the developed biotechnologies which should take into consideration in the design process the feasibility for up-scaling, already from the early stages.\nThe proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of existing private companies in Europe, specifically the participation of SMEs and start-ups.\nThe proposals should include a dedicated task in the workplan and appropriate resources to collaborate with the projects funded under this topic.\nThe proposals are expected to establish links with Regional Innovation Valleys for the bioeconomy and food systems (RIV4BFS) [4] to encourage the deployment of technologies related to biotechnological processes across the EU regions.\nIf possible, cross-articulation with data spaces, and notably with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) should be foreseen, exploiting synergies and complementarities of the different approaches. Proposals are also encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures such as IBISBA or other relevant research infrastructures [5] as well as the services offered by the existing technology infrastructures.\nTo maximise the impacts of R&I, collaboration with international partners, in particular with those established in the United States, is encouraged.\n[1] New Report: Food 2030 Research and Innovation – Pathways for action 2.0 - European Commission (europa.eu) .

The foreseen consortium has expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership and the activities to be implemented by calls and internal activities. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe scope of the application for this call on the European partnership on sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate should focus on the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven to ten years which includes inspiration for calls for research projects and horizontal activities to allow the Partnership to operate and to achieve its specific objectives. The application should also consider new and upcoming priorities, and this should be reflected in their upcoming work.\nThe partnership should seek to include additional partners, in particular from Member States and Associated countries not yet in the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-9.\nIt is expected that the partnership organises joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects. The partnership should collaborate closely with relevant partnerships in Horizon Europe Cluster 6 and beyond, the partnership should describe specific activities foreseen to strengthen the synergies with other related Missions and Partnerships.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-FARM2FORK-01-9: European partnership on sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-9: European partnership on sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and any additional partners, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.",

Identify options that allow for the safe use of new, locally produced, alternative supplementary foods to be certified by WHO and used, based on the health status of the child and the local conditions, as alternatives to the current ‘all RUTF’ approach. An approach that is more and more challenged by the increasing production and transportation costs, lack of access to beneficiaries, mainly in fragile and conflict affected countries and with a large carbon footprint.\nThe topic follows the Food 2030 approach, in particular its co-benefits on nutrition, climate, circularity and innovation and implements the FNSSA roadmap of the AU-EU research and innovation partnership. It is also part of a humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus action.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n- scaling up locally produced RUSF and RUTF will help improving access to the life saving nutrition products for more children in need;\n- sustainable and locally produced RUSF and RUTFs will enable national governments to develop versions of these products that are best suited to the local context, having higher acceptability, and provide the regulatory frameworks to manufacturers for national production in line with the relevant Codex Alimentarius Guidelines, such as CXG 95-2022;\n- supporting African countries’ governments in their effort of local production of energy, protein and micronutrient supplements contributing to the objectives of climate change adaptation and mitigation, sustainable and efficient management of natural resources, resilience and disaster risk reduction as well as protection and restoration of biodiversity.\nIn parallel research could be developed around new safe and efficacious, science based recipes that could complement and replace under specific circumstances, in collaboration with the Nutrition Technical Advisory Board and after the validation by WHO, the exclusive use of RUTF for persons not affected by severe acute malnutrition, while making sure that relevant quality criteria, information practices and use criteria are established (based on the child health status and local circumstances).",
      "scope": "Research and innovation collaboration between Europe and Africa will help the African countries (health specialists, producers, seed companies, SMEs and food industries) to develop/ scale up the relevant and sustainable local production of RUSF and RUTF or any other types of supplements and related ingredients, using varieties adapted to local climate and agro-ecological conditions, thereby protecting and restoring biodiversity. Thereby contributing to reduce the climate footprint of production and transport in line with the objectives of climate change adaptation and mitigation and sustainable and efficient management of natural resources. Implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food systems actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research. Link up for clustering to other projects of the AU-EU research and innovation priorities, in particular linked to Food Systems transition projects and the wider range of projects in Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA), Climate Change and Sustainable Energy (CCSE) and the AU-EU Innovation Union using the network linkages to the CEA-First project and the International Research Consortium on FNSSA.\nInnovation: Proposals should foresee a space for mentoring and accelerating innovative business concepts, including social innovation and upscaling in view of African or European food business entrepreneurs and start-ups with special consideration of women and the diaspora using cascading funding opportunities. Proposals should involve financial support to third parties e.g. to academic researchers, health institutes, start-ups, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed assessment approaches or collect or prepare data sets or provide other contributions to achieve the project objectives. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support will be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. Proposals should involve contributions from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.",

Successful proposals should address the requirements from relevant EU regulatory frameworks, including where relevant needs for pre-market authorisation.\nProposals should perform economic cost-benefit analysis of the practical implementation of the innovations developed within the project. Proposals should describe an exploitation pathway tailor-made for the developed innovations through the different necessary steps (e.g. market research, manufacturing, regulatory approvals and licensing, IP management etc.) in order to accelerate exploitation of the results.\nProposed activities must apply the concept of the 'multi-actor approach' and allow for adequate involvement of relevant actors including farmers and SMEs. Proposals should benefit various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming. Proposals should develop publicly available diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, e.g., audiovisual materials, brochures, presenting the innovations.\nSME participation is expected.

      "scope": "This action is an application-oriented initiative, responding to the new GEO post-2025 strategy and is aimed at combining and advancing existing European Earth observation services and solutions, that were prototyped under relevant Horizon, Copernicus, and other EU and national projects and initiatives, and scaling them up with end-users and customers towards wide adoption. In support of the European Green Deal targets, the project should develop, test, demonstrate and customise 2 to 3 integrated solutions, using advanced digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, including generative AI, with a clear path towards operationalisation that should correspond to some of the following selected focus areas of the GEO Post-2025 implementation plan:\n- Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security;\n- Water Resilience;\n- Ecosystems and Biodiversity;\n- Carbon Management;\n- Disaster Resilience.\nThe solutions should be co-designed with relevant European users, including local, regional and national governments (such as through the Copernicus National User Forums), and mature business plans should be developed in the project to ensure operational uptake after the project, including by public/private procurers or service providers, Copernicus services, or GEO flagships and initiatives.\nThe activity should leverage European infrastructures and where relevant integrate various remote sensing platforms such as satellites, manned and unmanned aviation (drones). It should further build on and contribute to the existing European digital ecosystem, including different research and service infrastructures, like European data spaces, citizen science initiatives and national, regional, and global databases of in-situ observation, and support their evolution. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call topic and other relevant projects should be ensured. To this end, proposals should earmark the appropriate resources for coordination activities accordingly in their work plan.\nOutreach and training activities are expected to reach the wider European EO community and to support further the upscaling of European/national/sub-national EO services beyond this project and actively promote pan-European synergies.

In line with this CAP objective, and other related policies [1] , the successful proposal will enhance knowledge and analytical tools useful to the development and implementation of effective governance and policy mixes aimed at improving the functioning of EU agriculture and food value chains (hereafter ‘value chains’). The successful proposal will contribute to support value chains that generate a fair income to farmers and create enabling conditions for the transition to sustainable, resilient and competitive farming systems.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- the capacity of the research community to analyse and model the EU agricultural and food sectors, their market structures, and the formation, transmission and distribution of costs, prices, risks and economic values along value chains is enhanced; likewise, policymakers, farmers and other value chain operators have a better understanding of the functioning of value chains and the formation, transmission and distribution of costs, prices, risks and economic values along them;\n- policymakers at EU, national and local level have a better understanding of the impacts of policies on the functioning of value chains, and are therefore better equipped to design and support the uptake of existing and future policy tools strengthening farmers’ position in them;\n- farmers and consumers benefit from improved policy mixes, fair business interactions and tools reinforcing the bargaining power of farmers with upstream and downstream operators and supporting more sustainable, transparent and resilient value chains.",
      "scope": "The understanding and the capacity to analyse the functioning of agriculture and food sectors, value chains [2] and market structures remain incomplete and oversimplified. This contributes to a knowledge gap on the relations between farm production costs and price transmission, from input prices faced by farmers to food prices faced by consumers. Market and value chain conditions and dynamics affecting farmers’ bargaining power are important drivers of farmers decision-making and income. They define the prices of the inputs and services bought and the commodity and non-commodity outputs sold by farmers. Hence, they contribute to the choices of production and business model, investments, and to the adoption of sustainable practices. A better understanding of the composition and functioning of value chains and market settings, in a granular and comprehensive way, would support accurate assessments of the socio-economic impacts of policies and business operations. It would also support the development of effective, evidence-based policies and business strategies adapted to the diverse conditions faced by farmers and consumers that will improve the functioning of the agricultural and food markets.\nProposals should:\n- provide an analytical framework and tools capturing the complexity and heterogeneity of EU value chain structures, in particular relative to: their length (number of intermediaries from the input industry to the consumers); their scale (global, EU, national or local); the degree and forms of vertical coordination; the degree and forms of horizontal coordination between farmers; the degree of concentration of operations at all stages; the degree of product (quality) differentiation.\n- the framework should include a consolidated conceptualisation such that it can be adapted to represent the diversity of cases within and between sectors. The framework should also be sustained with empirical evidence and data to the maximum extent;\n- apply the developed analytical framework and tools to empirically model production costs, price formation, price transmission, risk, cost and economic value distributions, and profit margins along selected value chains, and to characterise sources of market failures and occurrence of unfair trading practices. Proposals should consider different economic contexts (e.g., high/low prices, different patterns of price volatilities, etc.);\n- develop and/or improve adequate indicators and collect the necessary data to improve the assessment of farmers bargaining power with upstream and downstream operators of value chains in analytical tools and models;\n- explore, characterise, and analyse the interactions between value chain operators and the characteristics of value chains affecting farmers’ bargaining and decision-making power, in particular on the type of farm business and structural changes (e.g., farm size, legal form, etc.). The proposed activities should include the analysis of the transaction relationships between farmers and input suppliers, farmers and service providers, and farmers and buyers of agricultural products. Among others, this work should analyse the types of contracts, provisions, clauses, standards, indications and calculations of prices and volumes, and how economic value, costs, and risks are shared among the operators. Proposals are encouraged to analyse whether farmers’ bargaining and decision-making power is affected by socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, etc.).\n- explore existing and/or propose new policy and business solutions and tools to reinforce farmers bargaining power in value chains. Identify good practices (governance, awareness raising, etc.) for their successful implementation and uptake. Among the possible solutions, proposals should explore: coordination approaches between farmers and/or between farmers and other value chain operators (e.g., form, size, contractual agreements, capacity building, etc.); tools (e.g., data tools, innovative technologies) to increase market transparency and the accessibility and use of information. This should contribute to better inform farmers and consumers on the distribution of costs, prices, economic value, and risks along value chains and improve the fairness and efficiency of agriculture and food markets.\nProposals should develop dissemination materials (e.g., policy briefs, research findings briefs, audio or visual presentations, etc.) summarising the results of key deliverables to facilitate the uptake of R&I outputs by decisionmakers in policy or business contexts.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies, projects, initiatives, and processes [3] .\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] e.g., the EU Directive 2019/633 on unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain, and the EU Regulation 1308/2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products.\n[2] The agriculture and food value chains encompass all operators from the producers of necessary inputs for agricultural production to the consumers, including farmers, food and bio-based industries (including processing), retail, wholesale, food service (including public procurement), as well as the suppliers of inputs and services such as seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, energy, machinery, packaging, repair, transport, finance, advice, and logistics.\n[3] e.g., producer organisations operational programmes, the EU Agri-Food Chain Observatory, fi-compass, etc.",

The successful proposal will contribute to the impact of this destination on just societal transformation, community empowerment and societal participation in support to the green transition.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other relevant stakeholders have a clear understanding of the role environmental services play in a flourishing society, and engage in payment for environmental services schemes with result-based and/or collective and/or spatially coordinated approaches with the governance perspective of ensuring long-term financing capacity at scale;\n- policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other relevant stakeholders have improved knowledge and innovative tools to develop, implement and upscale payment for environmental services schemes with result-based and/or collective and/or spatially coordinated approaches adapted to the diverse contexts. Farmers and businesses from diverse farming contexts widely participate on a long-term basis in innovative payment for environmental services schemes with result-based and/or collective and/or spatially coordinated approaches;\n- society at large benefit from more targeted support towards the delivery of agri-environment-climate public goods with positive social, economic, biodiversity and climate outcomes.",

Research and practical experiences from a diversity of initiatives from the public and private sector, provided evidence and guidance on cost-effective and well-contextualised design to support practitioners. Implementing more result-based, collective or spatially coordinated approaches in payment conditionality rules are among the key recommendations to best achieve impacts. While some Member States integrated such approaches in the design of some eco-schemes and agri-environment-climate measures in the CAP, important barriers to the upscaling and long-term implementation remain to be overcome. Building sufficient institutional, monitoring, funding and financing capacity are necessary to increase synergies between economic viability, environmental effectiveness and longevity. This strengthened capacity would support the achievement of more sustainable and positive social, economic, climate and biodiversity outcomes effectively contributing to the Green Deal objectives. Mobilising more the private sector in those innovative payment for environmental services schemes would contribute to address those barriers.\nProposals should:\n- develop and/or improve, test, pilot and evaluate payment for environmental services schemes with result-based and/or collective and/or spatially coordinated approaches in real-life conditions considering a diversity of farming contexts;\n- put a special focus on mobilising private funding (e.g., value chain approaches, market-based instruments, crowdfunding, bottom-up approaches, etc.) and assessing the social and economic implications of the schemes with the perspective of long-term implementation and financial viability under different scenarios and socio-economic contexts;\n- based on an analysis of the role of agriculture and food value chains in supporting and valorising farmers’ provision of environmental services, develop and/or improve approaches supporting a just and fair remuneration of farmers for these services;\n- develop and/or improve and apply robust and cost-effective monitoring of the environmental services provided by farmers;\n- identify barriers and enablers for the implementation and upscaling of payment for environmental services schemes with result-based and/or collective and/or spatially coordinated approaches and propose effective solutions to address them. Special attention should be given to not repeat but build on and complement the state-of-the art;\n- support capacity building, training, reskilling, and education, in particular on the technical, financial, legal and administrative implications of contractual arrangements, enabling farmers and other involved practitioners, including the private sector, to implement the proposed solutions.\nProposals should ensure complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects including from the Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe” and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant LIFE projects, EU-funded studies, pilot projects, and processes [2] .\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.).\nThe JRC participation could involve contributing to the testing of payment for environmental services schemes via experiments.\nProposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, and businesses. Involvement of SMEs, in particular of farmers, for developing, improving, testing and/or piloting the proposed solutions is strongly encouraged. As an option, proposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate the engagement of SMEs in testing and/or piloting the proposed solutions. A maximum of 10% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. In this case, consortia need to define the selection process of entities, for which financial support may be granted.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] e.g., climate change mitigation, soil functionality, biodiversity, water quality and water availability preservation and restoration, resilience to extreme weather events, animal welfare, etc.\n[2] e.g., rural development programmes, EU-wide certification scheme for carbon removals, etc.",

      "scope": "With the current challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, resource scarcity, new working patterns and consumers’ behaviour changes, there is the need for a more innovative, sustainable farming in the EU. However, the EU's farming sector is facing a steady decline of workforce in the last fifteen years, also depending on demographic challenges such as an ageing farming population. Thus, the need for attracting and supporting young and new farmers is critical. The motivations, commercial nature and business models for farming have changed due to the recent climate and environmental challenges and to the new opportunities offered by the technological and digital innovations, but at the same time, due to social and economic factors.\nWhile it is a vital sector, farming still remains largely poorly understood by society, subject to many myths and misconceptions. To develop and implement effective policies and business strategies that enhance the attractiveness of the sector, it is essential to better understand how the perception of farming by society is determined by socio-economic and other factors (for example, but not limited to: income, labour conditions, land markets, use of sustainable practices, mental health, social wellbeing, social, economic and gender inequalities, generational renewal, etc…). Sound governance and policies creating an attractive environment, inclusive fair job conditions for farmers will enable the transition to more resilient and sustainable farming systems.\nNew interdisciplinary knowledge also stemming from disciplines such as social sciences and humanities is necessary to explore and better understand the ways in which agriculture is expressed and thought about, and its changing relationship with society. Activities under this topic should unlock the potential of cultural and creative industries to improve the communication about agriculture to society.\nProposals should:\n- improve understanding of the socio-economic and other factors and conditions influencing attractiveness of farming as an economic activity and profession, and how farmers see and project themselves in the future of farming;\n- examine the factors that influence the decision to become or to leave the profession of farm worker or farm owner in diverse regions across Europe, incorporating storytelling and narrative techniques;\n- explore and analyse how farmers’ interactions vary within the farming community and with the broad society based on different factors (e.g. historical, sectorial, territorial, farm size, age, education, gender, etc) and how those factors influence their social and economic roles;\n- explore and assess the perception of and communication on farming across society at large according to different societal actors (individuals or groups that play a significant role in shaping and influencing societal norms, values, and institutions) and economic actors (individuals, businesses, or organizations that participate in economic activities, such as production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services) across the EU with different perspectives (e.g. historical, sectorial, territorial, size, age, education, gender, etc);\n- map existing agricultural education and training programmes across Europe and provide recommendations, based on the evidence collected, on how they can be designed to appeal to a diverse range of individuals;\n- improve societal perception of farming through the mobilisation of and cooperation between cultural and creative industries (CCIs);\n- map, assess, promote existing and propose new solutions, good practices, initiatives, approaches, that aim at improving the attractiveness of farming sector and the connection between the farming community and society, and widely disseminate to policymakers, farmers, businesses and other relevant actors.\nProposals should support collaborative and interdisciplinary work. Thus, proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines, such as sociology, geography, demography, communication, behavioural science, anthropology or education. Proposals may involve digital media, traditional media, arts, marketing, cultural disciplines (and beyond) to contribute to improving attractiveness of the farming sector.

      "scope": "Bioeconomy [1] is a place-based policy framework. The application of sustainability principles in concrete contexts therefore depends on available (environmental and human) assets, challenges and priorities, as well as access to logistics, finance and infrastructure. It is therefore important that sustainability principles are developed both with high clarity of their intention as well as sufficient flexibility to enable implementation in differing contexts. In particular, it is important to assess the impact of bioeconomy on ecosystems and to develop options on how to protect /restore ecosystems while developing bioeconomy. The sustainability principles must be able to give clear direction how to manage situations of conflicting objectives, and ensure that no unintended environmental, economic social consequences follow, preventing unsustainable use of biomass.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n- develop or improve the sustainability assessment of bio-based and food value chains, both from land and aquatic systems and their related value webs to increase transparency for businesses and consumers, enabling better informed choices;\n- analyse the performance of bioeconomy innovation ecosystems with regard to social, economic, and environmental sustainability, and demonstrate their long-term feasibility (e.g. with regard to infrastructure, climate adaptation, biodiversity and ecosystem protection and restoration). Demonstrate the applicability of bioeconomy sustainability principles in regional case studies, based on the concept of Regional Innovation Valleys for Bioeconomy and Food Systems [2] ;\n- identify and address challenges for the EU, Member States and regions (e.g. public authorities) to deploy sustainability principles and providing policy recommendations to overcome them.\nThe possible participation of the JRC in the project would ensure that the approach proposed is compatible with the bioeconomy working streams of the Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines, including gender studies [3] . Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors with complementary knowledge to achieve the objectives of the project, including for instance relevant rural actors.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will seek synergies with other with other EU programmes and funding instruments initiatives, and ensure complementarities with relevant activities carried out or to be carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe (e.g. funded projects under past ZEROPOLLUTION and CIRCBIO Cluster 6 calls).\nProposals should build on the findings of the “Global Resources Outlook [4] ” 2024 from the International Resource Panel.\n[1] See definition: European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, A sustainable bioeconomy for Europe – Strengthening the connection between economy, society and the environment – Updated bioeconomy strategy, Publications Office, 2018, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/792130\n[2] Concept of Regional Innovation Valleys for Bioeconomy and Food Systems\n[3] See overview of gender and EU bioeconomy: Infografías COOPID AP .

      "scope": "A sustainable and circular bioeconomy relies on a management guaranteeing the preservation and restoration of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems while providing sufficient biomass for the production of food, materials and energy required for peoples' wellbeing. On one hand we see a decline of biodiversity, a gap in ecosystem carbon sequestration or lacking capacity of the biosphere to absorb pollutants; on the other hand the increasing competition of biomass use between food, materials, and energy indicates a potential sustainable biomass gap in Europe [2] . Projections indicate that this sustainable biomass gap could be exacerbated in the decades to come. To anticipate potential areas of conflicts and to develop holistic and coherent policy packages on biomass and land and sea uses requires tools that can inform policy makers how environmental, economic and social objectives can be met based on the available sustainable biomass, in order to close the biomass gap while assessing and minimizing the environmental, economic and wider societal impact and considering social justice and equality aspects on local, regional and EU levels. The Joint Research Centre is working on a deliberation tool on 'Integrated Bioeconomy Land Use Assessment' (IBLUA) [3] at the European level. However, an assessment at such aggregate rough level is not sufficient for informing policies at national and regional level. This topic is encouraged to build upon the JRC’s tools developed for the European-level approach and assessment to improve context-specific deliberation tools that can assess social and economic outcomes of policies at regional level and support regional policy makers in finding best context-specific policies related to land and sea and biomass.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n- develop tools (including methodologies and processes) for national and regional policy- and decision-makers to carry out integrated bioeconomy land and sea assessments, with the objective to minimize the ‘land/sea footprint’ and provide different land and sea biomass uses solutions, considering their feasibility, viability, and societal desirability (e.g. region specific). The assessment shall consider natural, semi-natural, and managed (agricultural and forestry, fisheries and aquaculture) ecosystems and the impacts of land/sea use on ecosystem conditions, biodiversity and supply of ecosystem services and interlinkages, considering the System of Environmental Economic Accounting set of indicators and the JRC's EU-wide ecosystem condition assessment;\n- assess and develop integrated and coherent policy objectives to improve land and sea biomass use in national and regional contexts, considering the inclusive approaches to developing a wide range of policy narratives (e.g. objectives) pursued by the JRC in the EU-level assessment (i.e. IBLUA). The different narratives described qualitatively will be quantitatively represented (e.g. reporting relevant social, economic and environmental indicators) in the deliberation tool, which should be able to capture different configurations of land and sea and biomass use, including dietary needs, energy uses, bio-based products expansion, and carbon farming; considering the challenges to land/sea ownership (e.g. private vs public) and the options stem from the tool to resolve them;\n- demonstrate how the deliberation tool could be implemented in a network of regions covering different socio-economic situations and climate/ecological zones in the EU and associated countries to improve just and sustainable land/sea management, food security and circular biomass uses.\nThe participation of the JRC in the project is encouraged to ensure that the approach proposed is compatible with the bioeconomy working streams of the Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy and with the various JRC’s tools and methodologies developed for the EU bioeconomy assessment.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and ensure complementarities with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including the Horizon Europe Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe”, and seek synergies with other EU programmes and funding instruments.\nProposals should build on the findings of the “Global Resources Outlook [4] ” 2024 from the International Resource Panel. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by European research infrastructures.

Although some platforms for networking and cooperation on the bioeconomy exist, more can be done to strengthen relationship building across European sectors, stakeholder groups, generations, languages, levels of governance, or professions and advance the cross-cutting insights that drive bioeconomy solutions and improved governance. Barriers including insufficient understanding of the bioeconomy concept and its potential, language, limited capacities to engage in knowledge exchange, unsuitable engagement formats, or a lack of mutual understanding are some of the factors that contribute to this situation.\nEfforts to strengthen and connect bioeconomy networks across Member States and Associated Countries will foster interconnectedness amongst stakeholders, across sectors, regions and disciplines, to strengthen policy coherence and implementation. It will accelerate relation building and transfer of knowledge on bioeconomy, help the development and implementation of the EU bioeconomy strategy in Europe, and contribute to scale-up place-based solutions that address EU challenges in different regional contexts.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n- establish and develop an EU-wide platform (one-stop shop, multilingual) for networking and engagement on the bioeconomy, that brings together EU practitioners, researchers, investors, policy makers and education providers,\n- support of international research and innovation bioeconomy networks and initiatives (e.g. International Bioeconomy Forum or International Advisory Council on Global Bioeconomy) to foster international research collaboration and Science-to-Policy interfaces for bioeconomy;\n- develop communication strategies and tools, and organise events to inform EU, national and regional actors and stakeholders about bioeconomy deployment, successful bioeconomy initiatives and solutions (i.e., open access to industrial demonstrations sites), including from relevant EU-funded R&I projects, and other EU programmes (i.e., Interreg: European Territorial Co-operation);\n- stimulate dialogue on bioeconomy solutions and initiatives, to build relations, exchange knowledge and support mutual learning, across European sectors, stakeholder groups, generations, languages, levels of governance, or professions; align these activities with needs under the EU bioeconomy strategy and related policies including on climate and biodiversity;\n- implement lean business models to manage the platform (e.g. secretariat, operations, events) and its activities in a sustainable manner beyond the end of the project using public and private funding;\n- liaise and collaborate with bioeconomy education institutes for improved skills development initiatives and networks to develop and deploy innovative interactive bioeconomy education material in support of both the informal and formal education at all levels;\n- engage and train investors on the European bioeconomy to foster investment in bioeconomy sectors.\nProposals are encouraged to work together with relevant initiatives including those of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (Knowledge Centre on Bioeconomy, Bioeconomy Monitoring System), the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, and BIOEAST. Proposals are expected to build on results from EU R&I projects including BioVoices and ShapingBio.",

Towards this end, the inclusion of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines is encouraged.\nInnovative decision-making approaches should be investigated to support and facilitate international governance and negotiations at European and global level, as well as national actors on sustainable and resilient environmental observations matters, regarding investments, operations, accessibility, gaps and innovation. Inter-operability with European data spaces and other existing data infrastructures should be considered.\nThe approaches should be demonstrated in the context of one of the following specific use case areas (and proposals should identify which use case area they are addressing):\n- Area A: monitoring global anthropogenic and natural greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, in support of the Paris Agreement;\n- Area B: ozone depleting substances and F-Gases, in support of the Montreal Protocol.\nProposals are expected to demonstrate a good understanding of data requirements for policy implementation. The optimisation of the observing systems should identify and address in an iterative process the needs of well identified user groups, like for example modelling communities, Copernicus, Destination Earth, international organisations, and regional or national authorities.\nTools and approach should be flexible enough to be applied to other observing systems and examples. The project is expected to benefit from and leverage underlying work of ESA, EUMETSAT, Copernicus, or European Research Infrastructures (ICOS, ACTRIS, etc.).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2024/573, http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/573/oj .",

      "scope": "Considering that approximately one third of EU citizens live and work in rural areas, it is key to empower rural communities – farmers, foresters and other rural actors - in the transition towards sustainability and resilience so that no one is left behind. In this context, digital twins’ technology has gained attention in the past decade because of its potential in addressing challenges across numerous application areas and transforming the way businesses and public administrations operate. Nevertheless, research and innovation related to the use of digital twins in rural areas and relevant key economic sectors, in particular agriculture and forestry, is still limited. Digital twins require further exploration, innovation, testing and demonstration to fully exploit their potential, and reach higher level of maturity and scalability across different territorial and sectoral contexts.\nProposals should:\n- design, prototype and test the use of digital twins to improve sustainability and resilience of rural areas and related key sectors (i.e. agriculture, forestry and other relevant sectors). Innovations should be co-created with rural actors to respond to their needs and tested for their feasibility for the territorial development opportunities or challenges that they bring;\n- develop a detailed map of the villages in three-dimension employing digital and data technologies. The map should be freely accessible to local authorities, researchers, private companies and other relevant actors to monitor key parameters, test ideas and explore smart(er) and more competitive, sustainable and resilient forms of village development. Where relevant, focus should be given to the planning, monitoring and management of green areas as well as other natural elements in the village that can improve resilience to climate change;\n- develop a public web-based platform allowing users to visit the 3D model of the village twins remotely, including through the use of immersive technologies (e.g. Virtual Reality). By integrating various technologies, the platform should allow the user to access information on selected elements of the cultural, historical and/or natural heritage of the village for promotional purposes while establishing a mechanism for residents to provide feedback on existing and proposed initiatives of village development;\n- assess the potential of the investigated digital technologies in promoting forms of collaborative, open and citizen-centric governance;\n- measure and assess the costs and benefits of the implementation of digital twins in the rural areas and sectors of application, including enablers and barriers to their uptake and acceptance by the target groups, adequacy and availability of existing public/private funding opportunities, incentives, and new business models supporting their development beyond project duration;\n- provide research, business and policy recommendations supporting the successful deployment of the developed digital twins in rural areas and relevant key sectors;\n- support training and capacity building for local administrations and rural actors in order to share best practices, develop skills, create and maintain a rural innovation ecosystem enabling them to benefit from the innovations developed for the digital transition in rural areas.\nThe application of the developed technologies should support the implementation of the smart villages concept oriented towards relatively underdeveloped and remotely located rural areas and communities.\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors with complementary knowledge to achieve the objectives of the projects, including for instance relevant rural actors (in particular end-users of the digital twins), universities, research and technology organisations.\nProposals must integrate the gender dimension in the implementation of the activities (e.g. to address gender-specific needs affecting design and testing of the developed technologies, when investigating benefits and limitations, gathering and analysing disaggregated data, in the development of training and communication material as well as research and policy recommendations).\nMoreover, proposals should build on results and ensure complementarities with other Horizon 2020/ Europe as well as other relevant EU-funded initiatives and projects (e.g. EU Missions, project that may follow from the topic “HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data”) and demonstrate adequate planning and use of resources for this purpose.\nProposals may involve financial support to third parties, e.g. to relevant rural actors (including farmers, foresters and other rural businesses), academic researchers, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs, to develop, test or validate the developed digital twins and/or to provide other contributions to achieve the project objectives. A maximum 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. By integrating relevant SSH expertise (e.g. gender expertise), the successful proposal aims to produce meaningful results that enhance the societal impact of related research activities, while delivering locally-based solutions, engaging residents, rural actors and leading to behavioural changes.\nProposals should cover various biogeographical regions with a balanced coverage reflecting the various pedo-climatic zones in Europe in a representative way and taking into account different types of villages (e.g., different size, remoteness, degree of digital maturity, reliance on economic sectors, exposure and vulnerability to climate change etc.) and farming systems.\nThe possible contribution of the JRC could involve support in monitoring and modelling activities applied to rural areas, agriculture and forestry.\nProposals should develop diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials (e.g. audiovisual materials, brochures) presenting the digital twins and other R&I solutions developed within the project and feed them into communication channels most consulted by the potential end-users.",

      "expected_outcome": "Successful proposal will support the EU policies related to agriculture, forestry and/or rural areas, including related climate, biodiversity, and other environmental policies. The focus will be on the cross-cutting objective of the common agricultural policy (CAP) to enhance knowledge flows among AKIS [1] actors, in particular end-users [2] . The successful thematic network will support the objective by widely sharing existing and new knowledge in a language and format that is easy to understand and targeted to end-users and by building a more informed, interconnected and engaged AKIS community. It will address the need of end-users for impartial and tailored knowledge that is key to foster the transitions to more competitive, sustainable and resilient agriculture and/or forestry and/or rural areas.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n- collected practice-oriented research findings, innovative solutions and best practices, are presented in an attractive and understandable way, updated and maintained in the long-term [3] , and made easily accessible by using the most appropriate channels for end-users;\n- practice-ready knowledge and solutions, both generated by research and innovation (R&I) [4] and collected from practice, are widely disseminated to, shared and implemented by end-users;\n- AKIS at EU and national/regional levels are more effective and the flow of practice-ready knowledge and solutions between end-users and all other relevant AKIS actors is increased across the EU in a geographically balanced way, improving cost-effectiveness of solutions and taking into account the differences between the territories.",
      "scope": "The research findings, innovative solutions, practical knowledge and best practices, are not sufficiently known, shared and used in practice, despite the sustained investment in R&I to support farmers and/or foresters and/or rural communities in becoming more competitive, sustainable and resilient. Moreover, national/regional and sectoral AKIS are insufficiently connected and organised to intensify thematic collaboration between researchers, advisors, and end-users.\nProposals should:\n- select the theme of the thematic network in a bottom-up way in order to respond to the most urgent need(s) from practice; explain the relevance of the theme in relation to end-users’ need(s), clarifying the added-value of the proposal and how it avoids duplication in relation to the ongoing or completed thematic networks and projects [5] ;\n- collect and compile all up-to-date scientific and practical knowledge, best practices and innovative solutions, which are effective and ready for use in practice to address the end-users' needs, but not commonly known and/or used by the end-users; and, if needed, translate/adapt them to diverse local contexts;\n- develop and share widely an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing informative materials and training courses using the most effective approaches, formats, tools (including audio-visual) and channels to reach as many advisors and end-users as possible. The information provided should be easy to access and understand, and translated into at least all 24 EU official languages to allow dissemination across the whole EU. As much as possible, the outputs of the thematic network should serve education and training, knowledge exchange programmes, AKIS knowledge hubs, advisors providing targeted advice, peer-to-peer learning activities, etc.;\n- provide a summary of the costs and benefits analysis of the collected practices for the end-users, and include these aspects explicitly in the informative materials and training courses;\n- feed all the practice-oriented outputs directly into EU, national and regional AKIS dissemination channels that are most used and trusted by end-users in the diverse contexts, including (but not limited to) the EU and National CAP Networks [6] , the EU-FarmBook online platform and the AKISConnect platform [7] and relevant advisory networks [8] ;\n- mobilise also relevant AKIS actors and use AKIS actions at EU/national/regional and European levels to share the outputs of the project widely across the EU.\nThe proposal should include a dedicated work package, providing adequate resources for collecting outputs from the EIP-AGRI Operational Group projects (OGs) [9] on the theme chosen, as well as creating collaboration opportunities and fostering knowledge exchanges with and between them. The proposal should indicate which OGs could be relevant to the theme chosen.\nThe activities of the thematic network should complement with those organised by the EU CAP Network [6] .\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating advisors, farmers and/or foresters and/or rural actors in the identification of the most urgent needs from practice as well as in the planning and execution of the main tasks of the thematic network.\nThe resulting project should run for a minimum of 3 years. An initial plan on how the thematic network and its outputs will be updated and maintained in the long-term beyond the projects duration should be included in the proposal.\nThe consideration of social diversity (including gender and other categories) in the dissemination activities of the thematic networks is encouraged.\n[1] AKIS is defined in Article 3(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115\n[2] An “(end-)user” of R&I result(s) is a person who is him/herself putting the results into practice (i.e. practitioner); depending on the theme of the thematic networks, end-users could be farmers and/or foresters and/or other rural actors, or all of them.\n[3] i.e., beyond the duration of the thematic network.\n[4] Including CAP-funded EIP-AGRI operational groups innovation projects, Horizon-funded R&I projects and other R&I activities beyond those funded under CAP and EU R&I programmes\n[5] A theme already covered by a finished thematic network(s) is not allowed, unless the added value of the thematic network proposal is clearly explained and justified.\n[6] Innovation & knowledge exchange | EIP-AGRI | EU CAP Network\n[7] EU-FarmBook (eufarmbook.eu) & akisconnect | Connecting all EU AKIS actors\n[8] Advisory networks – connecting advisors across the EU | EU CAP Network (europa.eu) , including projects selected under topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-13\n[9] supported under the Rural Development Programmes (RDP) 2014-2022 and the CAP Strategic Plans (CSP) 2023-2027\n[10] Innovation & knowledge exchange | EIP-AGRI | EU CAP Network",

      "scope": "Advisors are best placed to encourage farmers to change their practices that improve the competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of farming. A novelty in the current CAP strategic plans [5] is that advisors should be integrated within the AKIS as well as be impartial, competent and up to date on scientific and innovation developments. They should be able to translate the knowledge and provide concrete, targeted and practical solutions for farmers adapted to specific local circumstances. They should be prepared to provide innovation support services, based on the interactive innovation model. They should also be able to use diverse data sources to analyse the performance of farms over time covering the three dimensions of sustainability and accordingly provide informed, holistic advice to the farmers.\nAgainst this background, proposals should:\n- improve the organisation and concrete services provided by impartial advisors, both public and private, within Member States’ AKIS in a collaborative way, including by (1) ensuring more networked structures, deepening the advisors’ integration into AKIS at EU and national/regional levels, and (2) developing and advancing more effective and interactive working methodologies and tools;\n- improve advisors’ knowledge and skills across the EU in all areas of high interest to practitioners, covering competitiveness and the three dimensions of sustainability in line with all the objectives of CAP, at minimum by (1) enhancing the provision and management of knowledge useful for practice, and the sound thematic organisation and interaction of advisors and other relevant actors within AKIS in knowledge hubs, ensuring stronger links between research, education, advisors and farmers and encouraging the collection, wider sharing and use of available knowledge across the EU; (2) organising a substantial amount of activities to improve collaboration between advisors at the EU/national/regional levels, and enable them to effectively and widely share their knowledge, experience and skills, (3) creating and sharing tools, training courses and informative materials useful for advisors and their clients, as well as developing and applying approach(es) to motivate advisors to participate in and make use of them;\n- improve and support the understanding and implementation of the interactive innovation model by the advisory community acting as innovation support services [6] , including by (1) illustrating it with practical examples, (2) providing methodology and training for continued professional development, and (3) ensuring regular communication of research and innovation needs collected from practice to the relevant AKIS actors;\n- create, regularly update and manage an online platform serving as a reference point for advisors and their clients that includes at minimum: (1) a database of advisors’ contacts and profiles (at least including education, professional experience and specific field(s) of expertise), (2) diverse robust data sources and decision support tools (including tutorials), (3) training courses and informative materials, (4) best practice examples (taking account of the costs and benefits for end-users), and (5) other tools and materials relevant for the target audience. The online platform should integrate the practice-oriented outputs from Horizon and CAP-funded projects useful for advisory services, and its entire content (not only interface) should be translated into all 24 official EU languages.\nProposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with, ensure complementarities, avoid duplication of efforts and use efficiently the outputs and activities of the relevant past, existing and future AKIS projects [7] .\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach'. Minimum 50% of the number of the participants involved in the project should be impartial advisors spending at least half of their time on giving advice to farmers. The partners within the consortium should be well networked with advisors overall and have the capacity to involve as many of the advisors professionally active in providing advice to farmers as possible across the EU into the activities of the project.\nProposals should cover a wide range of impartial advisors working on diverse themes of interest for practitioners from all EU Member States and improve collaboration between them, using the countries’ AKIS structures (including the AKIS Coordination Bodies) as intermediaries. To this end, proposals may involve financial support to third parties to ensure the involvement of advisors from across the whole EU in the activities of the advisory network. Consortia need to define the selection process of the advisors / advisory services and/or other relevant AKIS actors.\nThe project should run for a minimum of seven years. An initial plan for financial sustainability and maintenance of the EU advisory network in the long-term beyond the project duration should be included in the proposal.\n[1] Article 6(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115\n[2] AKIS is defined in Article 3(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115\n[3] To this end strong interaction with AKIS Coordination Bodies organising advice and knowledge flows within their Member States will be necessary and illustrated in the proposal.\n[4] In line with the Article 15(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , Member States shall ensure that the advice given is impartial and that advisors are suitably qualified, appropriately trained and have no conflict of interest. The proposals should aim to support Member States in fulfilling this obligation.\n[5] Article 15 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , Article 15(4)(e) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , Article 127(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115\n[6] e.g., for the creation and implementation of the EIP-AGRI Operational Groups (Article 15(4) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115\n[7] In particular but not exhaustive the projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and CAP:\nadvisory and thematic networks, ATTRACTISS , modernAKIS , i2connect , PREMIERE , EU-FarmBook , the future project to be selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-14, and relevant EIP-AGRI Operational Groups projects (notably on knowledge hubs)",

      "scope": "Knowledge, skills and competences are key enablers for more competitive, sustainable and resilient agriculture [3] . However, there are growing concerns in many EU Member States over the shortages and mismatches of knowledge, skills and competences among the farming community working in the diverse and fast-changing contexts [4] . To be prepared and benefit from the various climate, environmental, technological, socio-economic and other relevant drivers of change, the farming community, specifically farmers, their workforce, and advisors, should be able to learn and use in practice the relevant knowledge, skills, and competences, at the right time and place in a lifelong journey.\nAgainst this background, proposals should:\n- develop, improve and apply methodology to assess and foresee what knowledge, skills and competences farmers, their workforce and advisors currently have and need/will need in the future to improve competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of agriculture in light of the evolving context. This should enable the identification of potential gaps and opportunities for upskilling and reskilling, new LLL activities and methods, and serve as a baseline for future assessments of the actions aimed at enhancing the knowledge, skills and competences.\n- map, assess and explore how farmers, their workforce and advisors are and should acquire knowledge, skills and competences (e.g., methods and tools, timing, frequency and place, incentives, etc.), as well as who is and who should be providing them in order for LLL to be practice-oriented, attractive, effective, timely and up-to-date; take into account also how the 27 Member States designed their CAP interventions related to LLL.\n- investigate how to widely and effectively disseminate new practice-oriented knowledge and innovations, resulting from e.g. diverse research and innovation projects, among farmers, their workforce and advisors; in particular analyse what approaches/tools, communication materials and channels are preferred, trusted and used by farmers, their workforce and advisors; based on the analysis provide toolbox and guidelines;\n- map, assess and compare agricultural LLL, including education and training systems, across the EU and beyond, explore and assess best practices on how to embed the knowledge collected within the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) [5] structures to provide valuable input for LLL, including education and training systems, and provide recommendations for improving LLL, including educational and training systems, in view of making them more effective in supporting the transition to competitive, sustainable and resilient agriculture;\n- co-create, pilot, test, and share new, interactive, effective approaches and tools (e.g., exploring the potential of generative AI and social innovation), to stimulate LLL, increase knowledge flows within AKIS and enable farmers, their workforce and advisors to quick, easy and affordable access to impartial and relevant knowledge, skills and competences supporting their decision-making;\n- explore potential synergies between EU instruments and develop new practical approaches to better connect Horizon-funded projects, EIP-AGRI operational groups projects and Erasmus+ projects to LLL in agriculture, including education and training systems, to maximise the impact of these projects for LLL and promote a more coherent approach to knowledge, skills and competences development;\n- develop and test a system(s) compatible with existing EU-wide initiatives [6] that acknowledge(s) and reward(s) farmers, their workforce and advisors who engage in LLL. The system(s) should include different levels of recognition based on the extent and depth of LLL activity completed, as well as be visible, verifiable, and tied to tangible benefits, providing a strong incentive for continuous learning. The project should also assess how the system(s) can be of benefit for the knowledge, skills and competences development of the farming community.\nProposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to cooperate with project that will be selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-13, ensuring complementarities and avoiding duplication of efforts.\nProposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors, including farmers, advisors, agricultural educators and trainers, and other relevant AKIS actors with relevant knowledge and information, and ensuring inclusive co-creation in order to better understand their current and future needs for knowledge, skills and competences, and co-develop the best approaches to effectively address these needs.\nProposals should consider in the research and innovation activities national/regional and context specificities, evolving farm structures and labour organisation, as well as social diversity in a comprehensive way.
