          "<p>Resilient and strengthened democratic systems, anchored in robust and inclusive political decision-making, will be fundamental in the context of complex and interconnected challenges and threats our citizens and societies are confronted with. As stated in the Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029, \u201cEurope\u2019s future in a fractured world will depend on having a strong democracy and on defending the values that give us the freedoms and rights that we cherish.\u201d<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>The Strategic Foresight Report 2023<sup>[2]</sup> already recalled how \u201cdisenfranchisement, growing discontent, and the lack of a positive agenda combine into an erosion of trust in public institutions, polarisation, and an enhanced appeal of extremist, autocratic, or populist movements\u201d and how \u201cdemocracy is increasingly challenged as the governance model best suited to deal with growing socio-economic issues.\u201d The report acknowledged that even \u201cin the EU, some of the core requirements for a functioning democracy are impaired.\u201d A democratic impairment manifested in several phenomena like \u201cchallenges to the rule of law, and an increasing silent citizenship, e.g. a consistent decrease of electoral turnout in many Member States in both national and European elections, or the growing lack of interest in general democratic life [...] the personalisation of politics, with political leaders considered more important than political parties, [\u2026] polarisation of the political debate and the sense of isolation [\u2026] amplified by mis- and disinformation, group dynamics in social media, or algorithmic bias.\u201d</p><p>Social sciences and humanities research is critical for effectively addressing those challenges. While science will provide knowledge, insights and theoretical frameworks, the involvement of stakeholders on the ground (community organisations, policymakers, civil society representatives, among others) is determinant for facilitating the uptake and impact of research results and therefore encouraged in this destination. This collaborative approach ensures that research is based on real-world experiences and needs, leading to more effective and relevant outcomes.</p><p>By addressing key societal challenges through this inclusive methodology, the impact of research on citizens\u2019 lives will be enhanced. For instance, promoting gender equality and protecting minority rights are not only academic endeavours but necessities that reinforce social cohesion and justice. Research findings can shape legislation, drive social innovations, and support the development of initiatives that directly benefit communities. Research contributes to the development of democratic systems that are more inclusive, flexible and adaptable to change. By considering a wide range of views and experiences, policies and institutions are better able to address the needs of all citizens, increasing social fairness.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u>:</p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reinvigorating democratic governance by improving the accountability, transparency, effectiveness and trustworthiness of institutions and policies based on rule of law, and through the expansion of active and inclusive citizens\u2019 participation and engagement empowered by the safeguarding of fundamental rights.</li> </ul><p>The aim of the research investment supporting this impact is to develop a robust evidence base on which to build effective, relevant and sensitive policies that bolster the resilience of democratic systems and protect them from threats.</p><p>The expected impact will be achieved by generating new knowledge and understanding, and developing strategies, methods and innovative solutions, as well as policy recommendations, under the following three areas:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li><strong>GLOBAL CHALLENGES - Fostering democracy and promoting EU values in times of geopolitical shifts and global poly-crisis</strong>, including: effectiveness of science diplomacy as a way to strengthen multilateral cooperation; balancing ethical foreign policy with economic and security interests in foreign countries; disinformation and Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI), as a tool of warfare; EU enlargement and neighbourhood policies to better understand the mechanisms to promote democratisation and the attainment of the EU <em>acquis,</em> fundamental values and the rule of law.</li><li><strong>RESILIENT DEMOCRACIES \u2013 Increasing the resilience of democracy in the face of external and internal threats</strong>, including: nature of extremism and drivers of radicalisation, polarisation and hate speech, (such as xenophobia, racism or misogyny); autocratic and anti-democratic tendencies in the EU; violence and conflict in society with a focus on politically motivated violence (incl. antisemitism); balance between protecting free speech and implementing necessary regulation of it; public misconceptions towards EU enlargement.</li><li><strong>AGILE INSTITUTIONS &amp; INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES \u2013 Modernise democratic institutions and public sector processes for the 21<sup>st</sup> century</strong>, including: innovative public administration and new ways to guarantee quality and incisiveness of public administration (through an indirectly managed action); trust in governance and the Rule of Law, including independence and efficiency of the judiciary; ecosystem-based approach to public decision- and policymaking, combined with foresight and anticipatory governance.</li> </ol><p>The destination will seek synergies with other relevant EU programmes, in particular for the uptake of research results and innovative solutions developed under Horizon Europe. Interaction \u2013 among others \u2013 with the following programmes is encouraged: Digital Europe (DIGITAL), Technical Support Instrument, CERV (Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values), Erasmus+, ESF+ and Global Europe: Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the services offered by the current and future EU-funded European Research Infrastructures, particularly those in the social sciences and humanities domain<sup>[3]</sup>. Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this destination is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>To maximise the impacts of R&amp;I under this Destination in line with EU priorities, international cooperation will be encouraged whenever relevant in the proposed topics.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Political Guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029, <a href=\"https://europa.eu/!wywg4P\">https://europa.eu/!wywg4P</a>. p. 23</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23_en.pdf\">https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/SFR-23_en.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>For a full list see <a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ri-portfolio/table\">https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ri-portfolio/table</a>.

Generations after the end of the Shoah, antisemitism is worryingly on the rise, in Europe and beyond, especially since the turn of the 21st century<sup>[2]</sup>\ufffc. <sup>[3]</sup>\ufffc, the Commission calls \"for action, for all Europeans, to ensure that Europe is a place where our founding values are enjoyed by everyone, on an equal basis.\u201d Antisemitism is incompatible with Europe\u2019s core values. It represents a threat not only to Jewish communities and to Jewish life, but to an open and diverse society, to democracy and the European way of life. The European Union is determined to put an end to it.</p><p>The third pillar of the Strategy covers \u201cEducation, research and Holocaust remembrance\u201d for a Europe that remembers its past and looks into the future through research and education. In this context, an independent expert report was commissioned in 2022 to assess the need to create a research hub on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life and deliver recommendations<sup>[4]</sup>.<sup> </sup></p><p>The goal of this action is to establish a research hub in the shape of a network of researchers on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life in Europe, bringing together a critical mass of such actors in Europe, from Member States and Associated Countries representing the different parts of Europe. Such a hub should foster the research field\u2019s identity and support training and career opportunities for researchers in the field, with a focus on early career researchers. Indeed, the hub\u2019s primary objectives should be to help recruit, train and retain expert capacity in research on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life, and to help ensure that research generated by the field can be used to help formulate policy, at national and European levels.</p><p>One of the key expected outcomes is to prepare the sustainability of the hub. That includes exploring and eventually securing further regional, national and European funding, including (but not restricted to) a possible development into a permanent research infrastructure or European partnership. Proposals should demonstrate the capacity of the consortium to secure funding beyond the project\u2019s lifetime.</p><p>In practical terms, the hub should be embedded within an appropriate existing research community\u2013 to help manage the practicalities of the work and to ensure optimal synergy with the field as it is currently constructed. It should provide opportunities for members to meet in person (in the shape of conferences, seminars, events etc) across geographical Europe. It should have a governance structure that includes an executive board comprised of leading research and policy specialists in the field, a permanent professional secretariat, and be supported by professionals in the areas of social research and policy, training, event management and communications. The hub should have a strong online presence to support its objectives, which should be focused on promoting the field and drawing in students, researchers and policymakers who have an interest in it.</p><p>In the long term (5 to 10 years), the hub is expected to contribute to stimulating interest in the field and attracting talents at all career stages. Among possible actions, it could oversee an internship programme for postgraduate researchers and/or start a summer school program. It is also encouraged that it builds a programme to help establish and distribute research grants for PhDs in contemporary antisemitism and in Jewish life, as well as smaller training grants for researchers at all levels to develop methodological, policy development and knowledge transfer expertise. </p><p>For more senior scholars, the hub is expected, also in the long term, to help create new academic positions focused exclusively on contemporary antisemitism and on specific aspects of European Jewish life (history, sociology, education, literary/media studies, demography, culture, heritage, etc.) and to provide the space for these position-holders to network together, in order to increase the impact of the research. In order to improve retention and growth in the field, the hub should establish (in the long term) at least one annual prize for an outstanding established scholar in the field and for an early career researcher, to help give prominence to the field and encourage new and existing research specialists. In addition, the hub could for instance, in the long term, work with major foundations operating in countering antisemitism and in fostering European Jewish life, promote initiatives that help make existing field research accessible to researchers and policymakers, and offer grants to Jewish community organisations in Europe to fund specific research projects.</p><p>The hub should act as an interface between research (including SSH disciplines) and policy. Consequently, it should organise at least one international conference gathering researchers, community leaders and policymakers. It is strongly encouraged to set up an annual conference that should continue running beyond the end of this action. In addition, it should publish annual reports summarizing the new research and research trends in the field in a format accessible and useful to policymakers. </p><p>Given the global dimension of antisemitism, international cooperation is encouraged.</p><p>Applicants to this topic are encouraged to consider the data offered by European Research Infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities domain, in particular EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure)<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Given the level of ambition of the goals to be achieved, the project should have a minimum duration of 36 months.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Text of the strategy available here: <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/s/zXwi\">https://op.europa.eu/s/zXwi</a>.
