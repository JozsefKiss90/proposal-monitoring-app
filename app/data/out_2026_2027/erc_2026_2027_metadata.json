Open Science: </h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Under Horizon Europe, all beneficiaries (including those of ERC grants) must ensure immediate open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. Open access must be provided with full re-use rights. Beneficiaries must ensure that they or the authors retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with their open access requirements. Publishing costs can be considered as eligible costs provided that the publishing venue (e.g., journal, book) is fully open access.</p><p>In addition, beneficiaries of ERC grants funded under this Work Programme will be covered by the provisions on research data management as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. In particular, whenever a project generates research data, beneficiaries are required to manage it in line with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability as described by the ‘FAIR principles’ initiative, and establish a data management plan within the first six months of project implementation. Open access to research data should be ensured under the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. These provisions are designed to facilitate access, re-use and preservation of the research data generated during the ERC-funded research work.</p></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><h4>Specific conditions</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/information-for-applicants_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information for Applicants to the Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/experts/guide-for-peer-reviewers_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guide for Peer Reviewers - Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/erc-rules-for-submission-and-evaluation_he-erc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Rules of Submission and Evaluation under Horizon Europe</a></p></div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-erc-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE ERC COG)</a></p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a> </p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ:L_202402509\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Grants AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Online Manual</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/ftp/tc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/legalnotice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Privacy Statement</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a></p></div></div>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Up to eight prizes will be awarded under this work programme of a value of EUR 10 000 each.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>With the ERC Public Engagement with Research Award, the ERC wishes to reward outstanding science communicators among its Principal Investigators who successfully engage audiences outside their domain with ERC-funded research. The purpose of award is also to recognise good practice in science communication and to encourage more ERC grantees to develop public engagement activities.</p><p>For the purposes of this prize, public engagement is defined as the involvement of the public in the design, conduct, or dissemination of activities funded by the ERC. Engagement is a two-way process, involving interaction and mutual understanding for mutual benefit.</p><p>The public engagement activities may include, for example:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Citizen science activities conducted in collaboration or consultation with the public at any stage of the frontier research project, from design to implementation. Citizen science initiatives comprise activities such as public consultations or citizen juries.</li><li>Public outreach activities putting the spotlight on a research topic by disseminating its content, promoting discussion, or inspiring potential future researchers. Public outreach initiatives can consist of diverse activities, such as art and science projects, educational programmes, exhibitions, and can include diverse audiences and venues such as students, schools, museums, or science festivals.</li><li>Activities that foster consultation and exchange with citizen groups to raise awareness on a topic, to address a societal challenge, or to contribute to an issue in the public debate. These activities can be undertaken based on preliminary or final project results, as well as any particular result or output generated in the context of an ERC frontier research project. Examples of people and organisations that are likely to be engaged include journalists, policy makers at regional, national, or international level, non-governmental organisations, citizen or patient groups, product users.</li> </ul>"

An overview is provided below:</p><p><strong>Evaluation criterion</strong></p><p>For all the main grants, <strong>excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation</strong>. The panels will primarily evaluate: the ground-breaking nature and ambition of the research project and, at the same time, the intellectual capacity and creativity of the Principal Investigator, with a focus on the extent to which the PI has the required scientific expertise and capacity to successfully execute the project. The detailed evaluation elements applying to the excellence of the research project and the Principal Investigator are set out in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a>.&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Evaluation procedure</strong></p><p>The proposal is evaluated in two steps with interviews taking place at Step 2. The evaluation is carried out by peer review panels as listed in <em>Annex 1</em> of the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a>. The panels may be assisted by independent external experts working remotely.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Evaluation Outcome</strong></p><p>At the end of Step 1 of the evaluation, each proposal receives one of the following scores:</p><p>·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<strong>A invited:</strong> the proposal is of excellent quality and ranked sufficiently high to pass to Step 2 of the evaluation;</p><p>·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<strong>A not invited</strong>: the proposal is of excellent quality but not ranked sufficiently high to pass to Step 2 of the evaluation;</p><p>·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<strong>B:</strong> the proposal is of high quality but not sufficient to pass to Step 2 of the evaluation;</p><p>·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<strong>C</strong>: the proposal is not of sufficient quality to pass to Step 2 of the evaluation.</p><p>At the end of Step 2 of the evaluation, the proposal receives one of the following scores:</p><p><strong>A:</strong> the proposal fully meets the excellence criterion and is recommended for funding should sufficient funds be available;</p><p><strong>B:</strong> the proposal meets some but not all elements of the excellence criterion and will not be funded.</p></div></div><div><h4>Indicative timeline for evaluation and grant agreement: &#xa0;</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Please refer to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a> under the heading <em>'Table 1: Provisional Details on the Main Calls for Proposals under Work Programme 2026’</em>.</p></div></div><div><h4>6. Legal and financial set-up of the grants</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>During the grant preparation stage, the consortium will be asked to prepare the grant agreement, together with the EU project officer. This grant agreement will set out the framework for the grant and its terms and conditions, particularly concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The applicable model with the complete text of the provisions is available on the topic page, together with the other call documentation.</p><p>Please refer to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MGA used for ERC actions under Horizon Europe (HE General MGA)</a>.</p></div></div><div><h4>7. Open Science:</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Under Horizon Europe, all beneficiaries (including those of ERC grants) must ensure immediate open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. Open access must be provided with full re-use rights. Beneficiaries must ensure that they or the authors retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with their open access requirements. Publishing costs can be considered as eligible costs provided that the publishing venue (e.g., journal, book) is fully open access.</p><p>In addition, beneficiaries of ERC grants funded under this Work Programme will be covered by the provisions on research data management as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. In particular, whenever a project generates research data, beneficiaries are required to manage it in line with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability as described by the ‘FAIR principles’ initiative, and establish a data management plan within the first six months of project implementation. Open access to research data should be ensured under the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. These provisions are designed to facilitate access, re-use and preservation of the research data generated during the ERC-funded research work.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/information-for-applicants_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information for Applicants to the Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/experts/guide-for-peer-reviewers_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guide for Peer Reviewers - Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/erc-rules-for-submission-and-evaluation_he-erc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Rules of Submission and Evaluation under Horizon Europe</a></p></div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-erc-stg_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE ERC STG)</a></p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a></p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ:L_202402509\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Grants AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Online Manual</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/ftp/tc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/legalnotice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Privacy Statement</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a></p></div></div>"

An overview is provided below:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation procedure</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A single submission of the full proposal will be followed by a three-step evaluation, including interviews of all the Principal Investigators. The evaluation will be conducted by means of a structure of dedicated panels. The panels may be assisted by independent external experts working remotely.&#xa0;The composition of the panels at each step is not predefined but will be decided dynamically in relation to the proposals received.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The applicant Corresponding Principal Investigator can request on behalf of the group&#xa0;during the electronic proposal submission that up to four specific persons should not act as an evaluator in the evaluation of their proposal.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 1</u>: One panel is formed with approximately 90 panel members, including 5 chairs, who will assess&#xa0;the extended synopsis&#xa0;of the scientific proposal (only Part I - and not the full scientific proposal) and the Principal Investigators’ CVs and track records.&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 2 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 1 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to seven times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 2</u>: Panel members from step 1 will be divided in panels of comparable sizes. They will assess&#xa0;the complete version of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II).&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 3 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 2 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to three times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 3</u>:&#xa0;The interview panels (that may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals) will&#xa0;assess&#xa0;the complete version of the most competitive of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II) and&#xa0;all their Principal Investigators may be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For all ERC frontier research grants,&#xa0;<strong>scientific excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation</strong>. The panels will primarily evaluate:</p><ul><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the ground-breaking nature and ambition&#xa0;of the research project.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the same time, the panels will evaluate:</p><ol><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the intellectual capacity, creativity, and commitment of the Principal Investigators, with a focus on the extent to which the Principal Investigators have the required scientific expertise and capacity to successfully execute the project.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The peer reviewers will need to see that the collaborative working arrangements between the Principal Investigators described as part of the research methodology, can ensure scientific excellence.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The aim is to provide support for a small group of <strong>two to four Principal Investigators to jointly address</strong> <strong>ambitious research problems that could not be addressed by the individual Principal Investigators and their teams working alone</strong>. Synergy projects should enable substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, stemming, for example, from the cross-fertilization of scientific fields, from new productive lines of enquiry, or new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. The transformative research funded by Synergy Grants should have the potential of becoming a benchmark on a global scale.</p><p>Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal. Principal Investigators must also demonstrate that their group can successfully bring together the scientific elements necessary to address the scope and complexity of the proposed research question.</p><p>One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator. At any one time, one Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant Group except the Corresponding one can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.</p><p><strong><em>Size of ERC Synergy Grants</em></strong></p><p>Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of <strong>EUR 10 000 000</strong> for a period of <strong>6 years</strong>. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.</p><p>Additional funding up to <strong>EUR 4 000 000 * </strong>can be requested to cover further eligible costs (e.g. start-up costs, major equipment, access to large facilities, major experimental and field work costs) when these are necessary to carry out the proposed work. The requests for additional funding must be duly justified in the proposal.</p><p><strong><em>Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators</em></strong></p><p>The 'Synergy Grant Group' applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators with competitive track records and, as necessary, their teams.</p><p>Each of the Principal Investigators must present in the proposal a Curriculum Vitae and a Track Record as appropriate to their career stage.</p><p>For further information, please see the ERC Work Programme 2026.</p>"

Evaluation:</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The conditions specific for ERC are described in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026&#xa0;</a>under the heading 'Evaluation criterion and procedure' and in the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/erc-rules-for-submission-and-evaluation_he-erc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Rules of Submission and evaluation under Horizon Europe</a>. An overview is provided below:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation procedure</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A single submission of the full proposal will be followed by a three-step evaluation, including interviews of all the Principal Investigators. The evaluation will be conducted by means of a structure of dedicated panels. The panels may be assisted by independent external experts working remotely.&#xa0;The composition of the panels at each step is not predefined but will be decided dynamically in relation to the proposals received.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The applicant Corresponding Principal Investigator can request on behalf of the group&#xa0;during the electronic proposal submission that up to four specific persons should not act as an evaluator in the evaluation of their proposal.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 1</u>: One panel is formed with approximately 90 panel members, including 5 chairs, who will assess&#xa0;the extended synopsis&#xa0;of the scientific proposal (only Part I - and not the full scientific proposal) and the Principal Investigators’ CVs and track records.&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 2 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 1 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to seven times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 2</u>: Panel members from step 1 will be divided in panels of comparable sizes. They will assess&#xa0;the complete version of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II).&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 3 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 2 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to three times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 3</u>:&#xa0;The interview panels (that may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals) will&#xa0;assess&#xa0;the complete version of the most competitive of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II) and&#xa0;all their Principal Investigators may be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For all ERC frontier research grants,&#xa0;<strong>scientific excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation</strong>. The panels will primarily evaluate:</p><ul><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the ground-breaking nature and ambition&#xa0;of the research project.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the same time, the panels will evaluate:</p><ol><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the intellectual capacity, creativity, and commitment of the Principal Investigators, with a focus on the extent to which the Principal Investigators have the required scientific expertise and capacity to successfully execute the project.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The peer reviewers will need to see that the collaborative working arrangements between the Principal Investigators described as part of the research methodology, can ensure scientific excellence. The detailed evaluation elements applying to the excellence of the research project and the group of Principal Investigators are set out in the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a>.&#xa0;</p></div></div><div><h4>5.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The aim is to provide support for a small group of <strong>two to four Principal Investigators to jointly address</strong> <strong>ambitious research problems that could not be addressed by the individual Principal Investigators and their teams working alone</strong>. Synergy projects should enable substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, stemming, for example, from the cross-fertilization of scientific fields, from new productive lines of enquiry, or new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. The transformative research funded by Synergy Grants should have the potential of becoming a benchmark on a global scale.</p><p>Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal. Principal Investigators must also demonstrate that their group can successfully bring together the scientific elements necessary to address the scope and complexity of the proposed research question.</p><p>One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator. At any one time, one Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant Group except the Corresponding one can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.</p><p><strong><em>Size of ERC Synergy Grants</em></strong></p><p>Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of <strong>EUR 10 000 000</strong> for a period of <strong>6 years</strong>. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.</p><p>Additional funding up to <strong>EUR 4 000 000 * </strong>can be requested to cover further eligible costs (e.g. start-up costs, major equipment, access to large facilities, major experimental and field work costs) when these are necessary to carry out the proposed work. The requests for additional funding must be duly justified in the proposal.</p><p><strong><em>Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators</em></strong></p><p>The 'Synergy Grant Group' applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators with competitive track records and, as necessary, their teams.</p><p>Each of the Principal Investigators must present in the proposal a Curriculum Vitae and a Track Record as appropriate to their career stage.</p><p>For further information, please see the ERC Work Programme 2026.</p>"
