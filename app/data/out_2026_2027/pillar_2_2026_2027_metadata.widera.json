          "<p>The ERA Communication established the need to improve access to excellence as one of the four main strategic goals. Striving towards excellence requires a stronger R&amp;I system where best practice is disseminated faster across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union’s R&amp;I system needs to promote a more inclusive approach in which all can participate and from which all can benefit. Existing disparities between R&amp;I leading and lagging countries should be tackled by introducing structural policy reforms. Closer links between research and innovation and institutional cooperation to produce high-quality knowledge are key to help bridge these disparities. By building on their pockets of excellence and connecting them to broader networks of excellence countries will be able to upgrade their R&amp;I systems, and allow the European Union as a whole to advance together.</p><p>This destination will deploy a portfolio of complementary actions to build up and strengthen R&amp;I capacities in Widening countries enabling them to advance to the competitive edge at European and international level.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Synergy action for Teaming Centres of Excellence (CoE) responds to the need to ensure the sustainability of CoE funded under the Teaming calls<sup>[1]</sup>. The establishment of CoE in Widening countries, supported by a significant investment in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, has created new opportunities for scientific, societal, and economic impact. However, to fully capitalise on this investment and enhance the sustainability and international competitiveness of these CoE, it is essential to facilitate stronger collaboration and strategic joint initiatives among them.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Stronger long-term collaboration among Teaming CoE through structured joint initiatives and clustering efforts to enhance mutual learning, resource sharing, and collective research and innovation capacity;</li><li>Strategic transformation of R&amp;I systems by enhancing institutional cooperation and supporting structural reforms at national and regional levels;</li><li>Promotion of multidisciplinary and transnational cooperation that will enable CoE to address critical European and global challenges, and EU policy priorities;</li><li>Promote ERA priorities such as responsible AI usage, knowledge valorisation, commercialization, and entrepreneurial activities, such as SMEs and start-ups, within the CoE to maximise economic and societal impact;</li><li>Stronger visibility of CoE and their recognition at national, regional, and European levels through structured engagement with industry, policymakers, and society;</li><li>Improved synergies between CoE and national and EU programmes to leverage additional funding opportunities and policy support.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The call topic aims at fostering collaboration among Teaming Centres of Excellence, both existing ones and those resulting from ongoing or future calls, in view of supporting their efforts towards sustainability and increased impact at the regional, national and European level.</p><p>Proposals are expected to include at least the following activities:</p><p><strong>Strategic Clustering for thematic collaboration:</strong> Conducting an in-depth analysis of CoE capacities, research domains, innovation potential, and their role in national and regional quadruple helixes. The aim is to define strategic clusters addressing common research and innovation challenges, supporting EU priorities, and contributing to policy reforms.</p><p><strong>Pilot implementation of thematic clusters:</strong> Establish clusters and support the coordinated implementation of activities, building e.g. on geographically distributed research capacities and infrastructures, interdisciplinary research collaborations, policy support for national and/or institutional R&amp;I reform, or entrepreneurship-focused activities.</p><p><strong>Capacity building for knowledge valorisation:</strong> Offering specialised training, peer learning, expert coaching, and workshops to improve CoE expertise in knowledge valorisation.</p><p><strong>Networking and matchmaking:</strong> Organising dedicated matchmaking events, policy forums, and startup pitching events to connect CoE with industry, investors, and policymakers, supporting their market outreach and strategic partnerships.</p><p><strong>Teaming online platform:</strong> Developing a digital networking platform to improve cooperation among CoE, provide access to shared resources, showcase success stories, and facilitate continuous interaction between research institutions, industry, and policymakers.</p><p><strong>Teaming conference:</strong> Establish the conference as an internationally recognized event, stimulating cross-fertilization of scientific ideas, promoting industry-academia collaborations, attracting international talents and rewarding early-career researchers through Teaming awards.</p><p><strong>Entrepreneurship and tech transfer support:</strong> Encouraging the creation of spin-offs and start-ups, licensing opportunities, and investment-readiness initiatives to ensure research outputs lead to marketable innovations.</p><p>To achieve the expected outcomes, the consortium is expected to provide a comprehensive range of expertise commensurate with the proposed activities. A core of the consortium should be able to demonstrate successful implementation of sustainability strategies of a Teaming CoE. Complementary members of the consortium can provide specific expertise on e.g. communication, training, knowledge valorisation and IPR issues. The consortium should to demonstrate a geographical coverage of its activities that is able to reach all past, existing and future Teaming CoEs that wish to participate in the activities and benefit from the services offered by the consortium. The consortium is encouraged to maximise the use of existing services and facilities, such as the Widening Dissemination and Exploitation Support Facility, to avoid duplication and creation of competing services.</p><p>In order to assess the efficient and effective implementation of the proposed activities a set of key performance indicators tailored to the objectives of the action should be outlined in the proposal.</p><p>The duration of this action should be 5 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In June 2022, the European Court of Auditors in its report recommended the Commission to ensure the sustainability of the Teaming Centres of Excellence.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Synergy action for Teaming Centres of Excellence (CoE) responds to the need to ensure the sustainability of CoE funded under the Teaming calls<sup>[1]</sup>. The establishment of CoE in Widening countries, supported by a significant investment in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, has created new opportunities for scientific, societal, and economic impact. However, to fully capitalise on this investment and enhance the sustainability and international competitiveness of these CoE, it is essential to facilitate stronger collaboration and strategic joint initiatives among them.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Stronger long-term collaboration among Teaming CoE through structured joint initiatives and clustering efforts to enhance mutual learning, resource sharing, and collective research and innovation capacity;</li><li>Strategic transformation of R&amp;I systems by enhancing institutional cooperation and supporting structural reforms at national and regional levels;</li><li>Promotion of multidisciplinary and transnational cooperation that will enable CoE to address critical European and global challenges, and EU policy priorities;</li><li>Promote ERA priorities such as responsible AI usage, knowledge valorisation, commercialization, and entrepreneurial activities, such as SMEs and start-ups, within the CoE to maximise economic and societal impact;</li><li>Stronger visibility of CoE and their recognition at national, regional, and European levels through structured engagement with industry, policymakers, and society;</li><li>Improved synergies between CoE and national and EU programmes to leverage additional funding opportunities and policy support.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The call topic aims at fostering collaboration among Teaming Centres of Excellence, both existing ones and those resulting from ongoing or future calls, in view of supporting their efforts towards sustainability and increased impact at the regional, national and European level.</p><p>Proposals are expected to include at least the following activities:</p><p><strong>Strategic Clustering for thematic collaboration:</strong> Conducting an in-depth analysis of CoE capacities, research domains, innovation potential, and their role in national and regional quadruple helixes. The aim is to define strategic clusters addressing common research and innovation challenges, supporting EU priorities, and contributing to policy reforms.</p><p><strong>Pilot implementation of thematic clusters:</strong> Establish clusters and support the coordinated implementation of activities, building e.g. on geographically distributed research capacities and infrastructures, interdisciplinary research collaborations, policy support for national and/or institutional R&amp;I reform, or entrepreneurship-focused activities.</p><p><strong>Capacity building for knowledge valorisation:</strong> Offering specialised training, peer learning, expert coaching, and workshops to improve CoE expertise in knowledge valorisation.</p><p><strong>Networking and matchmaking:</strong> Organising dedicated matchmaking events, policy forums, and startup pitching events to connect CoE with industry, investors, and policymakers, supporting their market outreach and strategic partnerships.</p><p><strong>Teaming online platform:</strong> Developing a digital networking platform to improve cooperation among CoE, provide access to shared resources, showcase success stories, and facilitate continuous interaction between research institutions, industry, and policymakers.</p><p><strong>Teaming conference:</strong> Establish the conference as an internationally recognized event, stimulating cross-fertilization of scientific ideas, promoting industry-academia collaborations, attracting international talents and rewarding early-career researchers through Teaming awards.</p><p><strong>Entrepreneurship and tech transfer support:</strong> Encouraging the creation of spin-offs and start-ups, licensing opportunities, and investment-readiness initiatives to ensure research outputs lead to marketable innovations.</p><p>To achieve the expected outcomes, the consortium is expected to provide a comprehensive range of expertise commensurate with the proposed activities. A core of the consortium should be able to demonstrate successful implementation of sustainability strategies of a Teaming CoE. Complementary members of the consortium can provide specific expertise on e.g. communication, training, knowledge valorisation and IPR issues. The consortium should to demonstrate a geographical coverage of its activities that is able to reach all past, existing and future Teaming CoEs that wish to participate in the activities and benefit from the services offered by the consortium. The consortium is encouraged to maximise the use of existing services and facilities, such as the Widening Dissemination and Exploitation Support Facility, to avoid duplication and creation of competing services.</p><p>In order to assess the efficient and effective implementation of the proposed activities a set of key performance indicators tailored to the objectives of the action should be outlined in the proposal.</p><p>The duration of this action should be 5 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In June 2022, the European Court of Auditors in its report recommended the Commission to ensure the sustainability of the Teaming Centres of Excellence.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Twinning actions aim to enhance networking activities between the research institutions and research infrastructures of the Widening countries acting as co-ordinators by linking it with at least two internationally leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning actions intend to raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country and its staff, including strengthening the research management capacity.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved research excellence and capacities in Widening countries closing the research and innovation gap within the European Union;</li><li>Enhanced strategic collaboration between the research institutions or higher education establishments of the Widening countries and at least two internationally leading research institutions or higher education establishments at European Union level;</li><li>Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution, and improved research profile of its staff;</li><li>Strengthened research management capacities of the coordinating institution;</li><li>Development of novel approaches in R&amp;I collaboration with increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of researchers.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Twinning proposals should clearly outline the strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research and innovation as well as the scientific excellence of the partners involved. This strategy should include arrangements for formulating joint research and innovation activities and projects in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new level.</p><p>This should be supported by a comprehensive set of activities such as, but not limited to, short-term staff exchanges, expert visits and short term on-site or virtual trainings, workshops; conference attendance, organisation of joint summer schools, dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.</p><p>Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management capacities of the coordinating institution. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their broader research management capacities as defined in the European Competence Framework for Research Managers<sup>[1]</sup>, including establishing/upgrading a dedicated team within the coordinating institution. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.</p><p>A research and innovation component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant (including the indirect costs) may be included, which should be presented in a dedicated workpackage (WP1) entitled ‘Research component’. At least 50% of the budget for this component should be allocated to the coordinator. A research and innovation component involves the development and implementation of new ideas, methods, or technologies and advances the current state of the art in a particular field by pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creating novel solutions. All training related to research and innovation that advances beyond the state of the art should be budgeted and included in this work package.</p><p>The proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators such as scientific production and peer recognition, collaboration agreements with the non-academic sector, attracting and mobilising investments from the private sector, intellectual property developed, new innovative products or services, number of international students, number of female scientists and their roles in the research institutions.</p><p>The proposal should demonstrate how the leading scientific institutions in the consortium will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased gender equality, inclusiveness and mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists and young researchers including doctoral candidates.</p><p>This action is open for participation of the JRC that can contribute with specific expertise, where relevant, for the development of R&amp;I strategies depending on the R&amp;I domain chosen by the project, technology transfer and IPR management as well as linking up to regional smart specialisation strategy.</p><p>The duration of the Twinning project should be up to 3 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1]  <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/jobs-research/rm-comp-european-competence-framework-research-managers_en\">RM Comp: The European Competence Framework for Research Managers - European Commission</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Twinning actions aim to enhance networking activities between the research institutions and research infrastructures of the Widening countries acting as co-ordinators by linking it with at least two internationally leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning actions intend to raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country and its staff, including strengthening the research management capacity.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved research excellence and capacities in Widening countries closing the research and innovation gap within the European Union;</li><li>Enhanced strategic collaboration between the research institutions or higher education establishments of the Widening countries and at least two internationally leading research institutions or higher education establishments at European Union level;</li><li>Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution, and improved research profile of its staff;</li><li>Strengthened research management capacities of the coordinating institution;</li><li>Development of novel approaches in R&amp;I collaboration with increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of researchers.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Twinning proposals should clearly outline the strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research and innovation as well as the scientific excellence of the partners involved. This strategy should include arrangements for formulating joint research and innovation activities and projects in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new level.</p><p>This should be supported by a comprehensive set of activities such as, but not limited to, short-term staff exchanges, expert visits and short term on-site or virtual trainings, workshops; conference attendance, organisation of joint summer schools, dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.</p><p>Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management capacities of the coordinating institution. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their broader research management capacities as defined in the European Competence Framework for Research Managers<sup>[1]</sup>, including establishing/upgrading a dedicated team within the coordinating institution. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.</p><p>A research and innovation component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant (including the indirect costs) may be included, which should be presented in a dedicated workpackage (WP1) entitled ‘Research component’. At least 50% of the budget for this component should be allocated to the coordinator. A research and innovation component involves the development and implementation of new ideas, methods, or technologies and advances the current state of the art in a particular field by pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creating novel solutions. All training related to research and innovation that advances beyond the state of the art should be budgeted and included in this work package.</p><p>The proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators such as scientific production and peer recognition, collaboration agreements with the non-academic sector, attracting and mobilising investments from the private sector, intellectual property developed, new innovative products or services, number of international students, number of female scientists and their roles in the research institutions.</p><p>The proposal should demonstrate how the leading scientific institutions in the consortium will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased gender equality, inclusiveness and mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists and young researchers including doctoral candidates.</p><p>This action is open for participation of the JRC that can contribute with specific expertise, where relevant, for the development of R&amp;I strategies depending on the R&amp;I domain chosen by the project, technology transfer and IPR management as well as linking up to regional smart specialisation strategy.</p><p>The duration of the Twinning project should be up to 3 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1]  <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/jobs-research/rm-comp-european-competence-framework-research-managers_en\">RM Comp: The European Competence Framework for Research Managers - European Commission</a></p>"

Selected consortia will be invited to submit a grant agreement amendment request of the eligible already funded action.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>At system level, mobilise excellence in the Widening countries, increase visibility of the beneficiaries from the widening countries, improve knowledge circulation, and boost their participation in specific thematic domains;</li><li>At consortium level, open up established networks to new connections and partnerships, improve research excellence of the Widening country’s institutions in specific fields, enlarge outreach of the participants’ R&amp;I actions and provides access to new talent pools;</li><li>At the level of the Widening beneficiary, develop new competencies and skills for working in transnational projects including research management and dissemination and exploitation.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The Hop-on Facility integrates one additional beneficiary from a Widening country to an ongoing project under Pillar 2 or the EIC pathfinder scheme who contributes a relevant task, work package or another visible and distinguishable activity.</p><p>Applications must demonstrate the R&amp;I added value of the new beneficiary for the eligible already selected action. The proposal should include a detailed description of the profile of the new beneficiary and its R&amp;I role and complementarity in the existing project.</p><p>The additional beneficiary and activities should be presented in a dedicated proposal template with the Description of the Action (DOA) of the ongoing action uploaded as an annex. In case of a successful evaluation, the consortia (coordinator) of the eligible already funded action (i.e. relevant existing grant agreement) will be invited to submit an amendment request for accession of the Widening beneficiary, modification of the description of the action. If budget is reserved for the coordinator, the proposal should justify the amounts in terms of integration efforts for the new participant.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Hop-on Facility allows for legal entities from Widening countries to join already funded Horizon Pillar II ‘main’ work programme and EIC Pathfinder collaborative R&amp;I actions, subject to the agreement of the respective consortium and provided that legal entities from such countries are not yet participating as beneficiary, associated partner, or affiliated entity. The scheme aims to improve the inclusiveness of Horizon Europe. Selected consortia will be invited to submit a grant agreement amendment request of the eligible already funded action.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>At system level, mobilise excellence in the Widening countries, increase visibility of the beneficiaries from the widening countries, improve knowledge circulation, and boost their participation in specific thematic domains;</li><li>At consortium level, open up established networks to new connections and partnerships, improve research excellence of the Widening country’s institutions in specific fields, enlarge outreach of the participants’ R&amp;I actions and provides access to new talent pools;</li><li>At the level of the Widening beneficiary, develop new competencies and skills for working in transnational projects including research management and dissemination and exploitation.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The Hop-on Facility integrates one additional beneficiary from a Widening country to an ongoing project under Pillar 2 or the EIC pathfinder scheme who contributes a relevant task, work package or another visible and distinguishable activity.</p><p>Applications must demonstrate the R&amp;I added value of the new beneficiary for the eligible already selected action. The proposal should include a detailed description of the profile of the new beneficiary and its R&amp;I role and complementarity in the existing project.</p><p>The additional beneficiary and activities should be presented in a dedicated proposal template with the Description of the Action (DOA) of the ongoing action uploaded as an annex. In case of a successful evaluation, the consortia (coordinator) of the eligible already funded action (i.e. relevant existing grant agreement) will be invited to submit an amendment request for accession of the Widening beneficiary, modification of the description of the action. If budget is reserved for the coordinator, the proposal should justify the amounts in terms of integration efforts for the new participant.</p>"

Striving towards excellence requires a stronger R&amp;I system where best practice is disseminated faster across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union’s R&amp;I system needs to promote a more inclusive approach in which all can participate and from which all can benefit. Existing disparities between R&amp;I leading and lagging countries should be tackled by introducing structural policy reforms. Closer links between research and innovation and institutional cooperation to produce high-quality knowledge are key to help bridge these disparities. By building on their pockets of excellence and connecting them to broader networks of excellence countries will be able to upgrade their R&amp;I systems, and allow the European Union as a whole to advance together.</p><p>This destination will deploy a portfolio of complementary actions to build up and strengthen R&amp;I capacities in Widening countries enabling them to advance to the competitive edge at European and international level.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Excellent capacities in research management are essential for institutions and national R&amp;I systems to enhance their research excellence and capitalize on their R&amp;I activities in a knowledge-based economy and society. The Research Management Facility aims at providing institutions in Widening countries that want to establish or upgrade their research management capacities with tailored support. The Research Management Facility also advises on an implementation strategy to introduce changes in the institutional set-up, in line with the ERA priorities. However, the action does not provide support for the implementation of the strategy.</p><p>Strong research management ensures effective grant acquisition, resource allocation, compliance with funding regulations, and strategic planning. It supports high-quality research by streamlining administrative processes, facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations, attracting and retaining international high-profile researchers, and optimizing the use of research infrastructures.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Encourage the establishment of stronger research management capacities in Widening countries to enhance their participation in the European Research Area;</li><li>Support institutional reforms in research institutions and national R&amp;I systems to strengthen governance, efficiency, and alignment with European research and innovation priorities;</li><li>Strengthen human capital with entrepreneurial and well-trained research managers;</li><li>Promote and support multidisciplinary and transnational cooperation in the field of research management to foster knowledge exchange, capacity building, and alignment of best practices across institutions and countries;</li><li>Promote of ERA priorities such as research integrity and responsible research and innovation (ethics, public engagement, gender equality, science education, open access) and knowledge valorisation, thereby strengthening the institution’s overall research ecosystem.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This action aims at creating a research management facility to provide support services including trainings to research institutions and their staff in Widening countries that want to establish or upgrade existing capacities and competencies in research management. The project should establish a facility inviting research performing organisations from Widening countries to support them in assessing their needs for excellent research management capacities, and develop implementation plans to improve their institutional and human capacities. The facility may also support successful applicants of ERA Research Manager actions in identifying leading research manager internationally.</p><p>Proposals are expected to cover at least the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the assessment of institutional needs in research management, administration and training in close collaboration with the research performing institutions that express interest in their expertise;</li><li>Support the development of a tailor-made implementation plans to establish or upgrade research management capacities at institutional level;</li><li>Facilitate peer exchange and best practice sharing between Widening countries and more experienced institutions to support sustainable capacity building;</li><li>Deliver training modules for research managers in Widening countries to strengthen their skills and professional competences, in line with the European Competence Framework for Research Managers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Facilitate networking opportunities for research managers from Widening countries at European and international levels, to strengthen peer exchange, promote best practice sharing, and enhance their integration into the broader research management ecosystem.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should provide an estimate on the number of institutions and individuals they target during the action that is commensurate to the requested Union contribution. They should describe how they plan to prioritise their support if the demand exceeds the project’ resources. In their proposals, applicants should demonstrate how they will ensure the full geographical coverage of their activities for all Widening countries including Outermost Regions and the relevant Associated Countries.</p><p>Documentation and reporting on the support provided, their follow-up and impacts are considered key to the Research Management Facility. Proposals should include a methodology on documentation and feedback to the European Commission on the profiles of the institution supported, the support provided including recommendations developed, follow-up actions implemented by the institutions, and impacts achieved. In view of continuous improvement of support, and gathering and communicating of transferable outcomes, adequate dissemination and communication activities need to be part of the activities.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the collective competences and capacities, including relevant experiences in the field that are necessary to carry out the activities and achieve the expected outcomes.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/jobs-research/rm-comp-european-competence-framework-research-managers_en\">RM Comp: The European Competence Framework for Research Managers - European Commission</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Excellent capacities in research management are essential for institutions and national R&amp;I systems to enhance their research excellence and capitalize on their R&amp;I activities in a knowledge-based economy and society. The Research Management Facility aims at providing institutions in Widening countries that want to establish or upgrade their research management capacities with tailored support. The Research Management Facility also advises on an implementation strategy to introduce changes in the institutional set-up, in line with the ERA priorities. However, the action does not provide support for the implementation of the strategy.</p><p>Strong research management ensures effective grant acquisition, resource allocation, compliance with funding regulations, and strategic planning. It supports high-quality research by streamlining administrative processes, facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations, attracting and retaining international high-profile researchers, and optimizing the use of research infrastructures.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Encourage the establishment of stronger research management capacities in Widening countries to enhance their participation in the European Research Area;</li><li>Support institutional reforms in research institutions and national R&amp;I systems to strengthen governance, efficiency, and alignment with European research and innovation priorities;</li><li>Strengthen human capital with entrepreneurial and well-trained research managers;</li><li>Promote and support multidisciplinary and transnational cooperation in the field of research management to foster knowledge exchange, capacity building, and alignment of best practices across institutions and countries;</li><li>Promote of ERA priorities such as research integrity and responsible research and innovation (ethics, public engagement, gender equality, science education, open access) and knowledge valorisation, thereby strengthening the institution’s overall research ecosystem.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This action aims at creating a research management facility to provide support services including trainings to research institutions and their staff in Widening countries that want to establish or upgrade existing capacities and competencies in research management. The project should establish a facility inviting research performing organisations from Widening countries to support them in assessing their needs for excellent research management capacities, and develop implementation plans to improve their institutional and human capacities. The facility may also support successful applicants of ERA Research Manager actions in identifying leading research manager internationally.</p><p>Proposals are expected to cover at least the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the assessment of institutional needs in research management, administration and training in close collaboration with the research performing institutions that express interest in their expertise;</li><li>Support the development of a tailor-made implementation plans to establish or upgrade research management capacities at institutional level;</li><li>Facilitate peer exchange and best practice sharing between Widening countries and more experienced institutions to support sustainable capacity building;</li><li>Deliver training modules for research managers in Widening countries to strengthen their skills and professional competences, in line with the European Competence Framework for Research Managers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Facilitate networking opportunities for research managers from Widening countries at European and international levels, to strengthen peer exchange, promote best practice sharing, and enhance their integration into the broader research management ecosystem.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should provide an estimate on the number of institutions and individuals they target during the action that is commensurate to the requested Union contribution. They should describe how they plan to prioritise their support if the demand exceeds the project’ resources. In their proposals, applicants should demonstrate how they will ensure the full geographical coverage of their activities for all Widening countries including Outermost Regions and the relevant Associated Countries.</p><p>Documentation and reporting on the support provided, their follow-up and impacts are considered key to the Research Management Facility. Proposals should include a methodology on documentation and feedback to the European Commission on the profiles of the institution supported, the support provided including recommendations developed, follow-up actions implemented by the institutions, and impacts achieved. In view of continuous improvement of support, and gathering and communicating of transferable outcomes, adequate dissemination and communication activities need to be part of the activities.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the collective competences and capacities, including relevant experiences in the field that are necessary to carry out the activities and achieve the expected outcomes.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/jobs-research/rm-comp-european-competence-framework-research-managers_en\">RM Comp: The European Competence Framework for Research Managers - European Commission</a></p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This action builds on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2026 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2026). The target group are host organisations located in Widening countries.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following <u>outcomes</u>:</p><p>For supported ERA Fellows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;</li><li>New mind-sets and approaches to R&amp;I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;</li><li>Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;</li> </ul><p>For participating organisations in the Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;</li><li>Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation;</li><li>Stronger R&amp;I capacity and output; better transfer of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>For Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More postdoctoral researchers attracted to Widening countries with competitive grants and attractive working and employment conditions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking cross-border mobility. Applications must be made jointly by the researcher together with a legal entity in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening country.</p><p>ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening country.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills<sup>[2]</sup>, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Charter for Researchers, annexed to the Council recommendation C/2023/1640 of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe (OJ C, C/2023/1640, 29.12.2023), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202301640.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-2018.pdf</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This action builds on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2026 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2026). The target group are host organisations located in Widening countries.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following <u>outcomes</u>:</p><p>For supported ERA Fellows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;</li><li>New mind-sets and approaches to R&amp;I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;</li><li>Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;</li> </ul><p>For participating organisations in the Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;</li><li>Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation;</li><li>Stronger R&amp;I capacity and output; better transfer of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>For Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More postdoctoral researchers attracted to Widening countries with competitive grants and attractive working and employment conditions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking cross-border mobility. Applications must be made jointly by the researcher together with a legal entity in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening country.</p><p>ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening country.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills<sup>[2]</sup>, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Charter for Researchers, annexed to the Council recommendation C/2023/1640 of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe (OJ C, C/2023/1640, 29.12.2023), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202301640.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-2018.pdf</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims to foster effective and sustainable structural institutional changes within R&amp;I organisations in alignment with the ERA priorities. Through financial support to third parties (cascading grants), it will enable a variety of capacity-building activities, such as the provision of tools, resources, guidelines, training, and quality assurance programmes.</p><p>Applicants should select and clearly identify <u>one</u> area being addressed, choosing from the two areas outlined below. Each area is designed to contribute toward the implementation of an ERA policy: Area 1 – ERA Action “Applying equity in open science; Area 2 – ERA Structural Policy “Reforming research assessment”. Proposals should develop the activities outlined for the selected area as well as propose additional activities that contribute to achieving the expected outcomes.</p><p>While focusing on one area, applicants are encouraged to consider synergies with other topics of this Call. For example, applicants that choose Area 1 on non-profit open access publishing models may propose activities linked to research assessment (Area 2 of this topic), peer review (Area 4 of topic HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-06-ERA-02), or reproducibility in research (Area 1 of topic HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-06-ERA-08). Any such synergies should be clearly explained.</p><p>Proposed activities should reach large communities of stakeholders, ensuring a wide geographical coverage, inclusivity, broad participation, and accessibility over the course of the project. Proposals should describe their target group in terms of its scope and size. In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges.</p><p>The conditions for the selection procedures that apply to the open calls for cascading grants are provided in the Horizon Europe General Annexes – Part B.</p><p>Expected project duration is up to 3 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.</p><p><strong>Area 1: Supporting the transition of scholarly societies to non-profit open access publishing models</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome</u>: Proposals under Area 1 will deliver on the impact “A more open, equitable and inclusive research and innovation ecosystem”, contributing to the ERA Action “Applying equity in open science”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Publishing activities of scholarly societies in a range of disciplines and scientific fields have transitioned into non-profit open access publishing models, ensuring broader dissemination of research and more equitable and inclusive access to publishing services by eliminating author fees;</li><li>Improved capacities, skills, and resources for scholarly societies that are essential for transitioning their scientific publishing venues into sustainable, non-profit open access publishing models;</li><li>Greater awareness of and commitment to open science principles and practices among scholarly societies and their underlying communities, support to the reform of research assessment and the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope</u>: Area 1 supports the transition of journals/books/monographs of national and/or European scholarly societies<sup>[2]</sup> into non-profit open access publishing models without author fees.</p><p>At least two thirds of the funding should be allocated as cascading grants to calls for pilot actions, targeting scholarly societies in all six <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2015/10/frascati-manual-2015_g1g57dcb.html\">Frascati</a> fields<sup>[3]</sup> of science and technology. At least one third of the grants should be distributed to scholarly societies in the Humanities/Arts and Social Sciences. The cascading grants are expected to result in 20 to 30 pilot actions. Proposals should take into account results from past and ongoing projects on non-profit institutional open access publishing and related infrastructures<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Consortia should comprise, e.g., scholarly societies, research performing and funding organisations, libraries, non-profit scholarly publishers, and other research-relevant organisations, among others. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities, targeting scholarly societies:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop business models to support sustainable non-profit open access publishing for scholarly societies beyond the project;</li><li>Produce guidelines, training materials and lessons learnt to support capacity-building for such transitions of scholarly societies in the future;</li><li>Launch open call(s) for grants supporting pilot actions for transitioning at least 30 scholarly societies across Europe to open access non-profit publishing models.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 2: Sustainable institutional reforms to improve research assessment systems</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome</u>: Proposals under Area 2 will deliver on the impact “Systemic reform of research assessment through the recognition of the diverse outputs, practices, and activities which maximise the quality and impact of research”, contributing to the ERA Structural Policy “Reforming research assessment”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Institutional changes in research performing and funding organisations (including accreditation and quality assurance agencies) in favour of more responsible research assessment systems in line with the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/\">Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment</a> (ARRA);</li><li>Implementation of Action Plans of signatories of the ARRA;</li><li>Increased awareness and trust among researchers and research organisations about reforms of research assessment.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope</u>: Area 2 aims to support institutional changes, raise awareness, and assess the level of progress made in terms of reforming research assessment, in line with the ARRA. The cascading grants are expected to effect changes in 40-50 institutions of different types and from different geographical areas. Proposals should build on past or ongoing relevant initiatives and projects at European or national level<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Project activities should involve actors such as higher education institutions, research performing and funding organisations, research evaluation agencies, accreditation and quality assurance agencies, notably those engaged in the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/\">CoARA</a> approach. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Launch open call(s) providing grants that support institutional changes for reforming research assessment;</li><li>Develop or reform research assessment and evaluation criteria and processes in alignment with the CoARA Agreement commitments;</li><li>Implement reforms aiming to establish qualitative peer-review at the centre of research assessment practices and to move away from the use of traditional bibliometric journal and publication-based indicators (in particular the Journal Impact Factor and h-index);</li><li>Implement institutional changes in the assessment of research that recognise the diversity of activities and roles of researchers; and, enhance the recognition of diverse research practices as part of assessment systems (e.g., public engagement, citizen science, and science for policy);</li><li>Analyse the outcomes of research assessment reforms and identify relevant barriers and impact indicators, as well as quantify the progress of action plans.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/hrexcellenceaward/european-charter-researchers#the-european-charter-for-researchers\">https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/hrexcellenceaward/european-charter-researchers#the-european-charter-for-researchers</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Scholarly societies (also called learned societies) are organisations dedicated to advancing a specific academic discipline or field of study, set scientific standards, and enable multilingualism and biblio-diversity.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims to foster effective and sustainable structural institutional changes within R&amp;I organisations in alignment with the ERA priorities. It supports the adoption of ERA policies and practices within institutions through capacity-building activities, such as the provision of tools, resources, recommendations, training, and exchange of good practices.</p><p>Applicants should select and clearly identify <u>one</u> area being addressed, choosing from the four areas outlined below. Each area is designed to contribute toward the implementation of an ERA policy: Area 1 – ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&amp;I”; Area 2 – ERA Structural Policy “Strengthening gender equality and inclusiveness in the ERA”; Area 3 and Area 4 – ERA Action “Applying equity in open science”. Proposals should develop the activities outlined for the selected area and propose additional activities that contribute to achieving the expected outcomes.</p><p>While focusing on one area, proposals are encouraged to consider synergies with other topics of this Call. For example, applicants that choose Area 3 on equity and inclusion in open science may propose links to peer-review for scientific publishing (Area 4 of this topic), non-profit open access publishing models (Area 1 of topic HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-06-ERA-01), or reproducibility in research (Area 1 of topic HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-06-ERA-08). Any such synergies should be clearly explained.</p><p>Proposed activities should reach large communities of stakeholders, ensuring a wide geographical coverage, inclusivity, broad participation, and accessibility over the course of the project. Proposals should describe their target group in terms of its scope and size. In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges.</p><p>Expected project duration is 2-3 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.</p><p><strong>Area 1: Capacity booster for ethics and integrity: addressing digital transition and ensuring digital inclusion for all</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Projects under Area 1 will deliver on the impact “A research ethics and integrity ecosystem continually enhanced with robust methodologies that encourage benefit sharing and prevent ethics dumping”, contributing to the ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&amp;I”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A reinforced institutional ethics and integrity framework that supports researchers and ethics and integrity bodies in addressing challenges related to AI and the digitalisation of research, ensuring a high level of protection for children, adolescents, seniors, as well as effective mitigation of new digital vulnerabilities;</li><li>Establishment of multidisciplinary networks, fostering responsible and ethical research in the digital domain;</li><li>Increased awareness of the ethical challenges of digital research and the strategies needed to overcome them.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope</u>: Area 1 aims to promote research ethics and integrity principles while preventing breaches in an increasingly digitalised world by developing ethical guidelines in the EU and beyond to foster institutional change. The objective is to build a robust ethics and integrity framework to help researchers address ethical challenges and prevent and/or mitigate risks of digital exclusion related to the rapid spread of AI and digitalisation in research, while protecting groups in a vulnerable situation, including children.</p><p>Proposals should build on the results of relevant past or ongoing projects at European and/or national level<sup>[1]</sup>. Structured cooperation with the <a href=\"https://embassy.science/wiki/Main_Page\">Embassy of Good Science</a> and relevant European networks should be included<sup>[2]</sup>. Project activities should target researchers, research integrity/ethics committees, European networks in research ethics, research management/integrity offices, ethics officers in research performing organisations, as well as policymakers. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop an institutional ethics and integrity framework based on standard operating procedures and operational guidance;</li><li>Develop training programmes for researchers, ethics experts, and local ethics bodies/committees to safeguard responsible and trustworthy research in a digital context;</li><li>Conduct targeted communication and dissemination actions on ethical challenges in the digital domain in order to build understanding among researchers, developers, and the broader public about risks, and to promote responsible innovation and commitment to the European Charter for Researchers, through activities such as workshops, surveys, public communication campaigns, and tailored ethics dialogues.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 2: Mutual learning and mentoring for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of inclusive gender equality plans </strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Proposals under Area 2 will deliver on the impact “Enhanced gender equality and inclusiveness, leading to research excellence and more innovative, socially relevant, and economically impactful outcomes;”, contributing to the ERA Structural Policy “Strengthening gender equality and inclusiveness in the ERA”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased capacity of R&amp;I organisations to design, implement, monitor and evaluate inclusive gender equality plans (GEPs) through the availability of new or updated methods, guidance and tools;</li><li>Increased uptake, quality and effectiveness of inclusive GEPs and policies in organisations that are less advanced in their implementation, monitoring and evaluation.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope:</u> Area 2 will support the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of inclusive GEPs through a peer-mentoring scheme, matching organisations and teams with a strong track record in developing and implementing inclusive GEPs with those that need guidance, particularly from – but not limited to – countries classified as emerging or moderate innovators by the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/statistics/performance-indicators/european-innovation-scoreboard_en#european-innovation-scoreboard-2024\">EU Innovation Scoreboard</a>.</p><p>Project activities should target research performing organisations, higher education institutions, and public bodies and build on existing knowledge, expertise, and tools<sup>[3]</sup>. Project consortia are expected to justify their collaboration based on their alignment in terms of common challenges, similar contexts and/or specific thematic focus. Proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Implement actions in organisations that are less advanced in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of inclusive GEPs, guided by an intersectional approach, targeting underrepresented or socially disadvantaged groups, integrating gender dimension into R&amp;I content, ensuring thorough monitoring and evaluation of inclusive GEPs, and other measures;</li><li>Exchange good practices and materials tailored to individual organisations’ needs for the development, monitoring and evaluation of inclusive GEPs;</li><li>Build capacities through activities such as on-site visits, training, workshops, and networking with relevant projects, initiatives and stakeholders in the area of gender equality and inclusiveness beyond the project consortia.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 3: Address equity and inclusion in capacities for open science</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Proposals under Area 3 will deliver on the impact “A more open, equitable and inclusive research and innovation ecosystem”, contributing to the ERA Action “Applying equity in open science”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Consolidated evidence base on equity and inclusion in open science;</li><li>Support for researchers with diverse profiles and needs in adopting open science practices, including more equitable access to open science infrastructures;</li><li>Training material for the practice of open science addressing specific equity needs and profiles.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope:</u> Area 3 aims to generate actionable recommendations and toolkits in order to support capacities for open science by prioritising an equitable contribution to, and benefits from, open science through policy and institutional practice.</p><p>Proposals should build on any past or ongoing relevant initiatives and projects at European or national level<sup>[4]</sup>. Project activities should involve actors such as research performing and funding organisations, research assessment agencies, research infrastructures, universities, researchers, innovators, and policymakers. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Take stock of equity and inclusion barriers in relation to open science practices and access to open science infrastructures, notably in connection to scientists’ personal circumstances (like career stage, employment stability and contract type, financial circumstances, country of origin or residence, and factors such as gender, ethnicity);</li><li>Develop and disseminate shared tools, training methods, and services tailored to equity needs, thereby boosting open science skills and capacities in collaboration with stakeholders;</li><li>Support the professionalisation of open science-related profiles, such as data stewards, non-profit academic editors, and non-profit academic journals' reviewers;</li><li>Provide recommendations for developing a common ERA approach to equity in open science in its different practices.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 4: Improving quality, efficiency and equity in peer-review for scientific publishing</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Proposals under Area 4 will deliver on the impact “A more open, equitable and inclusive research and innovation ecosystem”, contributing to the ERA Action “Applying equity in open science”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved quality and increased transparency, recognition, equity, and non-bias in the peer-review process and editorial review system in different disciplines among publishers (including non-profit, institutional, scholarly societies, and commercial publishers) and editors/editorial boards;</li><li>Increased awareness among researchers, research performing organisations, scholarly societies, editors/editorial boards and publishers, of the need for a transparent and equitable peer review process as an integral part of high-quality research.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope</u>: Peer-review has recently come under scrutiny and is being reimagined to better serve scientific integrity, openness, and fairness. To this end, Area 4 aims to contribute towards enhancing its various aspects and to explore different peer-review models.</p><p>Proposals should cover disciplines from at least two of the six <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2015/10/frascati-manual-2015_g1g57dcb.html\">Frascati</a><sup>[5]</sup> fields of science and technology as well as consider the emerging challenge of AI in peer-review. Project activities should involve actors such as editors/editorial boards, scholarly societies, research performing organisations, and national research evaluation agencies. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Pilot policies and processes in different scientific fields that will improve the peer-review process, mindful of the challenges introduced by AI;</li><li>Draft recommendations for transitioning scholarly publishing in different scientific fields to improved, more efficient, transparent, equitable, and non-biased peer-reviewed processes;</li><li>Address new forms of peer-review, such as open peer-review, and innovative publishing models, including “publish-review-curate”, where the review is conducted on publicly available preprints;</li><li>Address attitudes to and effectiveness of peer review practices in different scientific fields, considering geographic, gender, and career stage biases in the process.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Including projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-27-2017/en\">H2020_SwafS-27-2017</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-03-2018/en\">H2020_SwafS-03-2018</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-29-2020/en\">H2020_SwafS-29-2020</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-90/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-90</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-91/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-91</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-91/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-91</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-12/en\">HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-12</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-12/en\">HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-12</a>; See also Cordis Results Pack: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/450170-ethics-and-integrity-building-bridges-for-trust-and-excellence-in-research-and-innovation\">Ethics and integrity: Building bridges for trust and excellence in research and innovation</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>E.g., the European Network of Research Ethics Committees and Research Integrity Offices (<a href=\"https://eneri.eu/\">ENERI</a>), The Anna Lindh Foundation (<a href=\"https://alf.website/en/who-we-are/\">ALF</a>), and the Network of Education on Research Quality (<a href=\"https://community.embassy.science/c/nerq/105\">NERQ</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/toolkits/gear?language_content_entity=en\">GEAR Tool</a>; Projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-13-2018/en\">H2020_SwafS-13-2018</a>,<a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-08-2017/en\">H2020_SwafS-08-2017</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-80/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-80</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-81/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-81</a>, and <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-11/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-11</a> .</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Including project <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824612\">ON-MERRIT</a>, funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-20-2018-2019/en\">H2020_SwafS-20-2018-2019</a>, and projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-44/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-44</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>1) Natural sciences; 2) Engineering and technology; 3) Medical and health sciences; 4) Agricultural and veterinary sciences; 5) Social sciences; 6) Humanities and the arts.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims to promote the adoption of ERA policies and practices, contributing to sustainable ecosystems established around ERA priorities through enhanced cooperation, coordination and alignment. The topic helps to create new or enhance existing ecosystems through activities such as networking and cooperative action, knowledge exchange and dissemination, tools, training, and policy advice.</p><p>Applicants should select and clearly identify <u>one</u> area being addressed, choosing from the three areas outlined below. Each area is designed to contribute toward the implementation of an ERA policy: Area 1 – ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&amp;I”; Area 2 – ERA Structural Policy “Enabling open science via sharing and re-use of data, including through EOSC\"; Area 3 – “Green transition”, as set out in the Pact for R&amp;I in Europe. Proposals should develop the activities outlined for the selected area as well as propose additional activities that contribute to achieving the expected outcomes.</p><p>Project activities should reach large communities of stakeholders, engaging also those beyond academia, ensuring a wide geographical coverage, inclusivity, broad participation, and accessibility over the course of the project. Proposals should describe the target group in terms of its scope and size. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is welcomed. The involvement of entities from non-associated third countries in the consortium must be clearly explained and justified.</p><p>In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges. Where relevant, proposals should consider the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity<sup>[1]</sup> and the TRUST Code<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Applicants must demonstrate in their proposal a viable plan for achieving self-sustainability after the end of the grant agreement, with a clear description of a minimum set of activities that will be maintained by the consortium with own or other resources.</p><p>Expected project duration is up to 3 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.</p><p><strong>Area 1: Equitable, sustainable, and ethical research</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Proposals under Area 1 will deliver on the impact “A research ethics and integrity ecosystem continuously enhanced with robust methodologies and knowledge that encourage benefit sharing and prevent ethics dumping”, contributing to the ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&amp;I”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A reinforced research ethics and integrity ecosystem that supports sustainable and equitable research partnerships across lower- and high-income settings, based on the values of the TRUST Code;</li><li>Enhanced expertise in benefit sharing and practical and effective methods to prevent ‘ethics dumping’;</li><li>Creation of an international community of practice to promote “ethics-by-design\" in support of researchers, research participants, local communities, local/national ethics and research integrity bodies, and other key stakeholders.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope:</u> Area 1 promotes research ethics and integrity principles in an increasingly digitalised world to prevent breaches and address barriers to implementing ethical guidelines in the EU and beyond. The objectives are twofold: first, to reinforce an ecosystem that supports a long-lasting approach to benefit sharing, also accounting for the growing prevalence of AI; and second, to address imbalances in research, especially in high-risk or highly contingent settings, by incorporating due diligence and beneficence for research participants and local communities.</p><p>Proposals should build on the results of relevant past or ongoing projects at European and/or national level<sup>[3]</sup>. Structured cooperation with the <a href=\"https://embassy.science/wiki/Main_Page\">Embassy of Good Science</a> should be included. Cooperation with university or research networks to enrich ethics-related curricula is desirable<sup> </sup><sup>[4]</sup>. Project activities should target researchers, local/national research integrity and ethics committees, European networks of (early career) researchers and educators in research ethics, research management and integrity offices, ethics officers in research performing organisations, as well as policymakers. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should include the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop toolkits to facilitate partnerships that guarantee the premise of ‘do no harm’ as well as fair and just practice from conception to the implementation of actions;</li><li>Develop training programmes, including a quality assurance system, for researchers and for ethics experts and committees to promote the coherence of the ethics review process;</li><li>Increase awareness and disseminate knowledge of ethical values and norms for responsible R&amp;I, including at the local level.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 2: Global cooperation for the uptake of open science practices</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Proposals under Area 2 will deliver on the impact: “A more open, equitable and inclusive research and innovation ecosystem”, contributing to the ERA Structural Policy “Enabling open science via sharing and re-use of data, including through the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)\". Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthened international collaboration for aligning policies and strategies that enable open access, and the secure and trusted sharing and re-use of digital research objects and tools in line with the FAIR principles;</li><li>New standards, recommendations, and methodologies necessary for applying the FAIR principles and supporting the EOSC ecosystem in alignment with global best practices;</li><li>Improved interoperability of digital research objects, tools, and services across various thematic, discipline-specific, and national data and digital research infrastructures worldwide.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope:</u> Area 2 supports efforts to ensure that open science practices and skills are rewarded and taught, becoming the ‘new normal’. The main goal is to foster a global ecosystem that promotes cooperation and alignment on open science practices. It will facilitate the development of standards, tools, and services that empower researchers to find, access, re-use, and combine research findings, especially through EOSC.</p><p>Proposals should build on activities by related projects<sup>[5]</sup> and activities in the context of the EOSC Partnership aimed at fostering the international dimension of EOSC. The project activities should target actors such as research organisations and their associations, research community-driven associations, research infrastructures, service providers, and higher education institutions. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Implement initiatives to facilitate cooperation and connections between developments within the European context and international initiatives that promote the reusability of digital research outputs;</li><li>Engage with international stakeholders to contribute to the development and adoption of globally recognised data practices and standards;</li><li>Provide support for defining and developing EOSC policies and technical specifications by aligning with global, community-driven initiatives and scientific best practices;</li><li>Promote knowledge sharing, capacity building, and skills acquisition, enabling researchers and organisations to actively contribute to open science and the development of Global Open Research Commons.</li> </ul><p><strong>Area 3: Environmentally sustainable science</strong></p><p><u>Expected outcome:</u> Projects under Area 3 will deliver on the impact “Increased uptake, effectiveness and impact of environmentally sustainable research”, contributing to the green transition. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Effective knowledge sharing and support for researchers and R&amp;I organisations in implementing environmentally sustainable practices and policies;</li><li>Enhanced culture and awareness of environmental sustainability within the scientific community;</li><li>Increased integration of environmental sustainability considerations in European and national research funding programmes and other initiatives.</li> </ul><p><u>Scope:</u> Area 3 contributes toward reducing environmental footprint of research. The aim is to set up a network dedicated to driving the transformation of research practices and research organisations toward environmental sustainability, considering various measures, such as energy-efficient, low-waste laboratories, and sustainable data storage and computing facilities. Special attention should be given to energy-intensive digital technologies like AI.</p><p>Proposals should build on existing approaches and methodologies and collaborate with relevant projects, networks and initiatives<sup>[6]</sup>. Project activities should target actors such as higher education institutions, research performing and funding organisations, industry, policymakers, and grassroots initiatives. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Map existing approaches for assessing and reducing environmental footprint and develop sustainability guidelines, considering various disciplines and research contexts;</li><li>Offer evidence-based recommendations to integrate sustainability into research funding and evaluation, with attention to different institutional frameworks and engagement at all institutional levels;</li><li>Promote awareness and adoption of sustainability policies and practices through knowledge exchange, collaboration, and trainings that leverage existing resources and expertise.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://european-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity_horizon_en.pdf\">european-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity_horizon_en.pdf</a><u>.</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>The TRUST Code A Global Code of Conduct for Equitable Research Partnerships, <a href=\"https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/\">https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Including projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-27-2017/en\">H2020_SwafS-27-2017</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-03-2018/en\">H2020_SwafS-03-2018</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-29-2020/en\">H2020_SwafS-29-2020</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-90/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-90</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-91/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-91</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-91/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-91</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-12/en\">HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-12</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-12/en\">HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-12</a>; See also Cordis Results Pack: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/450170-ethics-and-integrity-building-bridges-for-trust-and-excellence-in-research-and-innovation\">Ethics and integrity: Building bridges for trust and excellence in research and innovation</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>For example, EUA, YERUN, LERU, CESAER, EARMA, ALF.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>Projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-04/en\">HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-04</a> and <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-41/en\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-41</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>See for example, <a href=\"https://www.greenlabs-nl.eu/\">Green Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/about-msca/msca-green-charter\">MSCA Green Charter</a>, <a href=\"https://sels-network.org/\">Sustainable European Laboratories</a>, <a href=\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/greening-research/working-group/\">Science Europe Working Group on Greening Research</a>, <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/13938809\">Heidelberg Agreement</a>; ALLEA (2022), “<a href=\"https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ALLEA-Report-Towards-Climate-Sustainability-of-the-Academic-System.pdf\">Towards Climate Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and beyond</a>”; Nature (2024), <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/collections/efibjjgffj\">“Spotlight on Green Labs”</a>; EC (2024) \"<a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/42086c26-e8fe-11ef-b5e9-01aa75ed71a1\">Greening research: Decarbonisation and beyond</a>\".</p>"

The topic supports the objectives of the Startup and Scaleup Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> by fostering the market uptake of innovative solutions.</p><p>Academic startups and spinoffs need access to excellent support services to commercialise their research and bring their innovations to market. Beyond technology validation, there is a need to test the desirability of their products and services with a broader public, learn from citizens’ feedback, and adapt and improve their value propositions to improve their prospects for collaborating with industrial partners, attracting investors, and growing locally and internationally.</p><p>A variety of organisations – such as science parks, technology parks, living labs, hubs, and practitioners in citizen engagement for knowledge valorisation – engage societal actors in experimentation practices that aim to support, at an early stage, the market uptake and growth of university spinoffs and startups. To be effective, such practices need to align with the fast pace of innovation and integrate skills and methods from different areas, drawing also from the social sciences and humanities, and the arts and design. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>At least 20 pilot actions across Europe enabling university spinoffs and technology startups to link up to end-users, societal actors, industry, and other stakeholders to boost market uptake and growth.</li><li>Development of guidance and services, including methodologies and best practices to support spinoffs and startups, where testing and validating their innovative solutions to better fit society and the market is important.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should describe their target group in terms of its scope and size. A wide geographical coverage, inclusivity, broad participation, and accessibility should be ensured. In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges.</p><p>Projects are expected to contribute to the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/eu-valorisation-policy/knowledge-valorisation-platform_en\">EU Knowledge Valorisation Platform</a>, which highlights best practices for knowledge valorisation. Additionally, projects are expected to establish synergies with ongoing projects under the topic “Experimentation and exchange of good practices for value creation”<sup>[2]</sup>, taking their results into account.</p><p>Expected project duration is up to 2 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/jobs-and-economy/eu-startup-and-scaleup-strategy_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/jobs-and-economy/eu-startup-and-scaleup-strategy_en</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-03\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA-01-03</a> and <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-05\">HORIZON-WIDERA-2024-ERA-01-05</a>.</p>"

Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Hundreds of innovative solutions resulting from the co-creation in transdisciplinary teams of researchers and citizens, supported through mentoring, business and technical advice and training to enter the market;</li><li>Upgraded skills for innovation and entrepreneurship among researchers and citizens across Europe, promoting business mindsets and contributing to new business startups that are given exposure and opportunities to grow at European level;</li><li>Increased awareness of societal challenges and R&amp;I for new solutions to address them;</li><li>Increased trust in science and broader use of participatory and citizen engagement approaches to create value for market and society.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic focuses on connecting R&amp;I with citizens and other stakeholders in order to upscale knowledge valorisation, while also contributing to increased trust in science and alignment of R&amp;I with society’s needs, expectations and values.</p><p>It aims to accelerate knowledge valorisation through citizen engagement by driving the co-creation of innovative solutions that address citizens' needs, in joint teams of researchers and citizens, thereby supporting their market uptake.</p><p>The topic will enable researchers and citizens from across Europe to work together in transnational, transdisciplinary teams to address societal challenges through existing research results and to create new businesses to bring their innovative solutions to market. Municipalities, regional and city councils, research organisations, business and innovation centres, and other entities are invited to jointly implement, for three consecutive years (2027-2029), an annual, year-long competition, the “European Citizens’ Hackathon Championship”, with impact at local, regional and European level.</p><p>Each annual competition will consist of a first-phase of hackathons taking place as physical meetings in several locations (cities and communities) across Europe, addressing issues that affect people’s lives. The detailed programme of activities, including the theme of the first annual competition, must be delivered within 3 months of start of the grant agreement and be approved by the granting authority. Subsequent themes will be agreed with the granting authority at the latest in month 14 and 26 of the action.</p><p>The winning teams of these first-phase hackathons will then compete at the European level for the title of European Champion. The total financial award of EUR 60 000 per year will be shared equally among the three winning teams of each annual competition.</p><p>The final event should also engage broad groups of stakeholders, including citizens, researchers, industry, public authorities, investors, and business developers.</p><p>Proposals should describe the plan for rolling out the competition over three consecutive years and supporting winning teams in the uptake of their solutions.</p><p>The three cities hosting the yearly European-level hackathons should be members or associated partners of the consortium. The first-phase hackathons should take place in at least 14 physical locations across Europe and be open to participating teams from all Member States and Associated Countries.</p><p>Wherever possible, synergies should be sought with other programmes such as “Science comes to town”, the European Researchers’ Night, the New European Bauhaus Festival, and others at every step of the championship.</p><p>Physical and digital accessibility should be ensured in all phases of the championship. Particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges, where relevant.</p><p>Expected project duration is up to 4 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The successful proposal will deliver on the impact “Increased alignment of research with society’s needs, expectations and values”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthened capacity, networks and involvement of the participating cities in science communication and citizen engagement in science;</li><li>More informed, evidence-based policymaking and increased public engagement through inclusive and participatory discussions and debates on science and R&amp;I policy;</li><li>Improved attractiveness of diverse careers in R&amp;I for younger generations.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic supports a small group of cities in organising and hosting a joint 1-year programme “Science comes to town 2028”. The programme should have a robust concept and brand focusing on connecting citizens and science while involving all relevant stakeholders (e.g., researchers, research funders, policymakers, publishers, citizens, civil society organisations, and business community).</p><p>Various events and activities should be organised, highlighting the latest R&amp;I developments and their contribution to society (including projects supported by national/regional/EU funds). Applicants should experiment with novel formats that are inclusive and participatory and engage diverse age and social groups at local, regional, and European levels. In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges. Special emphasis should be placed on exploring and supporting citizen science to promote both science education and multiple forms of public engagement with science.</p><p>In addition, the programme of activities should include the following two components:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>EUCYS (European Union Contest for Young Scientists): science competition, awarding prizes and awards, for 14- to 20-year-olds who are first prize winners of national science contests for school science projects.</li><li>EU TalentOn (European Union Contest for Early Career Researchers): science competition, awarding prizes and awards, bringing together at least 100 early-career researchers, 21-35 of age, to work on scientific solutions to societal challenges.</li> </ul><p>The 2028 editions of EUCYS and EU TalentOn will take place in the third quarter of 2028, customarily in September<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to establish synergies with the European Researchers’ Night and the Researchers at School initiative, funded by Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions<sup>[2]</sup>. Programmed activities should create a link with the preceding<sup>[3]</sup> and subsequent edition of “Science comes to town”, fostering cohesion and growth of the initiative.</p><p>The programme should take place in a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6 cities located in at least 3 different Members States and/or Associated Countries, with the majority located in Member States. The consortium can include organisations that can represent the host cities and/or join them in designing and implementing the project activities. Local partners that provide a connection to R&amp;I should be included.</p><p>Applicants should provide commitment letters from the public authorities of each participating city, signed by the highest authorities (such as the mayor or equivalent city governance representative), demonstrating strong commitment for the activities included in the proposal. The proposal should clearly explain how the city will contribute to the initiative and outline its specific roles, resources, and support.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the consortium’s ability to mobilise substantial resources beyond the Union contribution, including monetary or in-kind sponsorships, to support and expand the planned activities. Applicants may choose to further increase the impact and added value by incorporating additional events and activities, financed by other resources, by engaging ‘satellite’ cities to reach more communities. The consortium will report on the implementation of the planned activities and events not covered by the grant but will not report or declare the related costs, in order to limit administrative effort.</p><p>Proposals should include the overall concept for the programmed activities, detailing the focus and scope of activities, the outreach strategy, and the contribution to the long-term vision for the cities, while specifying clearly:</p><p>a) events (including EUCYS and EU TalentOn) and activities (e.g., overall coordination and communication activities) that will be funded partially or fully by the Union contribution;</p><p>b) activities and events that will be financed by the participating cities, ‘satellite’ cities, sponsorship and other resources (i.e., activities not funded by the Union contribution).</p><p>Proposals should present a breakdown of all additional resources. Annexes should be used only for commitment letters, not for extra budget related details.</p><p>The consortium will submit a detailed draft programme of activities for approval by the granting authority, no later than three months prior to the official programme launch.</p><p>The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of prizes to the total amount of €70 000 for EUCYS and €100 000 for EU TalentOn.</p><p>The expected duration of the project is between 24 and 30 months.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>More information can be found on the contest websites (see also specific organisational aspects in the respective background notes), <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eucys_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eucys_en</a><u>;</u> <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eu-talenton_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eu-talenton_en</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/msca-citizens\">https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/msca-citizens</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>See “Science comes to town 2027” in WIDERA work programme 2025 and “Science comes to town 2029” in WIDERA work programme 2026-2027.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This action builds on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2027 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2027). The target group are host organisations located in Widening countries.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following <u>outcomes</u>:</p><p>For supported ERA Fellows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;</li><li>New mind-sets and approaches to R&amp;I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;</li><li>Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;</li> </ul><p>For participating organisations in the Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;</li><li>Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation;</li><li>Stronger R&amp;I capacity and output; better transfer of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>For Widening Countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More postdoctoral researchers attracted to Widening countries with competitive grants and attractive working and employment conditions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking cross-border mobility. Applications must be made jointly by the researcher together with a legal entity in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening country.</p><p>ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening Country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening country.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills<sup>[2]</sup>, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g., commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Charter for Researchers, annexed to the Council recommendation C/2023/1640 of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe (OJ C, C/2023/1640, 29.12.2023), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202301640.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-2018.pdf</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This action builds on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2027 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2027). The target group are host organisations located in Widening countries.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following <u>outcomes</u>:</p><p>For supported ERA Fellows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;</li><li>New mind-sets and approaches to R&amp;I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;</li><li>Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;</li> </ul><p>For participating organisations in the Widening countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;</li><li>Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation;</li><li>Stronger R&amp;I capacity and output; better transfer of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>For Widening Countries:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More postdoctoral researchers attracted to Widening countries with competitive grants and attractive working and employment conditions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking cross-border mobility. Applications must be made jointly by the researcher together with a legal entity in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening country.</p><p>ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening Country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening country.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills<sup>[2]</sup>, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g., commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Charter for Researchers, annexed to the Council recommendation C/2023/1640 of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe (OJ C, C/2023/1640, 29.12.2023), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202301640.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-2018.pdf</p>"
