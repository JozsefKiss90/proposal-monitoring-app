          "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 defines nature restoration objectives in line with target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The EU Nature Restoration Regulation provides that Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards nature restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings to achieve large-scale impact and foster collaboration between sectors and communities.\nProposals should:\n• support the set up of three living labs, with 10 to 20 experimental sites each, as places for testing and demonstrating innovative solutions to restore ecosystems following three main principles: (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users. Transboundary living labs are encouraged and expected to be in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries, with some of them including outermost regions, islands or remote areas. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the living labs and among the stakeholders within the living labs;\n• establish a work plan of activities in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions;\n• establish tools for each living lab to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and to monitor progress towards the objectives. Where relevant, the overall objective should be to reach the favourable reference areas, the good conservation status and the satisfactory levels for indicators at national levels defined in the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive or the Nature Restoration Regulation;\n• monitor and carry out an assessment of both the effectiveness of innovative practices for ecosystem restoration and for their non-deterioration;\n• demonstrate how of the identified innovative solutions can be viable for end-users, by developing suitable business models and testing private or public support schemes such as payment for ecosystems services or nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] ;\n• address challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions, developing a gender-sensitive and inclusive framework on how ecosystem health could support this work;\n• disseminate the newly developed solutions to facilitate their uptake by practitioners;\n• demonstrate how ecosystem restoration can support EU general policy objectives, enhancing societal resilience, and reducing natural risks.\nProposals should focus on ecosystems under one or several of the following groups:\n• Transitional interfaces : Marine-coastal-terrestrial transitional ecosystems such as salt marshes, dunes, estuaries, coastal lagoons, and deltas, as well as freshwater transitions between watershed, rivers, lakes and groundwater.\n• Urban-rural gradient : urban ecosystems -including parks, restored brownfields, urban forests, and green and blue infrastructures-, urban nature with surrounding peri-urban and rural ecosystems.\n• Mosaic agricultural landscapes : agricultural ecosystems with high biodiversity value such as semi-natural grasslands, agroforestry systems, hedgerows, and buffer strips.\n• Biodiversity corridors : linear habitats that cut across multiple land uses, such as riparian vegetation, roadsides, canal banks, and hedgerows. Ecosystem connectivity across fragmented landscapes.\n• Dryland and arid ecosystems : garrigue, maquis, and steppe landscapes facing increasing threats from drought, erosion, desertification, and fire.\nProjects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors may include researchers, land / water managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), local authorities, civil society representatives (e.g., local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations) and/or investors. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g., land managers, SMEs or civil society) can be provided through calls for proposals. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities.\nCooperation is expected with relevant EU-funded projects and with relevant initiatives of the partnership Biodiversa+, and appropriate resources should be foreseen to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. The collaboration with the JRC would address JRC methodologies for ecosystem condition assessment, aligned with the System of Environmental Economic Accounting, and data and indicators identified by JRC to perform the assessment.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex",

Activities are expected to go beyond monitoring, without totally excluding monitoring activities if they are needed to support innovations;\n• engage with diverse local communities and/or indigenous people and consider gender and disability-sensitive and inclusive approaches to ensure equal participation and benefits for all;\n• assess the possible contribution of citizens to overall biodiversity objectives and design and test social incentives that encourage citizens to take an active role in nature conservation and restoration.\nProposals should address some of the following activities:\n• Development, testing and marketing of citizen toolkits for species conservation, with the following scope: animal species across various taxonomic groups, including pollinating and not pollinating insects; protected species or species threatened with extinction according to the European Red List [1] ; species suitable for direct citizen conservation action and with feasible breeding programmes.\nWhere necessary, the toolkit should include material for the creation of a habitat required by targeted species, such as seed material.\n• Pest control or management of invasive species by citizens, in particular to prevent possible negative impacts on habitats and/or species.\n• Social innovation leading to new services or products for nature restoration by citizens.\nThis topic should actively engage citizens and support bottom-up and participatory approaches. It is particularly relevant for SMEs, for instance for the development of kits or digital tools.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g. gender and intersectional expertise, education and behavioural sciences) and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.

It supports climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, that ensure long-term economic security and opportunities, respect planetary boundaries and address climate uncertainties. This calls for a systematic integration of NbS across sectors and policy levels. Proposals are encouraged to apply a multi-actor approach to engage with actors from research, policy and practice, as well as SSH disciplines, to support the above-mentioned systemic NbS integration and evidence-based decision-making, and produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities\nProposals should enable the scaling up and mainstreaming of NbS, aligning with key policies, including the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Climate Adaptation Strategy, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan, the EU Forest Strategy, the Preparedness Union Strategy, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) notably targets 2, 8, and 11, the EU water and marine acquis, the European Water Resilience Strategy and the European Ocean Pact.\nProposals should:\n• co-design, develop and implement large scale pilots and/or interconnected NbS, following a land/sea-scape approach to ensure positive measurable outcomes and addressing multiple challenges, prioritising climate adaptation and mitigation, water resilience, and creating new economic opportunities, while addressing biodiversity loss. Where relevant, links should also be made to opportunities for disaster risk and air pollution reduction;\n• advance methods to assess the long-term viability of NbS, ensuring that the knowledge gained is integrated into policy, infrastructure, and spatial planning while respecting socio-economic and ecological thresholds;\n• facilitate effective collaboration and knowledge transfer among researchers, practitioners, policymakers, public authorities as well as SSH disciplines to support evidence-based decision-making, making use of relevant existing platforms and, where possible, expanding beyond the European context;\n• develop and synthesise knowledge and tools to better assess and mitigate the potential unintended consequences and risks associated with the implementation of NbS;\n• assess environmental, social and economic impacts of NbS, building on existing knowledge and frameworks, and analyse the mechanisms to scale these solutions.\nProposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate provide recommendations to policy makers. Applicants should create synergies with and build on results of other EU-funded NbS projects. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, including the collaboration with the EU NbS Task Forces.

          "scope": "Achieving the goals of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 , the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, and assessing progress towards their defined targets, requires coherent, integrated and long-term monitoring approaches, underpinned by FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data systems. Many existing in-situ data collections (i.e. genomic assessments, ground sampling, drone and airborne observations) were not designed with Satellite Remote Sensing integration in mind (i.e. for validation and calibration, integrated data products, or statistical scaling of information) and lack the structure, interface and metadata required to support advanced analytics, including AI. FAIR data on species and ecosystems will also help to ensure that biodiversity preservation is a mainstream feature of other sectors, such as agriculture, transport, energy or the bioeconomy. There is a need for systemic, harmonised or standardised biodiversity data at Earth’s surface in order to support AI applications ranging from genome to space and to build up our knowledge on the status and trends of habitats, species, ecosystems, and on the drivers of decline.\nTo address these challenges, proposals should:\n• develop and validate fit-for-purpose multisensory biodiversity data integration systems, to enable omics-based and in-situ data harmonization and integration with remote sensing data from space or sub-orbital platforms, as well as socio-ecological and climatic data for enhancing assessment of ecosystem condition and degradation, and the predictive modelling of biodiversity trends at international, regional and European scales;\n• develop concrete technical capabilities able to answer to diverse use cases, across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in Member States and Associated Countries. To this end, proposals should identify and prioritise critical biodiversity knowledge gaps and their data needs, with a focus on predictive analytics and the use of AI, and address them by designing data integration approaches that support scientific and policy needs, including biodiversity protection, restoration, and sustainable use goals and targets, as well as other related policy objectives;\n• develop demonstration and verification cases focusing on specific ecosystems under the EU ecosystem typology [1] and habitats, including ecotones [2] , identified as those under pressure or as restoration priorities. Proposals should take into account socio-economic pressures and activities impacting ecosystems, including land and sea use and emissions of pollutants (e.g. agriculture, aquaculture, urbanization, resource exploitation and management practices). Demonstration cases should be relevant to EO applications, such as AI-assisted ecosystem and habitat mapping, ensuring interoperability with European and global frameworks such as the Global Ecosystem Typology as well as EUNIS, and aligned with reporting requirements under the Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive and EU Nature Restoration Regulation;\n• deliver FAIR data, harmonisation workflows and processing protocols supporting data integration from genome to space and verify the use of generated datasets on identified analysis needs. Proposals should link observation data to emerging socio-economic, climate, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and environmental data and to relevant data infrastructures, including, if applicable, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Common Data Spaces and SAGE [3] ;\n• contribute to consensus and implementation of joint definitions of data collection, metadata and processing protocols, data quality and harmonization of standards enabling the integration of observations “from genomes to space”.\nProposals should earmark resources for cooperation with existing initiatives such as in-situ data collection frameworks (e.g., GBIF, OBIS, LUCAS).The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may join the selected consortium in relation to effective coordination with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service, as well as incorporating the in-situ data from European Commission steered biodiversity monitoring schemes such as LUCAS, specifically LUCAS grassland, and EMBAL (European Monitoring of Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes). Proposals may consider services offered by European research infrastructures [4] .\nThis topic is part of the Biodiversity cluster of the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative (ESSI). Proposals should foresee sufficient mean for effective coordination with projects selected under ESA’s FuturEO programme.\n[1] The “EU ecosystem typology” is a classification of ecosystem types developed by the Commission and the European Environmental Agency, in collaboration with Member States and it is tailored to meet EU needs. Its first level is legislated and is used for the reporting under in Annex IX of Regulation (EU) 691/2011.\n[2] Ecotones are areas of steep transition between ecological communities, ecosystems, and/or ecological regions along an environmental or other gradient.

          "scope": "The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 includes a science-policy mechanism and greater efforts to support the implementation of biodiversity commitments at EU and global levels. The strategy also explicitly calls for the use of NbS as a central component in addressing both biodiversity loss and climate change. In line with the Commission’s priority 'A global Europe’, the EU is demonstrating leadership in this field, notably by enhancing its support to the multilateral processes and platforms addressing the biodiversity crisis. This topic covers essential functions of the Science Service for Biodiversity, broader science-policy support for multiple actors in relation to the global IPBES and CBD processes, as well as support to collaborations and knowledge exchange specifically on NbS. The Science Service, linked to the KCBD, plays a critical role in supporting evidence-based decision making within the EU. In addition, the KCBD acts as one of the European Technical and Scientific Support Centres (TSCs) established under the CBD, which support knowledge transfer and capacity building to help CBD Parties implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).\nProposals should:\n• support the provision of a functional Science Service for Biodiversity, in close collaboration with the KCBD, acting as a one-stop-shop – a single-entry point for providing the overall support on evidence-based services (answering knowledge requests, tools, coordination, capacity building) that enable policymakers, other decision makers and stakeholders in Europe and beyond to ensure the protection, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity. Successful proposals should: provide high-quality evidence-based responses to biodiversity-related policy requests submitted to the KCBD, by involving relevant researchers, particularly those from EU-funded projects. Proposals are expected to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts; maintain and extend active knowledge exchange networks, including through capacity building, to strengthen the bridge between policy, science and society; maintain, enrich and expand a set of Science Service tools, enabling all relevant actors to use and benefit from the best available biodiversity knowledge;\n• strengthen the capacity of researchers and negotiators from the EU and Associated Countries to engage in IPBES and CBD processes. Successful proposals should: provide scientific and back-office support to negotiators involved in these processes; facilitate and support the engagement of researchers from the EU and Associated Countries in these processes. Proposals are expected to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts; facilitate technical and scientific cooperation, knowledge transfer and networking between researchers, stakeholders, policymakers and other decision makers to enhance awareness and application of IPBES deliverables; support the KCBD in its tasks as a European TSC mobilising and/or generating evidence and knowledge to implement the GBF.\n• enhance and expand dynamic knowledge exchange mechanisms on NbS, coupled with targeted capacity-building initiatives, to reinforce the interface between policy, scientific research, business and societal engagement. Successful proposals should also: ensure a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform on NbS serves to bridge science, policy, practice, and business, fostering the co-creation, dissemination, and uptake of research-based knowledge. This platform should play a key role in promoting policy coherence, encouraging collaborative action, and building capacity among Member States and Associated Countries, communities, and actors at all levels.\nSuccessful proposals should support the new Commission policy priorities for 2024-2029 with a focus on “Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature”. This implies support to the implementation of the goals of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the GBF and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This requires interactions with IPBES, the CBD Secretariat, and the EC via the KCBD. Knowledge generated under this topic is also expected to inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy after 2030.\nProposals should build on existing knowledge and the results of past and on-going projects, and foresee close collaboration with, and tailored support to the KCBD and its Science Service. The possible participation of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the project would facilitate this collaboration and support. Proposals should also foresee cooperation with the European Biodiversity Partnership (Biodiversa+) and its funded projects. Proposal aspects addressing the platform on NbS should build upon the foundations and outcomes of the NetworkNaturePLUS project.\nProposals are strongly encouraged to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, respond to biodiversity-related policy requests or engage relevant expertise in IPBES and CBD processes. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Consortia need to define a fair and transparent selection process for third parties, for which financial support may be granted. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the project will support the engagement of leading researchers from the EU and Associated Countries in IPBES and CBD processes.\nThe Plan for exploitation and dissemination should ensure the valorisation of available knowledge to policy makers, stakeholders and the public.",

          "scope": "Ecosystem restoration strategies for nature restoration and climate change mitigation require a coordinated and coherent set of human interventions and management practices (e.g. temporal protection of plants or removing invasive species, including their seeds) for which there is usually no dedicated mean like specific machinery, equipment or other technical innovations (like for example specific lures for invasive alien species). The most common practice is the use of agricultural machinery or equipment, but this is not always effective.\nWith target 4 of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU took the following commitments: significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored; habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, and at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend. According to the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, Member States shall put in place effective and area-based restoration measures with the aim to jointly cover, as a Union target, at least 20 % of land areas and at least 20 % of sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. This is reflected in target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in which they should promote Nature-based Solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation. These policies and legislations have reached the implementation stage in the EU and worldwide.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n• design, develop and test technical innovations corresponding to identified needs for specific ecosystems protection and/or restoration activities. A wide range of possible innovations can be proposed, including new or adapted machines, low techs, digital innovations or combinations of them to be used in a wide range of ecosystem types, including terrestrial, freshwater and marine;\n• pay attention to effectiveness, simplicity of use, durability and environmental sustainability and responsibility (including alertness to potential risks, trade-offs and the unintended consequences as a result of the use of technological innovations).\nThis topic is particularly relevant for SMEs.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.",

          "scope": "Invasive alien species are one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. Besides inflicting major damage to nature and the economy, many invasive alien species also facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and native wildlife. The rate of new introductions of invasive alien species has increased in recent years. Without effective control measures, risks to our nature and health will continue to rise. Climate change and land-use changes facilitate the spread and establishment of many alien species.\nProposals are expected to support the prevention, eradication and/or management of invasive alien species by stakeholders, including adaptive management approaches. This topic is related to target 12 the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species) and to target 6 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: reduce the introduction of Invasive Alien Species by 50% by 2030 and minimize their impact. Proposals should support the implementation of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the EU regulation on invasive alien species and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the IPBES assessment on invasive alien species (2023) [1] . All ecosystem types (terrestrial, fresh and/or marine waters) may be addressed.\nLiving labs can empower the green transition by co-creating solutions and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.\nSuccessful proposals should:\n• set up at least three living labs, composed each of 10 to 20 experimental sites, following the three main principles: (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users. Transboundary living labs are encouraged and living labs are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries;\n• establish a detailed work plan of the activities to be undertaken in a transdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted innovative solutions. Where appropriate, activities should advance knowledge on invasive alien species to support the development of solutions;\n• conduct participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs with the objectives of: building on existing methods (including ensuring the integration of existing solutions) or developing new ones for detecting and monitoring invasive alien species, such as the use of citizen science, eDNA, remote sensing and machine learning algorithms, and test them at scale. Proposals could build on pilots developed by the European partnership Biodiversa+; designing and testing innovative eradication and management strategies and methods which may include, for instance, physical removal and the use of biological control or chemical control. Innovative tools such as bio-engineering might be explored in conjunction with more traditional methods. Range shifts induced by climate change should be considered;\n• monitor and carry out an assessment of the innovative strategies, methods and tools and their effectiveness. Measures to ensure the prevention of re-invasion should be considered as well, to secure the continued effectiveness of the proposed solutions;\n• disseminate the newly developed solutions, to facilitate their uptake by practitioners;\n• provide data and experience usable for decision-makers, to assess socio-economic impacts of invasive alien species, side-effects of the management, the cost of inaction and the benefits of eradication or effective management, with effective contribution from social sciences and humanities;\n• address challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions. A gender-sensitive and inclusive approach should be integrated, examining how invasive alien species affect individuals’ livelihoods and well-being differently.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline to enhance the societal impact of the research activities.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly for real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to store and give access to research data should be considered. A citizen science approach could be appropriate for this action to produce, collect and analyse data.\nFinancial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nProposals should cooperate with the Joint Research Centre to use the resources of and make results available to, when relevant, the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN).\nProposals should ensure cooperation with relevant initiatives of the European partnership Biodiversa+ and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] as well as related projects in the environment domain. International cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] IPBES (2023).

Leveraging synergies in business action on climate to strengthen overall resilience also needs to be considered;\n• policy and decision makers benefit from improved knowledge to drive transformative policy including fiscal reforms to align economic incentives with nature positive investments and scalable biodiversity finance mechanisms (including blended finance, green bonds, nature credits, ecosystem service markets, etc.);\n• to ensure clear evaluation frameworks for effectiveness, policy and decision makers have access to improved measurement and reporting of economic and business impacts, dependencies, and efforts on biodiversity.",
          "scope": "Current economic systems are often driven by growth models and competitive pressures that prioritise short-term profits and speed over the long-term health of ecosystems. These systems also fail to account for environmental externalities, making nature positive solutions appear less affordable than they truly are. This has led to the exploitation of natural resources, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity, which in turn has significant negative impacts on both the environment and human well-being. Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services is not just important, it is essential to preserving life on Earth, as they underpin the very systems that sustain all human and natural life. As these systems continue, the consequences are becoming increasingly clear: climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, pollution and species extinction, all of which undermine the foundations of human society, business, and future prosperity. A nature positive economy, on the other hand, focuses on restoring and enhancing the natural systems that support life on Earth, ultimately benefiting and improving the resilience of our economy.\nThe topic should work to achieve the objectives and the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the ‘Roadmap towards nature Credits’, EU Sustainable Finance Policy including the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF, and notably targets 14, 15, 18 and 19) and the Task Force on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\nProposals should:\n• support decision-making for a nature positive economy by addressing knowledge and practice gaps, advancing transparent and standardised biodiversity metrics, improving accessibility of assessment methods and data, integrating economic risks related to biodiversity loss into corporate strategies and reporting. Where possible lessons learned should inform and scale-up initiatives to achieve a nature positive economy also beyond the European context;\n• improve the knowledge on effective biodiversity incentives including through fiscal reforms and phasing out harmful subsidies to support the development of policies and financial strategies for nature positive investments;\n• pilot innovative financial mechanisms and valuation approaches in real-world business contexts, including instruments for mobilising private finance such as nature credits, to strengthen the business case for biodiversity protection, restoration and sustainable use, including through Nature-based Solutions;\n• carry out demonstration actions to help integrate research into policy and practice and to demonstrate operational pathways for long term transformative change and for the acceleration of nature positive economy;\n• use and build on available biodiversity data sources, including from biodiversity monitoring schemes, for the purpose of developing corporate strategies and sustainability metrics in the private sector. This includes considering the potential of AI;\n• develop, analyse and/or promote ways of making sustainability reporting more accessible, efficient, and accurate for businesses of all sizes and particularly for start-ups and SMEs, with a view to promote an equitable and manageable compliance framework. Leveraging AI, digital automation and sector specific insights is encouraged.\nProposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate, provide recommendations to policy makers.\nProposals should create synergies with and build on results of other relevant EU-funded projects on biodiversity, economics and finance, and ensure cooperation with the European partnership Biodiversa+. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. Proposals should also foresee links with voluntary market initiatives, e.g., the TNFD or others. Proposals must follow a multi-actor approach, engaging researchers, businesses, financial institutions, public authorities, policy makers, and civil society to co-develop and apply solutions.\n[1] For more information on nature-based enterprises please refer to page 6 and 8 of the European Commission Expert Publication (2022): The vital role of nature-based solutions in a nature positive economy: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/85aeb571-c69c-11ec-b6f4-01aa75ed71a1",

          "scope": "As nature positive actions gain momentum and biodiversity is increasingly integrated into policies, it is essential to ensure governance frameworks can support large-scale, coordinated implementation. Relevant stakeholders should be actively involved in shaping new solutions adapted to different and local contexts.\nLiving labs have the potential to empower a green transition and a transformative change towards nature positive society and economy by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings to achieve large-scale impact and foster collaboration between sectors and communities.\nProposals should align with key policies including the European Green Deal and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), the Paris Agreement, the European Climate Law and the One Health approach.\nProposals should:\n• establish living labs as real-world testing environments to experiment with policy solutions, stakeholder engagement, and new economic models, while strengthening collective capacities and well-being, and identifying and overcoming barriers that limit participation in living labs;\n• develop inclusive, intersectional and adaptive governance strategies that foster systemic transformative change, based on both biodiversity and socio-economic metrics and emphasising equity and sustainability.\nIn particular, actions are expected to:\n• conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of policies related to both direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, with the aim of identifying conflicting or competing objectives and informing more coherent, nature positive policy frameworks;\n• analyse the legal, financial and institutional barriers to inclusive governance in Europe, including the assessment of political and economic obstacles and of active strategies by actors and develop proposals to pilot and test innovative policy instruments, such as citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgeting and, if and when relevant, nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] , to foster transformative change;\n• develop multi-level governance models and policy proposals to integrate all relevant nature positive actions (including protection and restoration of ecosystems, Nature-based Solutions, circular economy, sustainable bioeconomy, regenerative agriculture, agroecology, agroforestry, bioremediation, etc.) into all relevant EU policies and strategies in a synergetic and coherent way;\n• identify relevant existing EU funded communities of practices, such as the Nature-based Solutions hubs, the circular economy hubs and the adaptation hubs, and group them per ecosystem or societal challenge;\n• set-up living labs to co-develop enabling pathways for transformative change and test them to ensure positive impacts on the ground, drawing on best practices (including emerging nature positive actions), identifying knowledge gaps and addressing research and innovation needs in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders;\n• develop digital tools to synthesise and visualise diverse knowledge sources and create decision-support systems for inclusive governance, in view to inform all stakeholders about all existing nature positive actions per ecosystem or societal challenge and to propose the best options in terms of both biodiversity and socio-economic gains for a specific and/or local context (e.g. surface area, available budget, main challenge, specific regional area).\nProposals should address Area A: living labs per ecosystem (marine, freshwater, terrestrial (including agriculture, forestry, cities)) or Area B: living labs per societal challenge (climate change, water, food, health, pollution, spatial planning). The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nProposals should ensure close collaboration with the other project selected under this topic. They should also offer training for policymakers, community leaders, and researchers on co-governance and knowledge integration and develop educational materials and ensure coordination and exchanges between all living labs. Proposals should adopt interdisciplinary approaches and ensure policymakers, business leaders and stakeholders co-create, experiment, and validate new solutions in an open, user-centred way.\nSolutions should be adapted to the environmental, socio-economic, and cultural contexts of each living lab, considering both cultural and natural heritage. Scaling and transferability challenges should be addressed through collaborative approaches combining scientific knowledge with local expertise. In this respect, particular attention could be paid to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions. The gender dimension should also be integrated.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving a range of stakeholders, including when relevant farmers, foresters and land managers, fishing and aquaculture communities, spatial planners and landscape architects, tourism actors, water governance bodies, business leaders, energy producers, local authorities, NGOs and youth organisations, to ensure that the knowledge and needs from various sectors are integrated and the results are impactful.\nProposals should seek to address knowledge gaps identified by IPBES assessments and, if relevant, provide recommendations to policymakers. They should build on existing knowledge from and ensure complementarity with other relevant EU-funded projects under Horizon Europe Work Programmes [2] , including Biodiversa+ and NetworkNaturePLUS, and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines to collect and validate both technical and socio-economic data.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] EU-funded projects leading the way to transformative change for biodiversity - European Commission , https://erc.europa.eu/projects-statistics/mapping-erc-frontier-research/frontier-research-transformative-change and https://www.biodiversa.eu/2024/06/11/2024-2025-joint-call/",

Describe the impact of the stressors induced by the drivers of biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem dynamics on their health, meaning their physiology, genetic diversity, population distribution and ecology. Taking into consideration the most updated scientific scenarios (e.g. IPBES nexus assessment), predict the future health status of these ecosystems and wild species in the short, mid and long term;\n• propose benchmark protocols to ensure comparability between research communities (including social sciences and humanities) and define common indicators describing the risks (e.g. loss of ecosystem services, exposure to pollutants and pathogens) and benefits (e.g. dilution effect, exposure to beneficial microorganisms, etc.) of the interlinkages of wild species and ecosystem health, domestic animal and plant health and human health. This includes the integration of ecosystem and wildlife health in the exposome approach;\n• assess the impacts of the degradation of ecosystem and wildlife health on human health, including a cost-benefit analysis of nature restoration and conservation projects in terms of human health benefits and the costs of inaction. This should include disability and intersectional aspects and the groups in the most vulnerable situations in society (e.g. low-income communities, youth, older people, persons with disabilities, LGBTIQ people, people with racial or religious minority background). Based on this, provide actionable policy recommendations for policymakers and authorities in establishing a One Health policy framework.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service and ensure cooperation with the EU Biodiversa+ and Animal Health and Welfare partnerships [2] .

          "scope": "Maintaining and improving farmland bird populations is crucial for both conservation and the long-term sustainability of food production systems. Farmland birds and mammals provide valuable ecosystem services, such as pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal, which are essential for resilient agriculture. Focusing on birds ensures the preservation of these services, while also contributing to broader biodiversity goals. Additionally, including farmland mammals in the research helps assess potential synergies and trade-offs in pest control, providing a more holistic ecological understanding. As farmland birds and mammals can cause damage by consuming crops, it is important that research seeks the correct equilibrium between the utility of these animals and the damage they can cause. This broader perspective allows for more informed decisions on how to design farming systems that are not only beneficial to bird populations but also support the protection and restoration of healthy ecosystems. Overall, the objective is to foster sustainable agriculture that enhances both productivity and biodiversity, and offers opportunities for nature restoration.\nProposals should:\n• synthetize the impact of various farming practices on both farmland bird populations and agricultural productivity, while also considering farmland mammals for a more comprehensive picture. Also, assessing the role and impact of specific bird species in pest control and soil health to better understand their contributions in agricultural landscapes and to the sustainability of farming systems;\n• develop participatory research programs that encourage landscape-level collaboration among farmers, land managers, and conservationists. These programs should focus on identifying and testing locally tailored bird-friendly solutions while addressing farmers' perceptions, needs, and challenges in adopting these practices;\n• improve existing incentives (also under CAP), or potentially create new targeted ones to promote the adoption of bird- and mammal-friendly solutions. These incentives should be geographically relevant and designed to address farmers' specific challenges, while fostering collaboration among farmers, land managers, and conservationists to ensure effective implementation and long-term sustainability;\n• design a comprehensive farmer education program focused on bird-friendly practices and their economic benefits. This should include advisory services with ecologists, field days, and demonstration farms showcasing successful bird-focused measures in profitable farming systems. Also assess effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning networks and highlight the economic co-benefits of these practices (e.g., pest reduction and pollination);\n• conduct research to assess the effectiveness of scaling proven biodiversity-friendly farming practices, such as creating and preserving semi-natural habitats of farmland or other farming practices and in consideration of at least maintaining productivity. Focus on successful models, that can be applied to different regions, and evaluate their impact on bird and selected mammal populations.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and Target 10 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving a range of stakeholders, particularly farmers and land managers, to ensure that the knowledge and needs from various sectors are integrated and the results are impactful.\nProposals should, where relevant, build on previous EU and nationally funded projects, including Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and LIFE, and the Agroecology Partnership; and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

          "scope": "Plant breeding has focused on maximising yield in single species stands for monocropping systems, leading to highly productive yet specialised varieties. As a result, most varieties on the market may not perform well in intercropping systems, where productivity and benefits often depend on the interactions between crops. To support farming practices that promote agrobiodiversity, there is a need to develop varieties specifically adapted to intercropping. However, selecting varieties specifically for intercropping remains a practical challenge for breeding.\nProposals should:\n• provide novel insights into interactions and mechanisms that influence intercrop performance by advancing understanding of plant traits affecting both inter- and intraspecific interactions and their impact on crop outcomes. The approach should consider eco-physiological processes [1] and ideally encompass both aboveground crop interactions and belowground dynamics between intercropped roots and soil organisms;\n• develop new organic breeding approaches that prioritise enhancing crop performance within multi-species systems, emphasising the importance of competition, complementarity and facilitation mechanisms between crops;\n• identify crop combinations and superior–performing variety combinations that consistently yield well together;\n• provide inputs for the development of future testing and selection criteria, as well as tools and methods for evaluating the performance of specialized genotypes in intercropping conditions, laying the groundwork for breeders and bodies entrusted to establish these frameworks.\nParticular attention should be given to aspects related to the regulations for the use and development of Organic Heterogeneous Material (OHM) and/or Organic Varieties Suitable for Organic Production (OVSOP) as innovative categories of plant reproductive material.\nIf applicable, proposal may advance pre-existing breeding material towards the development of OHM and/or OVSOP for intercropping, making use of the knowledge and tools developed within the project.\nProposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe and ensure collaboration with relevant ongoing projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructure [2] in the environment, biological and food domains.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate the new organic breeding approaches for intercropping.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, to the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [3] , to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (notably target 8) and to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (target 10).\n[1] biological and physiological mechanisms that plants undergo to interact with the surrounding physical, chemical and biological environments when cultivated in an intercrop system (e.g. nutrient/water uptake, root structure, interactions with insects/pollinators, disease incidents).\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

          "scope": "This topic supports the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). It builds on a series of CCRI-related topics funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and replicated every one to two programming year since 2021. The goal is to accelerate place-based innovation, boost skills and capacities and support the implementation of solutions for a circular systemic transition at city or region level. Implementing circular systemic solutions reduces environmental impacts and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by decreasing the extraction of primary raw materials and minimizing waste generation.\nThis topic specifically focuses on moving from demonstration to further deployment and upscaling through the setup of well-functioning real-life innovation ecosystem, such as living labs. This topic targets public local and regional authorities (or their groupings) in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Proposed living labs should enable systematic participation of all ecosystem stakeholder in targeted cities and regions to co-create solutions that are practical, relevant, and readily applicable. These stakeholders include citizens, policymakers, research bodies, academia, industries, start-ups and SMEs, social economy entities and financial intermediaries. In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach to involve end-users. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics. Proposals should set up engaging and effective governance structures, facilitate collaboration and coordination, and ensure continuous feedback and monitoring to enable an iterative and flexible process. Proposals should integrate systemic socio-ecological approaches and involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g., economics, politics, sociology, psychology, gender studies).\nProposals should support the validation, testing and optimisation of innovative, circular systemic solutions in selected cities/regions (the ‘demonstrators’), along with relevant governance models and business plans. This CCRI-related topic does not target specific technologies or industrial sectors but supports a place-based approach. This means that proposals should select their targeted sector(s) and/or value chain(s), based on a detailed analysis of the local/regional contexts and specific circular potentials.\nProposals should facilitate knowledge and experience transfer for further outreach and large scale replication across Europe. Proposals should turn their insights into actionable recommendations, identifying the lessons learned, specifying the enabling framework, main barriers and enablers, business case, and other relevant factors for successful replication and upscaling in other cities and/or regions (the ‘replicators’).\nAt least two different demonstration and three replication ‘living labs’ (incl. cities/regions – possibly together with their public and/or private ecosystem partners in their territory) must be part of the consortium. One out of the three replication labs must be located in Horizon Europe widening countries (including Outermost Regions).\nProposals should clearly specify how they will ensure synergies and complementarities with other relevant circular economy projects and initiatives, including those recognised as CCRI Projects [1] and CCRI Associated Partners [2] . In that sense, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the CCRI office, projects and partners (e.g. thematic discussion groups, joint events, joint R&I gap analysis and policy briefs). Clustering and dissemination activities will be facilitated and supported by the CCRI Coordination and Support Office to ease knowledge exchange, foster solution replication and uptake, and maximise impact.\nThis topic contributes to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal, in particular the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP), as well as the new EU bioeconomy strategy. It also supports the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy by fostering placed-based (social, technological and non-technological) innovation to make European cities and regions more circular, resilient and competitive.\nLinkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission should be explored – whenever relevant.\n[1] List of CCRI Projects from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects .

          "scope": "The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand in clean tech and energy-intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll-out of clean energy and manufacturing, to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 2026-2027 work programme supports fit-for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus exclusively on clean tech and energy-intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n• implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

          "scope": "Electrical and electronic equipment continues to be one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with current annual growth rates of 2%. It is estimated that less than 40% of electronic waste is collected in the EU. [1] Value is lost when fully or partially functional products are discarded because they are not reparable, the battery cannot be replaced, the software is no longer supported, or materials incorporated in devices are not recovered.\nIncreasing recovery of critical raw materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment is a strategic priority to mitigate supply risks. Today, CRM recovery rates are generally low, with increases requiring new recovery processes and interface optimisation with pre-processing to ensure appropriate material flows for efficient recovery are generated. [2]\nProposals should:\n• develop, test and demonstrate new or improved ecodesign of consumer electronics, including design for durability, reusability, reparability, disassembly, separability, recyclability, uptake of recycled content. This may include design solutions for the reuse of components and for easier dismantling leading to increased reparability, remanufacturing or recycling with use of solutions and technologies such as active disassembly/debonding materials and adhesives, and design solutions targeting critical and strategic raw materials;\n• assess and provide recommendations for mechanisms and incentives to address the trade-offs with costs and innovation limitations and to reward design for circularity and product durability – such as extended guarantees, “second” VAT reduction, or others –, and test and demonstrate new business models such as leasing and product-service-systems, to the extent that they reinforce positive design changes.\nProposed solutions need to be aligned with chemical safety principles (SSbD) and in compliance with relevant legislation such as RoHS. The environmental performance of the proposed solutions in comparison to existing products should be evaluated from a lifecycle perspective using product environmental footprint methodology wherever applicable. Participation of partners from (associated) countries with actual electronics production is encouraged. Participation of SMEs is encouraged. Consumer benefits are at the centre of this topic, and it is vital that the consumer perspective is duly reflected in all activities. The topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nThis topic supports the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, in particular with a view to the reparability of small household appliances, the WEEE Directive, contribute to waste prevention, higher circularity and uptake of recyclate, and Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products.\n[1] https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/f4c7be39-efa9-4beb-88e0-4c5fdd37de7b?lang=en\n[2] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092134492030241X",

          "scope": "This topic supports the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). It builds on a series of CCRI-related topics funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and replicated every one to two programming year since 2021. The goal is to accelerate place-based innovation, boost skills and capacities and support the implementation of solutions for a circular systemic transition at city or region level. Implementing circular systemic solutions reduces environmental impacts and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by decreasing the extraction of primary raw materials and minimizing waste generation.\nThis topic specifically focuses on moving from demonstration to further deployment and upscaling through the setup of well-functioning real-life innovation ecosystem, such as living labs. This topic targets public local and regional authorities (or their groupings) in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Proposed living labs should enable systematic participation of all ecosystem stakeholder in targeted cities and regions to co-create solutions that are practical, relevant, and readily applicable. These stakeholders include citizens, policymakers, research bodies, academia, industries, start-ups and SMEs, social economy entities and financial intermediaries. In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach to involve end-users. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics. Proposals should set up engaging and effective governance structures, facilitate collaboration and coordination, and ensure continuous feedback and monitoring to enable an iterative and flexible process. Proposals should integrate systemic socio-ecological approaches and involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g., economics, politics, sociology, psychology, gender studies).\nProposals should support the validation, testing and optimisation of innovative, circular systemic solutions in selected cities/regions (the ‘demonstrators’), along with relevant governance models and business plans. This CCRI-related topic does not target specific technologies or industrial sectors but supports a place-based approach. This means that proposals should select their targeted sector(s) and/or value chain(s), based on a detailed analysis of the local/regional contexts and specific circular potentials.\nProposals should facilitate knowledge and experience transfer for further outreach and large scale replication across Europe. Proposals should turn their insights into actionable recommendations, identifying the lessons learned, specifying the enabling framework, main barriers and enablers, business case, and other relevant factors for successful replication and upscaling in other cities and/or regions (the ‘replicators’).\nAt least two different demonstration and three replication ‘living labs’ (incl. cities/regions – possibly together with their public and/or private ecosystem partners in their territory) must be part of the consortium. One out of the three replication labs must be located in Horizon Europe widening countries (including Outermost Regions).\nProposals should clearly specify how they will ensure synergies and complementarities with other relevant circular economy projects and initiatives, including those recognised as CCRI Projects [1] and CCRI Associated Partners [2] . In that sense, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the CCRI office, projects and partners (e.g. thematic discussion groups, joint events, joint R&I gap analysis and policy briefs). Clustering and dissemination activities will be facilitated and supported by the CCRI Coordination and Support Office to ease knowledge exchange, foster solution replication and uptake, and maximise impact.\nThis topic contributes to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal, in particular the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP), as well as the new EU bioeconomy strategy. It also supports the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy by fostering placed-based (social, technological and non-technological) innovation to make European cities and regions more circular, resilient and competitive.\nLinkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission should be explored – whenever relevant.\n[1] List of CCRI Projects from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects .

          "scope": "Construction is one of the most resource-intensive sectors of the economy. The construction sector is responsible for almost 39% of the EU’s total waste generation. [1] Greenhouse gas emissions from material extraction, manufacturing of construction products, construction and renovation of buildings are estimated at 5-12% of total national GHG emissions. [2] Greater material efficiency could save 80% of those emissions. [3] Cement, steel, aluminium and plastics are the materials contributing by 15% to EU carbon emissions.\nProposals should:\n• develop, test and demonstrate new and improved ecodesign of construction materials and products, including design for durability, reusability, reparability, separability, recyclability, and uptake of recycled content. Solutions promoting assembly and disassembly of products should be considered, and solutions for the reuse of recovered materials;\n• assess and provide recommendations for mechanisms and incentives to reward design for circularity, disassembly, and product durability – such as extended guarantees, VAT reduction, and others –, and analyse potential trade-offs and propose solutions to overcome them.\nThe environmental performance of the proposed solutions in comparison to existing products should be evaluated from a lifecycle perspective using product environmental footprint methodology wherever applicable. The possible presence of contaminants in construction products and waste and its impact on circularity must be taken into account. Reuse and recycling options should involve quality control and assessment.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals of the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative. Joint activities with NEB projects are encouraged. Proposals should also seek to build synergies with construction-focused projects funded under Clusters 6 and 4, and are strongly encouraged to organise joint activities, ensure synergies and undertake clustering activities with those. Participation of partners from (associated) countries with growing construction sectors is encouraged.\nProposals should seek to involve SMEs and regional ecosystems.\nThe topic supports the European Green Deal, the Construction Products Regulation, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, and Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products.\n[1] Eurostat data for 2022, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/f0673b56-1bf2-490f-86e2-56bebc77e009?lang=en\n[2] https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/hallbart-byggande-och-forvaltning/miljoindikatorer---aktuell-status/vaxthusgaser/\n[3] Hertwich, E., Lifset, R., Pauliuk, S., Heeren, N., IRP, (2020), Resource Efficiency and Climate Change: Material Efficiency Strategies for a Low-Carbon Future.",

          "scope": "The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand in clean tech and energy-intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll-out of clean energy and manufacturing, to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 2026-2027 work programme supports fit-for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus exclusively on clean tech and energy-intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and expertise.\nProposals should:\n• Implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate change and biodiversity loss.\nUrban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources.\nIn view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, social inequality and non-diversified economic activity and will need to become more resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential. [1]\nThe integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related activities.\nProposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission should be explored whenever relevant.\nProposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.\n[1] https://citiesofmaking.com/project/what-is-urban-manufacturing/",

          "scope": "As the EU strives to reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption, as outlined in the European Green Deal, the Clean Industrial Deal and the upcoming Circular Economy Act, extending product lifecycles through repair and refurbishment practices has become a key approach for achieving a circular economy and extending products’ lifecycles. To support this transition, there is a growing need for innovative capacity-building initiatives that equip professionals, consumers, local authorities and educators with the skills and knowledge required to repair and refurbish products. These practices can contribute to the extension of product lifecycles, thus reducing environmental and climate impacts and contributing for the development of a single market for sustainable products.\nProposals should:\n• develop and test innovative, modular and scalable training programs for professionals, consumers, local partners, social economy actors and educators, focusing on the repair and refurbishment of one or more of the following product categories: electronics (including household appliances), furniture, textiles and footwear. These training programs should create engaging, accessible and effective learning experiences that support the development of repair and refurbishment skills;\n• develop and test new services for repair and refurbishment, as well as strategies for their uptake, considering the potential to reduce biodiversity impacts, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, and promote sustainable consumption patterns. The focus should be on making them accessible and affordable to all consumers, including those with disabilities or with limited access, financial resources or technical expertise. To achieve this, the strategies should investigate various approaches: such as affordable, accessible and convenient repair services, community-based repair initiatives, and knowledge and expertise sharing mechanisms and digital platforms;\n• evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and impact of these new services and strategies using robust evaluation methods (including lifecycle assessments such as Product Environmental Footprint, where relevant) and present data and evidence about the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of the developed strategies.\nThe topic supports EU policies, particularly the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, the upcoming Circular Economy Act and Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.",

          "scope": "The local character of biomass and other biological resources and the high number of micro-companies and SMEs involved in sectors that deal with biological resources explain why research and innovations are best developed in line with the local and regional context. “Places” (geographical defined areas as defined in the previous footnote) play an important role in the transition to a sustainable and circular EU bioeconomy and have proven to act as a good platform for matching EU top-level policies and best practices with bottom-up entrepreneurship and innovation that is mobilised to meet an ambition and vision for the bioeconomy. Bioeconomy places are expected to lead the transition to a sustainable and circular bioeconomy by building their capacity to develop and deploy innovative bioeconomy solutions within a clearly defined local/regional governance framework and vision that is aligned to EU priorities and policies.\nProposals should:\n• develop definitions of and benchmarks that can allow to qualify a “Place” as “Bioeconomy Place” (i.e. a label to be awarded to “Places” that meet the definitions and benchmarks developed as part of the project), linked to and built upon the groundwork laid by the Regional Innovation Valleys (RIVs) for Bioeconomy and Food Systems , the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) [2] and other relevant projects. They should relate to the ability of the place to fulfil environmental (including biodiversity), social and economic sustainability criteria using bioeconomy solutions (e.g. including Nature-based Solutions), with particular attention to the sustainability of sourced biomass, climate mitigation, biodiversity protection circularity, food systems, social fairness and competitiveness.\n• set up at least three “Bioeconomy Place” pilot sites, which are expected to be located in at least three different EU Member States/Associated Countries. At least one of the pilot sites should be located fully or partially in Ukraine. In these sites, proposals should: carry out an analysis on needs, strengths and opportunities that should include but is not limited to infrastructure (analysing physical and digital conditions for bioeconomy industrial clusters to be established), value chains (e.g. biomass sourcing mapping and industrial capacity mapping, with particular attention to SMEs and start-ups), consumer and civil society needs and awareness, skill readiness and devise, for each pilot site, a plan with commitments to transform the “Place” into a “Bioeconomy Place”, based on the analysis and benchmarks developed. These plans should: foster multi-stakeholder partnerships with local actors, taking into account a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations; establish synergies between urban, rural (where relevant, coastal) areas to optimise resource flows and promote the creation of new business models, value chains and jobs; develop training programmes that enhance technical and entrepreneurial skills, including biotechnology and digital skills relevant to the bioeconomy; provide capacity-building for bioeconomy stakeholders on access to funding and capital and on how to prepare bankable projects and attract private capital; and provide policy recommendations on how to progress in the deployment of bioeconomy solutions ensuring circularity.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving educational and employment institutions, industrial actors, unions and local and regional authorities in order to co-create the knowledge and adapted solutions to foster the establishment of Bioeconomy Places across Europe. Collaboration among all the pilot sites set up under the projects of this topic should be fostered. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate and advance the knowledge and findings from previously funded EU projects [3] and work with projects from topics under this WP. All projects under this topic need to closely collaborate.\n[1] For the purposes of this topic, Bioeconomy Places are understood as geographically-defined areas (such as regions, their sub-entities, groups of municipalities, rural or urban, including cross-border) where bioeconomy solutions are used for sustainable prosperity and community well-being considering the specific needs, strengths and potential of each place.\n[2] Both the RIV and CCRI initiatives have already tested place-based circular bioeconomy solutions, fostering local innovation ecosystems and stakeholder collaboration. \"Bioeconomy places\" can leverage these established networks and lessons learned to scale up successful models, tailor solutions to regional strengths, and ensure coherence across EU territories in delivering a resilient and sustainable bioeconomy.\n[3] For example, projects funded under H2020-RUR-09-2018, HORIZON-CL6-2021-CIRCBIO-01-08, HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01-7, HORIZON-CL6-2023-CIRCBIO-01-10 and H2020_RUR-09-2018.",

          "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n• enhanced capacity of private and public stakeholders to increase resource efficiency in collecting, processing and using primary and secondary biomass, ensuring that ecosystems and biodiversity are protected and restored, emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants reduced, and human needs for biomass satisfied in sufficient and fair way, including food security;\n• increased environmental, social and economic value added from the various uses of biomass, including bio-waste, e.g. food losses and food waste;\n• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and (air, water and soil) pollution, due to avoiding landfilling and incineration of bio-waste;\n• demonstrated environmental, social and economic and social benefits for the municipalities involved in the collection and provision of bio-waste.",
          "scope": "Successful proposals should contribute to the implementation of the new EU bioeconomy strategy and its action plan; and the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive, e.g. on bio-waste management. Project outcomes will contribute to the objectives of the recent initiatives on Circular Economy, Biotechnology, Competitiveness, the Clean Industrial Deal, the Vision for Agriculture and Food and Life Sciences.\nBioeconomy provides solutions to various challenges. However, companies see themselves challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are solutions to increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the demand, e.g. better valorise unused/under-exploited sustainable biomass resources (including unavoidable food waste and industrial residues), and degraded land, apply new breeding techniques and increase resource efficiency through circular design and circular business and consumption models.\nBio-waste represents a vast underutilised biomass resource with substantial potential for valorisation. Private and public actors that aggregate biomass waste streams, pretreat them and standardise them for further valorisation are well placed to foster its improved use. In addition, they play an essential role to increase the transparency of biomass waste supply flows and to provide platforms to match supply and demand. By supporting these types of actors, Europe can increase its capacity to transform more bio-waste into valuable commodities and contribute to sustainable and circular bioeconomy objectives and solutions based on biological resources (including ecosystems).\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n• study and optimise business models for the aggregation, pre-treatment, standardisation and primary valorisation of under-utilised biomass resources, including bio-waste from food losses and food waste and/or primary production/industrial biogenic residues. Engage with local governments to create compelling business cases and to showcase best practices that highlight the environmental, social and economic, benefits of bio-waste valorisation. In this context, the successful proposals should collaborate with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that biomass valorisation practices are socially acceptable and beneficial to communities, the environment and the economy;\n• support local, regional, and national bioeconomy actors, and develop new or strengthen existing platforms (at least 5) by connecting biomass suppliers, and users, both in urban and rural settings; provide guidance and links to local, regional, or national biomass plans; and facilitate business decisions, especially for SMEs. Additionally, map and study various types of platforms, potentially also digital marketplaces, that match biomass supply and demand within local, regional, and EU contexts;\n• identify barriers to and best available practices for the development of biomass platforms (e.g. end-of-waste criteria), and provide recommendations to address them, in national, regional and EU context;\n• develop tools and innovative approaches to optimize bio-waste collection, processing and logistics, enhancing resource efficiency and ecosystem health, as well as reducing costs. Exploit the potential of digital solutions to improve the traceability and management of bio-waste streams. Advance innovative and competitive business solutions, developing and testing technological innovations for biomass aggregation, pretreatment, and standardisation, including from under-utilised biomass resources, and processing towards added-value products.\nProposals should pay particular attention to areas where biomass is neither fully valorised nor utilised to its full potential, such as Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine and other EU candidate countries.\nProposals are encouraged to work together with relevant initiatives including those of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy, Bioeconomy Monitoring System, the EU Food Systems Monitoring Dashboard), the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, the New European Bauhaus and BIOEAST Initiative; as well as considering the topic ‘HORIZON-CL6-2026-CIRCBIO-10: Understanding biomass flows in Europe’. When addressing the collection, pre-treatment and valorisation of food losses and waste, proposals should explore potential links with the work of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste.\nThe multi-actor approach should be followed, involving concerned actors such as primary producers, industry representatives, regional/local authorities, research institutions.",

          "scope": "Chemical pollution of aquatic environments from contaminants and pollutants poses risks for human and environmental health. As recent assessments of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and of the Water Framework Directive have shown, large parts of Europe’s groundwater bodies, rivers, lakes, coastal, transitional and marine waters have not reached good status and often exceed regulatory threshold levels set to avoid potential risk to human health and the environment. Continued inflow of pollutants into the aquatic environment, coupled with their ubiquity and persistent nature is increasing the risk of accumulation and long-term exposure of organisms and human beings. While pollution prevention is the most effective measure to tackle aquatic pollution, more effective action and novel solutions are needed to bioremediate and decontaminate European waters from particularly harmful and persistent substances.\nAquatic microorganisms and their communities have developed various molecular mechanisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions enabling them to degrade a wide range of pollutants. The kinetics of community evolution and their molecular mechanisms must be considered. However, the complexity of contaminated marine and freshwater environments including groundwater, where multiple pollutants often coexist as mixtures, metabolites and transformation products are created with changing properties and toxicity levels and interactions with the soil or seabed properties makes risk assessment and remediation a significant challenge. Therefore, a better knowledge of CEC interaction with the surrounding environment (mechanisms, parameters of influence, soil constituents involved) is needed to develop optimised treatment. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have created new opportunities for environmental cleaning, particularly when combined with microbial remediation. As a result, aquatic pollutant-degrading microbes enhanced by nanoparticles are becoming increasingly valuable for developing biotechnological tools that can effectively clean up contaminated environments.\nProposals should:\n• develop and demonstrate novel approaches, locally adaptable and site-specific solutions for the bioremediation and decontamination of aquatic pollution at source, in rivers, lakes, coastal and groundwaters and at sea, including removal processes, management of degradation processes, ensuring the approaches do not harm the environment;\n• develop and demonstrate new, effective and affordable technologies, considering particularly solutions based on life sciences and biotechnology, including microorganisms and/or microbial communities and/or nanoparticles biosynthesized by microbial activity, for the removal of pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants, degrading pollutants (e.g. plastics, oil, hydrocarbons), marine mucilage, contaminants of emerging concern and targeted micropollutants (PFAS, pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials, pesticides and micro-and nano-plastics) from marine waters, wastewater and drinking waters and the environment including groundwater and sediments. Recovery of the biosynthesized nanoparticles will be an asset in proposals but not required;\n• integrate environmental monitoring methods (including effect-based methods), building on existing methodologies, and high-resolution methods for robust risk assessment of the impact of CECs on aquatic ecosystems, as well as assessment of the improved resilience of bioremediated aquatic ecosystems to climate change;\n• demonstrate pathways and interlinkages of the pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, and to develop understanding where management actions are most beneficial and needed;\n• ensure transparent engagement with stakeholders and society on solutions proposed.\nProposals should bring together a wide range of relevant stakeholders, i.e., researchers, technology providers, policy makers and local competent authorities to maximise impact. Case-studies representing the regional specificities in term of climate conditions are welcomed but not required.\nProposals should ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe, including the ones funded under the Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters” and under the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC). Projects should engage with and help build an emerging community on decontamination and bioremediation, in particular the one envisaged through the related public private initiative in the European Water Resilience Strategy.\nThe participation of SMEs and Start-ups in the consortia is encouraged. The JRC may contribute with its expertise related to nanotechnology/nanoparticles and environmental biotechnology particularly in metagenomics and to the effect-based methods for the chemical pollutants' detection in water.\nProjects under this topic are relevant to the European Ocean Pact, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, the Environmental Quality Standards Directive, the European Water Resilience Strategy, the EU zero pollution action plan, the Nature Restoration Regulation, the Commission communication on Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Life Sciences Strategy and the EU Biotech Act.",

          "scope": "The air we breathe is often polluted, which can lead to serious health problems and even premature death. To address this public health issue, it is essential to understand how pollutants move and interact in the air at different scales, from regional to street level and at different time periods during the day or in different seasons. However, current models used to predict air quality have limitations, particularly in terms of their grid resolution levels and their limited ability to accurately capture the complex interactions between different scales. This can lead to uncertainties and inaccuracies in assessing and predicting air quality, making it challenging to develop and take effective measures to improve air quality.\nThis topic aims to improve these capabilities by developing a chain of innovative integrated models, relatively easy to use and interpret, that can simulate the air quality situation in different scales and types of areas, including at ‘micro-scale’, and by integrating a temporal-scale dimension, also taking into account emissions into the ambient atmosphere from indoor environments. This should support the development of effective air quality planning strategies at various levels, ultimately helping to reduce air pollution and protect public health. Moreover, it should support the requirements in the revised Ambient Air Quality Directive as regards the development of Air Quality Roadmaps and Air Quality Plans, and for the design and planning of the network of monitoring stations.\nMore specifically, proposals should:\n• develop comprehensive multi-scale modelling chains possibly with two-way nesting capabilities (TRL 5), addressing air quality assessment, including spatial and temporal representativeness, and atmospheric processes of air pollution. Incorporate and improve urban canopy parameterization to better account for complex interactions between urban structures and air pollutants, including the role of urban vegetation in mitigating and/or fostering the formation and/or accumulation of specific air pollutants, with an emphasis on air pollutants with the highest health impacts;\n• analyse the current limitations associated with the integration of different models and multiple spatial/ temporal scales in a single modelling system and develop methods to improve and integrate the existing air quality models and required input datasets (TRL 5);\n• develop, configure and validate innovative micro-scale modelling systems at very high resolution with the aim of modelling and evaluating the impact of air quality measures to minimize, mitigate, and prevent exceedances at hotspot locations (TRL 5);\n• provide guidelines for air quality modelling to support decision making to improve air quality at all scales, including by harmonizing different types of models within an integrated system, as well as promoting the use and development of multi-scale online modelling systems.\nPopulation groups in vulnerable situations are disproportionally affected by air pollution. Proposals should consider the vulnerability dimension (e.g. for children, older people, women, people with lower socio-economic status, people with underlying health conditions) when approaching different scale analyses and provide recommendations on whether and how links could be made with data on social and spatial inequalities related to air pollution exposure and benefits of mitigation measures in developing inclusive air quality plans and in urban planning.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects and initiatives with a relevant air quality monitoring and/or modelling component to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid duplication. These could include projects funded under H2020 and Horizon Europe as well as under LIFE strategic integrated projects for clean air, such as LIFE PREPAIR and LIFE Malopolska.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] in the environment domain, such as ACTRIS [2] . Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nProposals should, where possible, build on results of and cooperate with AQUILA and FAIRMODE communities and pave the way for the possible transition of the project outcomes into the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. This topic is part of the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative, and projects should collaborate with related projects funded by ESA’s FuturEO programme and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as a member of the consortium selected for funding. In particular, the JRC could, as relevant, promote and support the harmonised use of scientifically sound air quality modelling approaches and help identify best practices in the area. In this regard, JRC would also usefully facilitate interaction with the JRC-chaired Forum for Air quality Modelling (FAIRMODE).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[2] Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure: https://www.actris.eu",

          "scope": "Industrial bio-based systems – made by the supply chain of bio-based feedstock and the industrial value chains - are key elements for the establishment of a fossil-free economy in the EU and Associated Countries (AC). Innovative industrial bio-based systems - also enabled by biotechnology applications - have the capacity to deliver products and services with improved environmental performances. To support the deployment of the best among such systems, it is necessary to create a framework which facilitate the benchmarking. The European Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) - based on the recently revised Industrial and Livestock Rearing Emission Directive (IED 2.0) - collects information on innovative techniques, including emerging [1] and transformative techniques, and assesses their level of development and their environmental performance, including their cost-effectiveness and their trade-offs.\nProposals should:\n• establish a forum of experts and stakeholders in the bioeconomy and in industrial bio-based systems, including representatives from academia, industry, and government. Members of the forum should be part of the project consortium and should cover, at least, the specific sectors as described in the bullet point below;\n• animate the work of the forum to: select and collect data on emerging techniques (as defined in Art. 3.14 of the IED 2.0) along the whole supply and value chain of industrial bio-based systems, on a worldwide basis, but especially those being tested or used in the EU and ACs. Assess their level of development and environmental performance, including their cost-effectiveness and trade-offs. Industrial bio-based systems in scope of this topic do not include food/feed, biofuels/bioenergy and health and medical devices; align the selection, the collection of relevant data and the assessment of such techniques with the approach of the European Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) and with the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy); give emphasis on relevant emerging techniques including, but not limited to, specific sectors: i) pulp & paper and bio-based chemicals, including the treatments and further conversion of industrial residues and waste from these sectors, ii) mechanical and chemical recycling of bio-based plastic, iii) bioremediation applications - also enabled by biotechnology - to remediate and regenerate polluted ecosystems. The scope of bioremediation applications should include landfills and mining; include data on climate change mitigation/adaptation and on the capacity for biodiversity protection and enhancement of the selected techniques, where relevant; align the collection of life cycle assessment (LCA) information, according to the Environmental Footprint recommendation, and the methodological guidance of the voluntary Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) Framework [2] , where applicable;\n• integrate the collected information and data into the Sevilla process through INCITE and into the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy).\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, for example in the collection of data on emerging techniques.\nSynergies with projects funded under the topics on bioeconomy in the current and past Cluster 6 work programmes, and with projects assessing the best practices in the biofuels/bioenergy sectors under Cluster 5 work programmes are encouraged.\n[1] ‘Emerging technique’ means a novel technique for an industrial activity that, if commercially developed, could provide either a higher general level of protection of human health and the environment or at least the same level of protection of human health and the environment and higher cost savings than existing best available techniques, Art 3 IED 2.0.\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022H2510",

Among these measures, (post-harvest) phytosanitary treatments [1] — such as vapour, heat, cold, irradiation, and controlled atmosphere — are critical tools to prevent the introduction and spread of regulated plant pests [2] through imported goods.\nHowever, the current range of available phytosanitary treatments remains limited. In many cases, existing methods lack proven efficacy against specific pests, or scientifically sound protocols are unavailable. Moreover, practical challenges related to the implementation, scalability, potential health and environmental impact of these treatments often hinder their widespread adoption.\nThis action aims to stimulate innovation in phytosanitary (post-harvest) treatment solutions [3] to be used in trade.\nProposals should:\n• develop innovative, cost-effective (post-harvest) phytosanitary treatment(s) to prevent the introduction of pests through imports, with a specific focus on EU quarantine pests [4] ;\n• test and validate the proposed treatment(s) considering economic, technical, human health and environmental dimensions;\n• asses the cost-effectiveness, feasibility, scalability and practical applicability of the proposed treatment(s) under operational conditions;\n• evaluate efficacy and specificity of the treatment(s), establishing scientifically sound and user-friendly protocols and operational guidelines to ensure consistent application, safety and regulatory compliance.\nProposals should either address Area A: treatment(s) applicable to wood and wood products or Area B: post-harvest treatment(s) for fruits and vegetables. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, test and demonstrate the innovative treatments solutions in diverse contexts involving SMEs.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the common agricultural policy, align with the Vision for Agriculture and Food, and support Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 on protective measures against pests of plants.\n[1] Treatment (as phytosanitary measures) is the official procedure for killing, inactivating, removing, rendering infertile or devitalizing regulated pest.

          "scope": "Agriculture and forestry face a growing challenge from the dual threat of a shrinking portfolio of active substances and increasing pests [1] resistance to treatments. Climate change compounds this issue by enabling pests to survive milder winters, expand their ranges, and increase their exposure to pesticides—accelerating the development of resistance. Addressing this complex issue requires a comprehensive, science-based systemic approach that integrates early detection, adaptive management, and long-term foresight to reduce resistance risks and strengthen the sustainability and resilience of agriculture and forestry. It is also relevant to acknowledge that while pesticides are important short-term solutions, the long-term solutions require shifts in current agriculture or forestry practices and system-level transformations within agri-food systems that would boost the resilience of these production environments, while preserving biodiversity.\nProposals should:\n• map resistance risks by assessing the current and projected emergence of pest resistance, considering the declining number of available active substances [2] and the authorised products for different crops;\n• develop early detection methods and predictive modelling (including AI-driven approaches) to anticipate and monitor the evolution of pesticide resistance, integrating advanced measurements tools and risk assessment methodologies, notably when products are used at farm level;\n• design and evaluate innovative integrated pest and weed management (IPWM) strategies that reduce resistance risks by expanding non-chemical preventive and curative options, optimising the rotation and combination of (agroecological) farming practices, and applying advanced technologies for precise and targeted pesticide use, while capitalising on the results of previous and ongoing initiatives;\n• innovate storage and handling practices to reduce resistance pressure during post-harvest stages;\n• support foresight activities to anticipate, mitigate and prevent resistance impacts by exploring interactions among technological, environmental, and socio-economic drivers, assessing planned resistance-management strategies against various future scenarios, establishing long-term resistance monitoring, and integrating foresight outputs into decision-making and adaptive management through collaboration across research, farming and forestry sectors, industry, stakeholder networks, and policymakers;\n• enhance capacity-building, stakeholder engagement and communication through awareness-raising, sensitisation, education, and the co-creation of solutions with end-users.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings, knowledge, solutions and tools, from past and ongoing projects and collaborate with ongoing initiatives.

          "scope": "Protein crops [1] can play a key role in advancing sustainable and resilient European agriculture offering environmental, agronomic, economic and nutritional benefits. Despite their potential, the production and use of protein crops in Europe remains limited and require targeted efforts to scale up. Several barriers continue to hinder their development, including the lack of adapted local protein crops for the different European environmental conditions, the limited availability of effective and safe pest management practices and tools, the inadequacy of the machinery used in their production, poor infrastructure for processing and marketing, the absence of well-established local value chains, etc. A key element for a wide adoption of protein crops by farmers is demonstrating their potential benefits (economic competitiveness, environmental impacts, social engagement, adaptability) that enhance their market value and appeal.\nProposals should:\n• develop innovative solutions tailored to different conditions across the EU (agro-climatic, edaphic, socio-economic), to address key challenges hindering the inclusion of protein crops into diverse cropping systems. This should be done at farm level (addressing for instance yield, quality, resource optimization and resilience of protein crops under varying climatic and soil conditions) as well as the whole agri-food value chain (such as access to marketing outlets), increasing the competitiveness of protein crops;\n• promote circular bioeconomy by valorising protein crops’ by-products to develop economically viable and resilient farming models that enhance farmer profitability and reduce production risks. Explore and demonstrate innovative pathways for converting protein crops’ by-products into safe feed and food sources. If relevant, build on already identified protein crop by-products and value chains to develop concrete case studies that showcase practical circular and successful business models;\n• develop or adapt innovative and scalable integrated pest [2] and weed management strategies tailored for protein crops to enhance crop resilience, soil health, and productivity across a wide range of production systems and climate conditions, while limiting the impact on the environment and ensuring food safety;\n• conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit evaluation of the proposed approaches and solutions to ensure overall feasibility across diverse farming system;\n• explore, test and adapt available machinery for sowing, field management, harvesting and postharvest operations, tailored to different protein crops. Consider, if relevant, the integration of digital/AI tools. Propose viable avenues for increasing access to this specific equipment, including through cooperatives/producers’ associations or collaborating with SMEs/startups;\n• support farmers to transition to the incorporation of protein crops in the European production systems by widely sharing practical knowledge through existing advisory networks, digital platforms or capacity building programmes and potentially deployed at large scale. Create diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, such as audiovisuals, brochures, presentations, that showcase innovations in a creative way, incorporating artistic elements for engaging storytelling.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together. An active participation of farmers, retailers, SMEs and consumers is encouraged, in local protein crops value chains, through the development of near-farm activities to drive local innovation. Beneficiaries. may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, engage SME’s or startups to develop, test and demonstrate the proposed innovative solutions.\nProposals should address diverse farming systems/approaches, including conventional and organic farming.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other relevant projects in particular those to be funded under the topic \"HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-05: Enhancing farmers profitability and resilience through innovations for diversified crops and value chains\".

This hinders the timely development of perennial breeds to cope with challenges like climate change, pests and diseases, impacting among others crop productivity. Developing user-friendly tools that can be effectively transferred to breeders will boost the impact and efficiency of breeding programs for perennial crops.\nProposals should:\n• develop new and/or improved tools and methods aimed at shortening generation time and overall breeding cycle in perennial crops, while enhancing sustainability traits such as pest and disease resistance, yield stability, quality and adaptation to climate changes;\n• assess the scalability and accessibility of the tools and methods and ensure the provision of the required dataset and info for their effective implementation;\n• implement genomic selection tools and models – taking into account interactions between genotypes and environment - into actual breeding schemes for perennial crops and study the empirical results of these models to determine their accuracy, reliability, and applicability and improve their effectiveness for commercial settings;\n• validate the tools across different species or breeding objectives to ensure reliability and replicability and develop standardized protocols and guidelines for their use in consultation with breeders to facilitate the effective adoption and utilisation of the tools/methods;\n• evaluate the newly developed tools and methods for potential trade-offs, unintended outcomes and potential effects on the environment.\nAll breeding approaches are in the scope of this topic. Proposals should target fruit and/or nut crops [1] .\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, cross-test the tools developed in different species and facilitate the engagement of SMEs for testing in commercial settings.\nProposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe and ensure collaboration with relevant ongoing projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructure [2] in the environment, biological and food domains.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food by promoting plant breeding innovations, including new genomic techniques (NGTs), the Commission communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU [3] and the Life Sciences Strategy.\n[1] According to the FAO Indicative Crop Classification (ICC) presented in the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020 (Annex 4 - Group 3, under the voice ’Fruit and nuts’), with the exclusion of berries.\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ .\n[3] COM (2024)137 final.",

          "scope": "Boosting circularity and diversification strategies of livestock production systems by integrating for example diverse animal breeds and species, multiple animal products and by-products, and sustainable land-use approaches like mixed crop-livestock systems and agroforestry can help to reduce environmental ad climate impact, to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, to minimize waste, and to enhance overall farming system resilience to environmental and economic shocks. Such strategies can provide alternative revenue streams (e.g., meat, dairy, wool, eggs, wood, fruit, manure, ecosystem services/carbon credits), improve farmers’ income stability, reduce dependency on external inputs and on single-product markets, and create more sustainable farms and rural economies.\nFarmers are increasingly interested in diverse and circular livestock farming strategies, but the efficiency, profitability, trade-offs, interactions, and co-benefits of these strategies vary by region, farm type, and economic conditions. The aim is to assess the real short- and long-term impact and scalability of these strategies in different pedo-climatic regions and in various terrestrial livestock systems, including organic farming. It is important to investigate local agricultural and agro-industrial resources, including residues, by-products and co-products that are not valorised to produce energy or bio-based chemicals for the wider bioeconomy (such as bioenergy, biopolymers/biomaterials), but instead remain within the farming system for circular uses such as animal feed, soil amendments, organic fertilizers, and other innovative uses.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n• develop and validate innovative strategies and tools, including monitoring systems, to optimize diversification and circularity in terrestrial livestock farming systems at multiple levels (e.g., animals, products, by-products, farm, land) and scales (spatial, organizational and temporal). This includes valorising resources, by-products, residues and waste, closing the nutrient loops, and enhancing resilience, sustainability, biodiversity and profitability while considering the specific local context and needs of rural areas, and ensuring that food safety is maintained;\n• foster the utilisation of locally available value-added products, co-products and by-products from terrestrial livestock farming systems, taking into account the EU regulatory framework and relevant standards, while assessing synergies, trade-offs, and possible interactions between resource use, efficiency, circularity and sustainability;\n• enhance exchange among the participants along the value chain of information, good practices and innovations on circularity and diversification, including logistic, governance and business models that help in sharing local resources, aggregating supply, improving the bargaining power of farmers through cooperative structures and preserving the cultural heritage related to traditional local rural production;\n• analyse the social and economic viability of the diversified and circular livestock farming systems, with particular attention to market trends and value chain analysis, including traceability, and their contribution to sustainable rural development;\n• provide scientific evidence and policy advice that support the assessment of the current EU regulatory framework relevant to the sector and to existing or novel products derived from animal and agricultural by-products.\nProposals should either address Area A: any terrestrial livestock production system or Area B: production system on the wool value chain (i.e. fiber animal production systems). The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Green Deal’s objectives for resilient and sustainable agri-food systems, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU climate policy and the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic production [1] .\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in animal husbandry in Europe, including farmers, shepherds and relevant organisations notably in the livestock sectors, territorial planners, advisors, private sector/industry (e.g. processors, retailers, distributors), policy-makers, consumers, etc.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects, where relevant.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

Examples of CEA include greenhouses, vertical farms, grow rooms, building-integrated agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, as well as other innovative farming practices - both off land and land based - where technological advancements enable precise regulation of growing conditions farming.\nBy developing innovative farming techniques that integrate the latest technological advancements including artificial intelligence (AI), this research should provide a competitive and sustainable transformation in response to global food security and sustainability challenges. Furthermore, it should also empower farmers and key stakeholders in the agricultural primary sector by enabling them to adopt sustainable, efficient, profitable, circular, and low-emission farming practices. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and AI-driven solutions, the activities should contribute to the overarching goals of climate neutrality and climate resilience, reinforcing the EU’s commitment to a sustainable agricultural future.\nProposals should:\n• develop and assess advanced cost-effective innovative and sustainable solutions (including nature-based solutions) to address the key challenges (including climate change related and environmental) for crop optimisation in CEA. The assessment should address, among other, crop health and yield, energy efficiency, water use efficiency, nutrient management, environmental conditions, cost-effectiveness, automation and technology integration, sustainability and environmental impact, food safety, pest and disease management, scalability and adaptability;\n• develop data-driven decision-making smart automation and precision farming techniques, as well as predictive analytics for plant growth optimisation (e.g. via AI modelling);\n• explore appropriate new business and cooperation models adapted to proposed solutions, taking into account organisation and distribution concepts, and marketability of the resulting products. Consider requirements from relevant EU regulatory frameworks including where relevant needs for pre-market authorisation;\n• foster knowledge sharing including by training to test and adopt the innovative solutions, and informed advice for improved competitiveness and sustainability of CEA.\nProposals should develop innovative solutions in both conventional and organic production systems. The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the European Green Deal policies dealing with environment protection and climate change, and the Apply AI Strategy.\nActivities should fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach and allow for adequate involvement of relevant actors including farmers, SMEs, start-ups, scientists and developers.\nTo effectively transition these innovations into the market, SMEs should actively be involved in this process. Activities are expected to achieve Technological Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.\nProposals may involve financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs providing and/or developing testing, or validating the proposed innovative technologies/solutions. A maximum 30% of EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings from past and ongoing research projects and especially seek synergy with the other project to be selected under this topic and with the project to be selected from the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-08: Exploring the potential of controlled environment agriculture (CEA).\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

          "scope": "The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU’s Vision for Agriculture and Food by strengthening the plant protection ecosystem and supporting a future-proof, resilient agricultural sector.\nThe EU ambition to reduce the use of harmful pesticides is important for the long-term resilience of farming, health and environmental protection. However, the introduction of alternatives in the form of biological or innovative low-risk plant protection products has not followed with the same pace as the withdrawal of active substances from the EU market. If this trend continues, it could affect the EU’s ability to ensure food security and sovereignty.\nTo ensure a smooth transition, coordinated action is needed. Strengthening dialogue, guiding research, and supporting innovation should equip policymakers and sectors to adapt and build a resilient, nature and biodiversity-friendly crop protection system.\nProposals should:\n• establish or reinforce an inclusive, multi-actor platform for an EU-wide network to facilitate dialogue, knowledge exchange, cooperation among policymakers, regulatory bodies, farmer organisations, researchers, industry actors, and other stakeholders;\n• provide guidance to identify critical uses of active substances at risk of withdrawal, assess potential agronomic and economic impacts and map existing alternatives, including those that support agro-biodiversity, and research needs;\n• facilitate targeted discussions to prioritise the most affected crops and regions, define pathways for the development and adoption of alternative solutions with a priority on issues where a risk of deadlock situation has been identified as a result of the withdrawal of harmful pesticides, and shape strategic research and innovation agendas;\n• support agricultural sectors in co-developing actionable plans — from early-stage research to field-level deployment — that address the impacts of substance withdrawals and foster mutual learning across sectors and EU Member States.\nProposals should consider the perspectives and needs of the different 27 EU Member States to ensure a high level of representation. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The participation could involve contributing to prioritization of critical active substances based on the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of the pests controlled by the active substances and assessment of the acceptability of alternative solutions by agents in the food system.\nProposals should capitalise on relevant research findings and tools, included those developed under previous research projects and collaborate with projects funded in HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-02: Tackling pesticide resistance: early detection, management strategies, and foresight.",

          "scope": "The world’s migratory species are in decline, and their global extinction risk is increasing, with a growing part of this acceleration linked to climate change and a deterioration of their migration routes. Migratory marine fish stocks - ranging across a wide size spectrum - are vital for ecosystem functioning and food security, as their long-term persistence depends on management approaches that balance sustainability with ecological resilience in a system of global change. Furthermore, diadromous fish species play a critical role in land-sea interactions across their ranges, providing unique financial and non-financial societal goods and benefits to society and nature, such as marine-derived nutrient flows to rivers and lands, and exceptional cultural values. Ability of these species to connect and utilise a variety of habitats over long distances, makes them 'umbrella' species, meaning conservation measures for these species benefit broader ecosystems. Protecting these species and sustainably managing the bio-resources they provide across national and international waters, and often multi-national catchments require a holistic and coordinated approach, integrating local attitudes, uses, knowledge, policies and conservation measures, and adapted to local circumstances where necessary.\nProposals should:\n• develop methods and methodologies, where relevant at regional scale or global scale, to assess the effectiveness of conservation and management measures that will allow for adaptive management;\n• develop tools and practices to reduce anthropogenic mortality factors for these species and in all key lifetime aquatic habitats and to avoid fragmented non-coordinated management across sectors and countries;\n• generate new knowledge on the interplay between climatic and non-climatic pressures, particularly related to fisheries of marine species, or in relation to infrastructure impeding connectivity (e.g. hydropower, pumping stations, flood control) and pollution for the diadromous species;\n• assess the impact of emerging pressures on the migratory species of interest;\n• assess the ecosystem services and the resulting societal goods and benefits provided by long-ranging migrating and/or transboundary land-sea-connecting species;\n• strengthen data collection systems covering all life-history stages and successive key habitats of these migratory fish, to improve monitoring coordination across regions and countries;\n• incorporate relevant stakeholders and end-users from the design phase through development and implementation, ensuring that outputs can be readily applied by them.\nThe scope includes migratory marine and diadromous species of commercial interest, with particular emphasis on endangered species and endangered local populations. Where applicable, considerations related to farming of migratory species should be addressed.\nProposals should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities disciplines. Citizen science is encouraged at all stages of the research activities for this topic.\nProjects are expected to contribute to the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the European Ocean Pact, the Vision for Fisheries and Aquaculture with a 2040 perspective, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directives, the Water Framework Directive, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the Food 2030 policy framework, the Nature Restoration Regulation.",

The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.As a co-funded European Partnership, providing financial support to third parties (FSTP) is a core activity of this action in order to achieve its objectives. Consequently, the EUR 60 000 threshold laid down in Article 207 of Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 does not apply. The maximum amount of FSTP that may be awarded to any single third party is set at EUR 10 million. This ceiling is justified by the fact that FSTP is a primary activity of this action, by its expected duration of 7–10 years (exceeding a standard project lifespan), and by the extensive experience gained under predecessor partnerships.\nThe starting date of grants awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the application. Applicants must justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their application.

The third instalment of the partnership is expected to contribute to expected outcomes specified in topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1.",
          "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership for a climate-neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy (SBEP) identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of the existing topic and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in year 2022 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented, in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to the initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe scope of the application for this call on the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership should focus on the 2023-27 programmes according to the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years. It should pursue alignment, cooperation and structuring of research and innovation efforts across the EU and national levels, focusing on regional seas and on the objectives of the EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and of the European Ocean Pact, to support a just and inclusive transition to a regenerative, carbon-neutral and circular blue economy and to foster knowledge exchange and co-creation of actions with regulators, policymakers and businesses. It should also continue or expand the priority areas identified in the Strategic Research & Innovation Agenda, promoting R&I alignments across national, regional, and EU levels, and fostering integration across science, industry, governance, and society. The partnership will focus on multiple strategic areas like ocean health, sustainable blue economy, digital twins, and citizen well-being, while aligning with EU policies such as the European Green Deal and other directives. It should recognise the diversity of citizens to be involved and the vulnerability of different groups when approaching different analyses, and develop more inclusive recommendations. The Partnership should consolidate relevant structuring activities and propose additional ones (potentially done by additional partners) aiming at promoting Blue Economy Innovations, contributing to the development of the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS), for instance by facilitating and promoting coordination of cross-border ocean and coastal observations programmes, at increasing the availability of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data for environmental, climate and blue economy purposes, at exploiting the opportunities offered by Artificial Intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, etc.\nThe partnership is expected to continue to organise joint calls as part of the additional activities and therefore it should factor in ample time to run the co-funded projects.\nThe partnership's additional activities are expected to be designed and described in such a way that it is clear how they will increase scientific contributions, applicable in a legal/regulatory context, and how they will facilitate the use of scientific knowledge by regulators and policymakers and support the development of a sustainable blue economy. The additional activities are expected to be implemented through the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of researchers from different disciplines, advisors, local, regional and national authorities, government representatives, industry and businesses, including SMEs, knowledge institutions and citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and other relevant actors of the value chain, supported through Open Science practices and an inclusive governance, policy and decision-making.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.\nTaking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-1 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and additional partners, if any, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement. The proposal should also describe the specific activities foreseen to strengthen the synergies with other related Missions and Partnerships.",

          "scope": "Knowledge gaps exist between agricultural policy priorities and data infrastructure to evaluate social sustainability issues, particularly regarding farmers. Often social issues are addressed by various policy instruments from different policy areas, but there are inconsistencies, for example in the way that target groups are identified and measured in the statistics collected at European level. A framing of the social dimension of agriculture is necessary to complement the existing environmental and economic aspects of sustainability of assessment tools, strategies and policies for agriculture in the EU. Social issues may remain hidden if there is no consistent data able to capture them. Social aspects seem to be excluded from most of the analytical tools available. Greater understanding of social issues and the best policy approaches to address them requires appropriate data to develop better indicators and measurement that can be integrated into analytical tools. Successful proposals should therefore directly and/ or indirectly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance of the sector, including social sustainability, and competitiveness in agriculture.\nProposals should:\n• identify the social impacts of agriculture on farmers (e.g., employment, demography, migration, distributional aspects, procedural justice, inclusiveness, health and well-being, social integration, gender equality, etc.), by considering various type of agricultural activities and farming methods (including organic farming) at various geographical scales, from local, national, EU to global levels;\n• map, assess and address gaps in data, indicators, and modelling approaches currently lacking social perspective by considering various type of agricultural activities and farming methods (including organic farming) to improve the assessment of social performance including determinants, synergies, trade-offs and benefits;\n• advance access, harmonize and improve interoperability of evidence/data available from observational, qualitative or case-study approaches to complement quantitative research methods. Examine networking structures to reach all relevant actors, interactions and relations, both work- and life-related;\n• test, demonstrate and pilot promising new/improved indicators, models, tools and approaches to assess social performance;\n• identify and address challenges for the EU, Member States and regions to deploy social sustainability principles in the agricultural sector and provide policy recommendations to overcome them.\n• provide recommendations on how to improve the social sustainability of the agricultural sector and ensure a just transition;\n• widely disseminate and share knowledge and solutions to policymakers, farmers, businesses and other relevant end-users in order to facilitate their uptake.\nProposals under this topic should support EU ambitions related to the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , and contribute to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food for 2040 aiming at an agri-food system that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, and thus attractive, competitive, future-proof and fair for current and future generations. Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the CAP to promote fair jobs and social inclusion for farmers, the successful proposal should support the development of innovative governance models by providing strong evidence-based knowledge and analytical capacity to support its implementation. Proposals should as well support the development and implementation of the future CAP post 2027.\nNew interdisciplinary knowledge combining economic and social sciences offer a new perspective on agricultural sciences in which social elements could be the starting point for sustainability evaluations of agricultural systems. To this purpose, proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, demography, behavioural science and education.\nProposals are expected to take into consideration the results of other related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant EU-funded projects and initiatives.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the iMAP modelling platform, sharing of information, and contribution to dissemination of results.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29",

          "scope": "Tackling ocean and coastal challenges for the long term requires creating new knowledge, community acceptance and engagement, difficult decisions and strategic investments. This requires cooperation across generations, cultures, geographies and sectors.\nBuilding on past cooperative efforts under the Galway and Belém Statements, the AAORIA Declaration, and the related actions from successive EU Framework Programmes, proposals should contribute to upscaling collaboration across the Atlantic Ocean and promote its sustainable management, including its northern and southern parts and links to polar areas. This includes connecting scientists, stakeholders from public and private sectors, indigenous communities, civil society, and various generations, sectors, and disciplines with data, knowledge, expertise, and resources for the benefit All-Atlantic community. This also requires that proposals develop an All-Atlantic Intergenerational Programme to open access to knowledge, effective knowledge transfer, and stakeholder engagement in an intergenerational context.\nIn particular, the proposals should:\n• consolidate and support existing and new AAORIA initiatives in the priority areas identified in the 2022 AAORIA Declaration, ensuring their long-term self-sustainability;\n• contribute with professional support to the coordination, monitoring, communication, and outreach activities of the Alliance, as well as to organisation of the annual AAORIA Forums;\n• foresee actions to incorporate new Partners and supporters in AAORIA;\n• support an overarching All-Atlantic Intergenerational Cooperation Programme with an integrated platform and network by implementing key actions such as: strengthening research and training capacity in ocean science diplomacy, governance and international cooperation; engagement and cooperation with relevant private initiatives, etc. through activities such as summer schools, an annual intergenerational event for knowledge transfer between generations and hosting of the Atlantic Ocean Decade network of the Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOP); creating and supporting an Atlantic network complementing the Our Shared Ocean Initiative and benefiting Small Island Developing States (SIDS); it should engage coastal communities through the Coastal Resilience Beacon Sites Network and explore innovative cooperation models, such as the Floating Universities Network. To support the network, the proposals should develop an open access platform; establishing and supporting an annual high-level event to promote intergenerational dialogue and a healthy and peaceful Atlantic region; maximising visibility and policy impact through global forums such as the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and the G20; creating an independent fund through building partnerships with the private sector and philanthropic organisations to ensure financial support to Atlantic intergenerational cooperation, with a particular focus on providing financial support for ECOPs from Low and Middle Income Countries, as well as the Atlantic and the Caribbean SIDS.\nProposals should link with relevant international bodies such as IOC-UNESCO supporting the All-Atlantic contributions to the UN Decade of Ocean Science, and facilitate dialogue and synergies with EU Missions and Partnerships relevant for the All-Atlantic work, as well as relevant EU projects, such as those resulting from topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-COMMUNITIES-03.\nProposals should ensure broad participation across generations, disciplines, and geographical regions through a strong involvement of citizens/civil society, academia/research, industry/SMEs and government/public authorities, as well as cooperation with philanthropists. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is mandatory. Consortia submitting proposals to this topic are encouraged to include in particular participants from AAORIA Partner countries [1] and other Atlantic coastal nations.\n[1] Home - All Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance",

          "scope": "Open-source geospatial software ecosystems form a critical digital infrastructure for climate services, agriculture, biodiversity, environmental monitoring, and beyond. While Europe is home to world-class developers and software assets used globally and presenting the backbone to the modern geospatial sector (e.g. GDAL, QGIS, Pangeo stack, etc), their long-term sustainability remains challenged by fragmented, voluntary support, low visibility in funding and investment channels, and limited access to business knowledge and opportunity tailored to open-source development models.\nImportantly, many open-source projects already operate at high technology readiness levels (TRL), with active user communities, broad adoption, and demonstrated product-market fit. However, these projects often lack the business frameworks and institutional support necessary to facilitate long-term sustainability, resilience and European software sovereignty. Their challenges are distinct from those of early-stage research projects or conventional start-ups, and they require tailored approaches to governance, licensing, service monetization, and maintenance.\nTo address open-source geospatial specific challenges, proposals under this topic should:\n• establish a business incubation and support hub for the geospatial open-source community in Europe, acting as a single-entry point to foster entrepreneurship and sustained open development across critical geospatial open-source projects. To this end, the hub should identify and develop pathways for open-source geospatial software communities to partake in viable business opportunities, fostering innovation and entrepreneurial growth within the open-source ecosystem and working towards long-term sustainability of the critical geospatial open-source software ecosystem;\n• analyse the European market and innovation landscape, to identify current and future demands for geospatial open-source software across public and private sectors, identify gaps and business opportunities for commercial uptake of open-source software and the creation of business models;\n• in collaboration with the European geospatial and open-source communities, including established organisations, such as NumFOCUS, OSGeo, Linux Foundation and others, proposals should identify, and catalogue critical geospatial open-source software projects, and support fundamental, mature open-source projects with high TRL and demonstrated user traction in developing sustainability and sovereignty strategies, including tailored business strategies, IP models (where applicable), and investment readiness, to bridge the gap between open innovation and venture-ready business opportunities.\nProposals should include capacity-building elements and services, such as business mentoring, legal and IP advice, training on licensing and open business models, match making with investors, alignment with European Innovation Council (EIC) selection criteria, and community-building actions for the critical geospatial open-source projects. The applicants should furthermore plan facilitating pathways from critical open-source software to Venture Capital support, such as EIC support instruments, including Transition and Accelerator programmes.\nProposals should foresee a range of 45-60% of the proposed budget for providing financial support to third parties (FSTP), with the aim of establishing seed funding mechanisms to aid identified critical geospatial open-source projects and associated entities established in EU and Horizon Europe associated countries. In accordance with the developed critical open-source software to business and sustainability pathways, these Grants should aid critical open-source projects to implement measures to start identified business opportunities with activities such as administrative and legal set-up, productisation, business development, branding and marketing, etc.",

          "scope": "On-farm demonstrations can be crucial for enabling innovation uptake in agriculture, as they provide a platform for showcasing and evaluating new practices, but also serve as an effective avenue for peer-to-peer (or farmer to farmer) learning, leading to skill empowerment, higher adoption rates and increased practice change compared to the traditional top-down approaches. By engaging in on-farm demonstrations, farmers are better positioned to assess the applicability of innovative practices or tools. Complementing on-farm demonstrations with comprehensive cost-benefit analyses further empowers farmers, allowing them to quantitively evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the adoption of new solutions/practices. This approach should not only promote informed decision-making but also accelerate the uptake and integration of innovative practices across the agricultural sector. Proposals should either address Area A: Crop production systems, or Area B: Livestock and mixed production systems. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the proposal.\nProposals should:\n• develop objective benchmarking criteria to select agricultural innovations, considering factors such as their impact, ease of implementation, scalability and applicability across different agricultural systems;\n• develop and apply a standardised methodology to assess the economic, environmental (including biodiversity effects), and social impacts of adopting these innovations, with focus on the analysis of the costs and benefits for the practitioners;\n• screen and select promising practice-oriented innovative solutions developed by research and innovation projects in the area of agriculture to be tested on-farm and by farmers, on the basis of the objective benchmarking criteria;\n• test, validate and showcase the innovative solutions in real conditions directly on- farms across different geographic realities in real conditions, and thoroughly analyse their costs and benefits for the practitioners. It is essential that proposals ensure complementarity and cooperation with existing and future peer-to-peer and on-farm demo activities in their planning and avoid overlaps and repetitions, ensuring geographical coverage of the EU;\n• develop and widely share learning materials and courses, and incentivise peer-to-peer learning by organising, e.g., cross-border field visits and farmer-centred webinars presenting the most effective innovative solutions to farmers and advisors.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of relevant actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating advisors, farmers and/or foresters and/or rural actors. To effectively support the transition of innovations into the market, the participation of startups and SMEs is strongly encouraged.\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, develop, test and demonstrate innovative measures. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose. Particular efforts [1] in outreach and communication should be made by the project to help publicise these calls to the stakeholder targeted as beneficiaries of the support.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the cross-cutting objective of the common agricultural policy (CAP) to enhance knowledge flows and the adoption of innovation among AKIS [2] actors, in particular advisory services and end-users [3] .\n[1] activities that go beyond the minimum requirements set out in General Annex B.\n[2] AKIS is defined in Article 3(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115.\n[3] An “(end-)user” of R&I result(s) is a person who is him/herself putting the results into practice (i.e. practitioner); depending on the area selected, end-users could be farmers and/or other rural actors, or both of them.",

          "scope": "Farmers are exposed to numerous and increasing risks and crises of diverse nature and scale, putting pressure on their wellbeing, business viability and income. So far, available risk and crisis management tools have been insufficient in addressing the growing needs for strengthening resilience capacities. There is a need for more knowledge and solutions adapted to the diversity of farming systems and contexts. This would enable more integrated management of risks and crises, leading to more effective emergency response and adequate prevention and management on the long term. Proposals should target one or more risks and crises (e.g., sanitary, environmental, economic, geopolitical, ecological, demographic, technological) that are causing, or likely to cause, significant socio-economic impacts directly or indirectly affecting EU farmers, considering among others potential compound and amplifier effects under climate change and biodiversity loss.\nThe actions funded under this topic should support the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the Common Agricultural Policy.\nProposals should:\n• improve understanding of farmers’ individual and collective options, strategies, incentives, behaviour and decision-making regarding uncertainties, risk and crisis management. This work should capture the context in which farmers operate, including interactions with other agri-food supply chain operators, critical dependencies, as well as market conditions and policies;\n• assess the anticipation, robustness and adaptation capacities of farms, costs and benefits of action vs. non-action, and the interactions between risk management, crisis management and the adoption of preventive practices on farms, at landscape level and/or along agri-food supply chains. This work should also analyse the transformative capacities of farms in response to challenges that make business as usual not viable or not possible;\n• propose inclusive solutions, improve and develop integrated risk and crisis management strategies, at farm and landscape level and/or along the agri-food supply chain, to improve the resilience of farming systems. Proposed solutions should consider different types of production and the risk perceptions of practitioners, and they should be adapted to the practitioners’ risk preferences and resilience requirements. This work should also include an assessment of the costs and benefits of the solutions;\n• propose criteria and measures to improve fair risk sharing along the agri-food supply chain and for derisking, to mitigate economic risks for farmers;\n• test the proposed strategies and/or measures, using an experimental approach. Proposals are encouraged to build for this purpose on existing participatory infrastructures (e.g., demonstration sites, living labs, etc);\n• support inclusive and accessible capacity building, training, and education on risk and crisis management for farmers and other relevant agri-food supply chain operators (“risk literacy”);\n• consider compound and amplifier effects of climate change and biodiversity loss on other types of risks and crises in all activities whenever appropriate and relevant.\nProposals should assess and compare options and strategies developed by farmers implementing various farming approaches, one of which should be organic farming.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The JRC’s participation could involve contributing to the understanding of farmer risk preferences, measurement and design of risk sharing alternatives for the agri-food supply chain and testing alternatives using experimental methods.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. They should also ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects, including from the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Soil. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies (e.g., fi-compass studies), projects, initiatives and processes.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.).

          "scope": "The agri-food sector is an important pillar to EU competitiveness. It is composed of diversified businesses representing around 15% of total EU employment and contributes to provide essential services and secure a stable and affordable supply of food to EU citizens. The concept of agricultural competitiveness is complex and approached with different perspectives and methodologies in the scientific literature. EU policies aim at addressing a growing number of objectives in a challenging and evolving context (e.g., climate change, biodiversity loss, geopolitical tensions, fast digitalisation). There is a need to update knowledge and tools on agricultural competitiveness. This should contribute to improve our capacity to design and implement agricultural policies, effective in navigating and addressing multiple objectives while enabling green and digital transitions without undermining our competitiveness over time. Successful proposals under this topic should support the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Competitiveness Compass, the Common Agricultural Policy, the sustainability objectives (including on climate and biodiversity) of the Green Deal, and the SDGs.\nProposals should:\n• address analytical gaps on competitiveness to better account for their various drivers, inputs (including land, labour, capital), components (e.g., costs, price, innovation capacity, investment capacity, market share, market position, resilience, knowledge, skills, productivity, product quality, differentiation) and impacts (economic, environmental and social). Consider various value chains and farming systems in different regions, one of which should be organic farming. This activity should integrate knowledge from different disciplines (e.g., economics, management, agronomy, environmental sciences);\n• improve the capacity to analyse agriculture-related policies supporting and recognising sustainable practices (such as supporting climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development goals) across the value chain (e.g., due diligence, deforestation-free products) and in trade agreements, in particular their capacity to support competitiveness and resilience objectives, and to mitigate leakage effects;\n• provide evidence on the social, economic and environmental drivers of competitiveness, synergies, trade-offs between the sustainability dimensions, at and between different stages of the value chain (including farm-level, producer organisations, upstream and downstream operators etc.) as well as spatial (local to global) and time scales (short to long term). Proposals are encouraged to consider different lengths of value chains (e.g., short, mid-tier, global), business strategies (e.g., economies of scale, specialisation and agglomeration vs economies of scope) and marketing strategies (e.g., quality differentiation);\n• identify, improve and/or develop adequate indicators and metrics, and collect the necessary data, to improve the measurement of performance, sustainability, resilience, productivity and competitiveness in analytical tools. This work should take into account the practical needs of decision-makers and the context of their operations (e.g., international versus local strategy). Particular attention should be paid to prioritising relevant robust indicators that could be replicated in different countries;\n• provide recommendations and propose levers to anticipate trade-offs and conciliate competitiveness, resilience and sustainability objectives in business strategies and policies and support the long-term prosperity of the agricultural sector.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools and ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies, projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., competitiveness check).\nThe JRC’s participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the iMAP modelling platform, sharing of information and contribution to dissemination of results.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, businesses and other relevant actors from agri-food supply chains.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Mediterranean countries.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.",

          "scope": "Generational renewal is a prerequisite for European farming systems to remain resilient and competitive in the medium and long term. The actions funded under this topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food and the objective to shape an attractive farming and agri-food sector for future generations. To accomplish this, it is important to provide active support and specialised trainings for newcomers and young farmers. Advisors are best placed to accompany, monitor and mentor new farmers in the different stages of setting up and managing new farms. In addition, they can support new farmers in building social networks from a professional point of view and provide guidance on the different needs of takeovers and new farms. They can also contribute to advance gender equality and inclusion in this sector.\nA novelty in the current CAP strategic plans is that advisors should be integrated within the AKIS as well as be impartial, competent and up to date on scientific and innovation developments [1] . They should be able to translate the knowledge and provide concrete, targeted and practical solutions for farmers adapted to specific local circumstances.\nProposals should:\n• foster in-depth exchange of knowledge and experiences among advisors across the EU on the needs of young farmers and new entrants to successfully enter and run an agricultural business in the long-term;\n• develop and widely share diverse useful resources, tools and approaches, including learning materials and courses, new business strategies/plans, cross-border visits, internships and other initiatives that should empower advisors to effectively support young and/or new farmers in addressing the identified needs for taking over / entering and staying in the farming sector;\n• equip advisors to deliver guidance and support throughout the various stages of farm establishment. This should include offering guidance on various preparatory steps such as securing land, exploring financing options, and crafting business strategies. Advisors should also help farmers navigate practical elements like technology use, financial management, legal matters, and sustainable farming practices addressing among others climate change and biodiversity loss. Additionally, they should address challenges that arise in the early years of farm development. Special attention should be given to promoting generational transfer, helping older farmers plan for and facilitate farm succession;\n• involve advisors in an innovative EU-wide communication and awareness-rising campaigns to reposition farming as an attractive and rewarding career choice for the young generations;\n• ensure collaborations with national or regional authorities and AKIS ecosystems to promote the project outputs and ensure that they will be updated and maintained in the long-term beyond the project duration.\nThe proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders. Minimum 50% of the number of the people involved in the project should be impartial advisors spending at least half of their time on giving advice to farmers. A plan for financial sustainability and maintenance of the EU advisory network in the long-term beyond the project duration should be included in the proposal.\n[1] In line with the Article 15(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 , Member States shall ensure that the advice given is impartial and that advisors are suitably qualified, appropriately trained and have no conflict of interest.",

          "scope": "Agriculture and forestry are among the sectors most directly impacted by climate change, while also playing important roles in its mitigation, through greenhouse gas emissions, their reduction and carbon removals from the atmosphere. These roles are addressed in horizontal EU climate policies such as the Regulations on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) [1] and on Effort-sharing [2] or the forthcoming Climate Adaptation Plan, as well as in sectoral policies, most notably the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with a host of relevant rules and voluntary measures. The climate performance in agriculture and forestry is indirectly also affected by many other policies and measures, be they sectoral (e.g., on market organisation or on income support) or horizontal (e.g., on competitiveness). Depending on their design and application, climate policies in turn also have impacts beyond their immediate objectives, e.g. on competitiveness, income distribution, and biodiversity and nature protection. Apart from policies applicable in the EU and its Member States and in Associated Countries, the outcomes in each of these jurisdictions are also impacted by rules and standards applied in other parts of the world, through international markets and other transboundary effects.\nWhile efforts are made in some contexts to expand the scope of regular policy evaluations, so that they also include “external factors” and unintended consequences, this poses significant challenges methodologically and in terms of data and thus often remains an afterthought in analyses focused on individual policies or sectors. There is a need for more aggregate consideration of the full spectrum of levers impacting on climate outcomes, in a comparative and systemic perspective, with a view to improving the overall effectiveness, fairness and coherence of public policies.\nProposals should:\n• making use inter alia of advanced technological potentials for accelerated evidence synthesis, take stock of existing analyses and evidence on the performance of sectoral and horizontal instruments affecting climate-change mitigation and adaptation in the agricultural and forestry sectors, also in terms of the distribution of costs and benefits within and across sectors and societies;\n• design and carry out research to fill gaps in the understanding of the above questions, covering a broad range of policy instruments across relevant outcomes and include compound effects on other policy objectives as well as spill-overs from climate-relevant policies with a different (primary) objective, including biodiversity and nature protection;\n• for the agricultural and forestry sectors address adaptation as well as mitigation-related policies and outcomes and assess how (and with how much success) their interconnections have been reflected in relevant policies and institutions, identifying relevant enabling conditions;\n• develop frameworks for assessing overall policy outcomes across potentially conflicting objectives and identify specific leverage points for realistically improving aggregate outcomes, taking into account any existing review processes or mechanisms.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures in the environmental, biological and food domains.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 02018R0841-20230511 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] Regulation - 2023/857 - EN - EUR-Lex",

          "scope": "Water infrastructures both for drinking water supply and wastewater collection and treatment suffer from a lack of sufficient and continuous investment across Europe. Their conditions are evolving differently depending on the investment capacity of local authorities and/or water companies, as well as the climate and pollution conditions they are exposed to. They are often not flexible enough to adapt to a changing and increasingly unpredictable environment and lack of appropriate monitoring to properly understand their functioning in various operating conditions. On the treatment side, the technological processes are not always coping with pollution load variation or new contaminants threatening human health and downstream ecosystems. They are also more and more exposed to the risk of malicious attacks, being of human or cyber nature.\nWith the effect of climate change as well as the emergence of new threats from chemical, biological, human and cyber origins, it is necessary to develop and test a set of tools to ensure that water and sanitation provision is resilient now and for the future, building on the solutions that emerged in the sector or adapted from other sectors.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should address some or all the elements below:\n• develop and integrate modular processes and tools to improve the adaptability of drinking water and wastewater infrastructures to emerging pollutions and effects of climate change;\n• integrate Nature-based Solutions infrastructures to reduce the carbon footprint of water infrastructure, better manage water flows and pollutants entering sewers, and support biodiversity;\n• enhance the use of digital solutions, new monitoring techniques, Earth observation tools, digital twin technology and artificial intelligence, including for predictive analytics, within drinking water and wastewater infrastructures to optimise their operation, anticipate infrastructure challenges and pollution and improve their efficiency and resilience, addressing leakages, infiltration, energy consumption, recovery of materials and carbon footprint;\n• develop robust data sharing framework to promote secure collaboration among stakeholders and identify interdependencies with other critical infrastructures in a resilience-based approach;\n• develop tools, approaches and procedures to protect both the physical and digital water infrastructures against malicious attacks.\nProposals are encouraged to explore the use of blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to ensure data integrity, enable smart-contract–based service automation, and support novel financing or certification schemes for future water infrastructures. Given the high degree of integration of the topic with existing infrastructures, proposals should target a large variety of stakeholders ranging from universities, SMEs, water utilities, energy utilities, etc.\nProposals should also seek to contribute to the further development of existing observing platforms and initiatives, including to the evolution of Copernicus services and the future EU Digital Twin on freshwater and Destination Earth. It should also contribute to define the bases for a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) sharing of data in the water sector in collaboration with the initiative conducted by the co-funded partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All).\nAll in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories (e.g. Copernicus). supported by the European Commission.\nProposals should also build on the results of previous projects funded under previous framework programmes, especially the projects related to the cluster ICT4Water. They should also foster complementarities and avoid overlapping with projects funded under the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030 and the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change. Finally, it should also look for collaboration with projects from Horizon Europe Cluster 3 in relation to security, where appropriate. The JRC may contribute with technical analysis and research on digital technologies for water management and monitoring, including real-world test cases.\nInternational cooperation is strongly encouraged.",

With a view of contributing with breakthrough innovation to this strategy, proposals are expected to address creative or disruptive solutions to develop a set of means for its implementation. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed activities, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of appropriate stakeholders, including where relevant farmers, water intensive industries, energy producers, land managers, water governance bodies and local authorities. Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at local, national and EU level for possible next steps after the project. In this topic the integration of the gender and intersectional dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Proposals should consider and possibly expand on previous research of related past national or EU-funded projects, avoiding duplication.\nProposals should address one or more of the following actions:\nRestore the Water Cycle\n• uptake of innovative solutions to help retain water in natural ecosystems at regional level, including groundwater, to restore free flowing and renaturalising river shapes, to promote water-efficient practices and optimised soil-water interactions, to implement the source-to-sea approach and supporting biodiversity;\n• increase preparedness against water scarcity, droughts and floods, and integrate global change adaptation strategies, including climate-resilient water infrastructure, early warning systems, and risk assessments to enhance the resilience of water systems to future climate impacts;\n• improve hydrological and ecological monitoring to better assess the impacts of various water resources management actions and interventions, while facilitating cross-border collaboration and open access to data.\nWater smart economies\n• in line with the water efficiency first principle, identify techniques or methodologies and their advantages and develop indicators for water efficiency in various water consuming sectors, e.g. agriculture;\n• develop and propose water pricing systems and certification systems that rewards sustainable land management practices and that promote the efficient provision of water services and the efficient use of water;\n• propose a set of innovative technological and digital solutions for the water (services) sector and water user sectors, to promote a water-smart economy and to implement the water efficiency first principle;\n• develop and upscale innovative water reuse and recycling solutions, including potable applications where appropriate, contributing to circular water use.\nEnsuring clean and affordable water for all\n• analyse the barriers that prevent public participation and engagement and developing actions to increase public awareness and engagement in drinking water resource protection and river basin management plans;\n• develop cost effective measures to ensure equitable access to affordable water and sanitation for groups in vulnerable situations such as women, children, elder people, low-income communities, indigenous peoples, or persons with disabilities LGBTIQ people, people with a racial or religious minority background;\n• develop methodologies to improve the influence of water footprint over consumption processes/patterns.\nProposals covering more than one action are not required to make links between the different actions if there is not. However, they should convincingly explain how their proposed actions are expected to contribute to the achievement of the expected outcomes they address.\nProposals should leverage relevant Copernicus elements and foster complementarities, avoiding overlaps with projects funded under previous Framework Programmes, the Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All), the EU Missions 'Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030', 'Adaptation to Climate Change' and 'A Soil Deal for Europe'. Proposals should include a task to ensure collaboration with the other projects funded under this topic. It should reinforce the complementarities of approaches and methodologies developed and maximise the outcome of the topic for the different actions foreseen.\nJRC can support the awarded consortium with its expertise and work on current, emerging, and future risks associated with water-related extremes such as droughts and floods, and with its efforts to enhance the drought and flood components of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service.\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/topics/environment/water-resilience-strategy_en",

However, not all territories have equal access to resources and opportunities. Efforts to enhance competitiveness must therefore also prioritise environmental and social sustainability ensuring that neither nature nor people are left behind in the pursuit of economic growth.\nAlthough rural areas often possess natural resources and are essential to support the provision of ecosystem services, they frequently face societal (e.g., declining and ageing populations, social exclusion and inequality) and market failures (e.g., under-provision of essential services, limited access to finance and infrastructure, digital divide, labour market mismatches) that hinder sustainable development, social inclusion, and competitiveness.\nProposals should:\n• improve the understanding of the drivers and obstacles of sustainable competitiveness in the contexts of societal and market failures in rural areas, and propose indicators to measure competitiveness that incorporate social and environmental performance;\n• support startups and/or businesses led by young [1] rural entrepreneurs to design, prototype and test sustainable digital, technological, nature-based and/or social solutions to improve access to services and/or create business opportunities in diverse rural settings; in addition, propose mechanisms to share these solutions among rural areas through translocal networks;\n• improve access to digital and hybrid education and training for rural communities to acquire new skills and support entrepreneurial mind-sets, in particular among young people, as well as link university graduates with young rural entrepreneurs to share knowledge and possibly create new collaborations;\nProposals may provide financial support to third parties in particular to support start up or businesses.

          "scope": "Insects play a vital role contributing to ecosystem functions in addition to pollination, such as decomposition and nutrient cycles, soil formation (including carbon sequestration) and pest control, control functions essential for maintaining ecosystem complexity, and are an indispensable part of the food chain. Those functions are key for climate change mitigation and allow the provision of ecosystem services which have economic benefits and support human well-being. Additionally, insects play a key role in other socioeconomic areas such as medical and pharmaceutical applications (e.g. antimicrobial peptides), forensic science or biotechnology.\nThe dramatic decline of insects, estimated around 75% in the last three decades, is raising increasing concern among scientists and in the public, since it could have far-reaching implications. In order to be able to tackle this decline, there is a need to improve our understanding of the drivers of loss and how they interplay. A better knowledge of insects themselves is necessary.\nWith targets 4 and 5 of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU took, among others, the commitment that by 2030 habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend and status, at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend, and that the decline of pollinators is reversed. According to the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, Member States shall put in place appropriate and effective measures to improve pollinator diversity and reverse the decline of pollinators by 2030. This is reflected in target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in which they should promote Nature-based Solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation. These policies and legislations have reached the implementation stage in the EU and worldwide.\nSuccessful proposals are expected to:\n• improve understanding and identification of insects’ diversity, including through genomic approaches;\n• focus on less known insect groups. In particular a solid knowledge has already been generated regarding pollination and pollinating insects through past and ongoing projects, therefore they are not expected to be subject to new research under this topic;\n• assess the status and trends of insects and analyse multiple drivers affecting them, as well as the ecosystem services that insects provide, at different spatial scales. A comprehensive integrative taxonomy approach should be adopted, incorporating a multidisciplinary framework, including ecology and ecotoxicology, and integrating methods that address the diverse needs of insects across their entire lifecycle, ensuring the identification of essential habitat resources at each stage of development. To assess the status and trends of insects and the effectiveness of strategies, proposals should develop and test approaches for long-term monitoring schemes for insects, possibly building on existing national or EU biodiversity monitoring schemes and pilots developed by Biodiversa+;\n• devise, test and promote effective strategies to mitigate the major drivers of insects’ decline. Analyse the ecosystem functions underpinned by insects and undertake qualitative and quantitative valuation of ecosystem services emanating from those functions;\n• explore how to implement ecosystem protection and restoration practises and actions that are beneficial for insects.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, EMBRC, eLTER and MIRRI-ERIC [1] to store and give access to research data could be considered where relevant.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service and with other projects that work on understanding drivers of biodiversity decline.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] And any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).

          "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\n• the knowledge of existing groundwater ecosystems [1] is improved, supporting policymakers and technical experts in assessments of their presence, functions and condition or status, and their role for climate change mitigation;\n• society benefits from enhanced knowledge and awareness of pollution and overexploitation risks to groundwater ecosystems and the ecosystem services provided by them, including of possible implications for other related ecosystems (associated aquatic and dependent terrestrial ecosystems) and for human health as well as for food and water security, disaster risk reduction and resilience building;\n• the EU water polices are supported with new scientific evidence and public authorities are better equipped for setting effective measures for the protection of groundwater biodiversity and their possible links to groundwater-dependent ecosystems.",
          "scope": "The European Environment Agency (EEA)’s report on Europe's state of water (2024) [2] highlighted that 77% of groundwater, which supplies two thirds of the EU's drinking water, is in good chemical status. For groundwater not reaching good chemical status, the report identified nitrates, pesticides and pharmaceuticals among main issues. However, less is known about contaminants of emerging concern, such as perfluorinated substances (e.g. PFAS), microplastics and antimicrobial resistance. The Commission proposal [3] to revise the lists of surface- and groundwater pollutants and their standards in the Water Framework Directive, in the Groundwater Directive and in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive aims to address these concerns. Although freshwater standards can serve as a benchmark, standards that are protective for freshwater ecosystems may not be sufficiently protective for groundwater ecosystems. [4] Much stronger evidence on presence, functions and sensitivity of groundwater ecosystems is required for a reliable hazard assessment.\nSignificant knowledge gaps exist regarding groundwater ecosystems and their biodiversity in Europe, making it challenging to establish their effective protection. Proposals should address such gaps, which would ultimately lead to better protection of our precious drinking water resources, as well as groundwater biodiversity and geodiversity, but also groundwater (aquatic and terrestrial)-dependent ecosystems and biodiversity.\nMore specifically proposals under this topic should include all of the following activities:\n• improve and develop innovative methods, including by utilising sensors (e.g. biosensors, remote sensors), for assessing and characterising groundwater ecosystems and their sensitivity, and identifying the presence and functions of different taxonomic groups and organisms;\n• establish harmonised, validated, and ultimately standardised, methods and generate reliable experimental data on acute and chronic effects for assessing ecotoxicity of pollutants as regards groundwater ecosystems and in particular sensitive/ vulnerable ecosystems, with the aim to prioritize substances and deriving groundwater standards to protect them;\n• identify a suite of biological and physico-chemical quality elements in view of a possible future assessment and classification of groundwater ecological status for inclusion in EU water legislation. This should include developing criteria and targets related to the temporary or long-term impacts on groundwater ecosystems.\nWhere relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing EU-funded projects and initiatives, for example projects funded by the co-funded partnership “Water4All”, with focus on groundwaters, to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid duplication.\nProposals are encouraged to combine inter-disciplinary expertise and integrate perspectives from different governance levels.\nConcrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, eLTER and MIRRI-ERIC (and any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) [5] ) to store and give access to research data could be considered where relevant.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. The research actions are expected to yield valuable new insights and data, supporting and informing future assessments by IPBES.\nThe JRC can provide estimates of groundwater recharge and contribution of groundwater to streamflow, based on continental scale hydrological modelling, and consider testing the methods developed in the project, for the purposes of continental scale assessment of groundwater-dependent ecosystems.\nInternational cooperation with Mediterranean countries is encouraged.\n[1] Groundwater ecosystems, in a broad sense, encompass systems formed by organisms inhabiting water-filled spaces in the subsurface, including sediments and rocks, the hyporheic zone beneath rivers, the interfaces at springs and lakes, and the zone from the groundwater table surface down to the deepest habitable conditions, such as cave waters. These ecosystems are open systems that maintain direct connections with other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n[2] https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/europes-state-of-water-2024\n[3] https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-amending-water-directives_en\n[4] See for example EMA (European Medicines Agency, 2018).

          "scope": "The deep sea represents 90% of the Ocean volume and remains the least explored biome of the planet. Nevertheless, we know that the deep sea forms an extensive and complex ensemble of ecosystems which functioning is crucial to the rest of the biosphere, global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems upon which much terrestrial life, including human civilisation, depends. The critical limiting factors in the definition and implementation of protection and restoration measures are the lack of biodiversity knowledge and appropriate monitoring, especially in layers below 1000 m. The main reasons are the limited access and high cost of explorations of the diversity of biotopes in the deep sea, and the resources available to identify organisms across the full range of sizes (from microorganisms to megafauna) and describe ecosystems functioning.\nIn line with the objectives and targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU climate adaptation strategy, the strategy for European life sciences, the European Ocean Pact, the Treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), proposals should:\n• fill the gaps in geographical coverage in habitats mapping, species inventory, genetic diversity, ecological functioning, food webs and ecological connectivity (including migratory species) of deep sea ecosystems in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones (abyssal seafloor, hydrothermal sites, seamounts, canyons and across the water column) between them and with shallower ocean zones (mesopelagic, epipelagic, coastal...);\n• develop, integrate and deploy imaging, acoustic, multi-omics, genomics and taxonomic technologies and methodologies for the inventory and fast identification of deep-sea marine species from microbes, invertebrates to migratory species, apex predators such as sharks and mammals, corals and other habitat-forming species, generating reference datasets from identified voucher specimens and novel methods to improve biodiversity monitoring and inventory and the discovery of novel biological traits, enhancing understanding of ecosystem resilience to climate and anthropogenic pressures;\n• contribute to the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and to free and open access to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s biodiversity data;\n• establish baselines, spatial and temporal dynamics, assess and predict the cumulated impacts from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors including underwater noise, on ecosystems functioning and services, including the biological carbon pump fisheries stock;\n• describe holistic interactions between the deep sea, Ocean and planetary health and propose actionable knowledge by involving multiple stakeholders for identifying adaptive management approaches, and mitigation and conservation scenarios for prioritised deep sea areas to reduce impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on ecosystem structure and functioning;\n• identify the indicators and thresholds, such as Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) and propose cost-effective observation approaches and the data integration, for the long-term monitoring and the modelling of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems functioning, covering oxygen concentration, carbon fluxes, nutrients and biogeochemistry, to inform management on impacts and conservation or mitigation measures.\nProposals should foresee dedicated tasks and resources for cooperating with projects funded under this topic as well as with other relevant international, Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 projects on marine biodiversity, functional ecology and on observation, mapping, monitoring and modelling. Proposals should also foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.

However, the intensification of the main drivers of biodiversity loss is raising questions on how their effectiveness will be maintained in the future.\nThis topic is expected to support the EU commitment to legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s land area and a minimum of 30% of the EU’s sea area of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (target 1) and the related legislation, and the corresponding target of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (target 3). Knowledge generated under this topic is also expected to inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy after 2030 and the design and implementation of climate policies. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate provide recommendations to policy makers.\nProposals should:\n• analyse trends over time of the effects of drivers of biodiversity loss and their possible cumulative impacts. Direct drivers (changing use of sea and land, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species) and indirect drivers should be considered, including socio-economic related ones;\n• develop predictive tools to anticipate how the intensity of impacts will develop in the medium and long terms, taking into account relevant possible cumulative impacts;\n• assess expected future impacts on the conservation status of protected habitats and species in protected areas;\n• assess whether novel adaptive approaches for protection are needed and if so, explore options, possibly building on results of relevant LIFE projects and on the experience of climate refugia (areas where ecosystems sustain stability and resilience despite climate change) and of bright spots (where targeted conservation actions, climate adaptation strategies, or natural resilience mechanisms mitigate biodiversity loss). Assess the opportunity to rely on (new) practices such as assisted migration;\n• define best practices and test innovative management approaches of protected areas, with performance indicators. To assess the effectiveness of management approaches, projects should build on methods and indicators developed under LIFE PAME Europe [1] . Proposals should address various types of protected areas and assess how the results might be transposable;\n• consider the need for long-term ecological monitoring of protected habitats and species, provide recommendations and consider possible options for such long-term monitoring;\n• involve public authorities and/or entities which manage protected areas, and civil society organisations to ensure that the processes and outcomes of the R&I align with the needs, including for policy implementation, and values and expectations of society.\nProposals should address research field A: terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems or research field B: marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Both research fields may include freshwater ecosystems. The research field (A or B) should be clearly indicated on the application.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service, and ensure cooperation with the European partnership Biodiversa+.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] in the environment domain.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged especially when protected areas expand over different countries and for exchange of experiences.\n[1] LIFE PAME EUROPE - EUROPARC Federation\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

          "scope": "To address the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), as well as Sustainable Development Goals, actions funded under this topic should support the scientific development of A) integrated scenarios, B) predictive models and C) model intercomparison experiments for Member States and Associated Countries. Developments should be verified in case studies covering at least 2 European biogeographic regions [1] and spanning key economic sectors to inform systemic policy transformations and enable long-term planning for a nature positive society. Proposals should:\n• design and develop components of a European integrated prediction and scenario framework to forecast how natural ecosystems respond to a wide range of human-induced ecosystem interactions including climate change, pollution, socio-economic transitions such as conflicts, pressures, and policy interventions. These frameworks should link ecosystem functions with key economic sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, and test their resilience and tipping points under multiple plausible futures;\n• make use of long-term monitoring data across biodiversity, land use, climate, and socio-economic variables to improve reliability and real-world relevance. They should also quantify uncertainty in model projections and ensure scenarios incorporate dynamic feedback loops between ecosystems and socio-economic systems, and identify risk distributions relevant to frontline socio-ecological communities;\n• test and assess the suitability of the IPBES Nature Futures Framework for European application and align modelling approaches with international efforts and assessments under IPBES and IPCC. Proposals should seek to address knowledge gaps identified by the relevant IPBES assessments and if appropriate provide recommendations to policymakers;\n• advance model intercomparison capabilities to improve robustness, consistency and transparency in scenario-based assessments. To this end, the suitability of remote sensing data for scalability and intercomparison between different models and across different regions should be assessed.\nProposals should include case studies that cover at least two European biogeographic regions with global relevance to verify the developed scenarios, models and intercomparison experiments. Case studies should consider different geographical scales and explore ecosystem tele coupling across Europe and beyond. Scenario development should involve relevant stakeholders—including public authorities, economic sectors, and civil society—in co-creating narratives and ensuring policy applicability. Socio-economic transitions and equity and justice considerations concerning trade-offs and distributional impacts across regions and communities (i.e. across biodiversity, climate, food, water, air, health, energy and the economy) should be explicitly addressed in scenario assessments. Proposals are encouraged to address livelihood and distributional impacts linked to each nature-positive pathway. Proposals are encouraged to broadly and publicly communicate developed scenarios through interactive simulation interfaces (i.e. at the example of EN-ROADS [2] ).\nProposals should create synergies with and build on existing knowledge and results of other relevant EU-funded projects. Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures. This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science (ESSI). Successful proposals are expected to cooperate with projects that will be selected under ESA's FutureEO programme. To this end, proposals should foresee sufficient means and resources for effective coordination.\n[1] Biogeographical regions in Europe | European Environment Agency's home page\n[2] https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/",

          "scope": "Genetic erosion poses a significant threat to agricultural resilience, as genetic diversity is crucial for crops to withstand environmental stresses such as climate variations, pests, and diseases. As the global population grows, the demand for increased food production often drives large-scale agriculture, which compromises biodiversity and long-term productivity. While promoting and expanding agrobiodiversity enhances agricultural resilience, socio-economic obstacles hinder broader adoption. Beyond highlighting the importance of conserving agricultural biodiversity for food security, it is essential to demonstrate its role in enhancing food production, increasing farmers' incomes, and safeguarding livelihoods against environmental challenges. A significant obstacle to a wider adoption of more diversified production systems, is perceived risk in that process, in terms of yield, (marginal) income, lack of demand, stable and sufficient pricing, and potential increase of pests.\nProposals should:\n• quantify the contribution of agrobiodiversity (including soil microorganisms), mainly at parcel/farm level, considering both species abundance and composition, and its economic impact, in particular in regard to food security, such as yield stability, nutritional quality, nutrient cycling and resilience to pests and diseases;\n• develop solutions and strategies to scale successful agrobiodiversity practices tailored to local, regional and national levels to strengthen farmers’ financial position in adopting more diversified production systems;\n• test how instruments for mobilising private finance, such as nature credits, could enhance the competitiveness of farmers, foresters and other land managers, including by opening up new opportunities of income;\n• build on and develop a decision support tool analysing the risk of diversifying production systems, in terms of yield, marketability, pricing, pests and diseases, hazard assessment of adverse organisms, genes and chemicals, and more, to assist farmers, breeders and agribusinesses in farm diversification;\n• provide recommendation for farmers, breeders, agricultural organizations, and agribusinesses for risk mitigation in adoption of wider varieties and marketability of non-conventional crops and local breeds produced in lower volumes ;\n• define and evaluate the costs of farm diversification, in terms of labour and management complexity, and explore how these may be offset via lower costs of external inputs. Identify behavioural determinants in different socio-economic and cultural contexts to adoption of biodiversity friendly practices;\n• explore pathways for the valorisation of products, including tailored food processing and storage, relevant risk assessments for new methods/varieties, and strengthened collaboration with food industries.\nThe projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] , the Nature Credits Roadmap [2] , and the EU Nature Restoration Regulation.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding to assess the inclusion of quantified data in the EU Food System Monitoring Dashboard, and farm sector resilience analysis. Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service.\nProposals must adopt a multi-actor approach, engaging diverse stakeholders, particularly farmers and land managers, to integrate sector-specific knowledge and needs. This ensures impactful outcomes that address conservation and habitat requirements while aligning with agricultural contexts.\nProposals should build (when relevant) upon existing knowledge and solutions designed and previously developed from previous projects demonstrating positive outcomes of enhancing agrobiodiversity for sustainable agriculture, funded by EU and national programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), and the LIFE programme. Proposals should plan cooperation with the Agroecology Partnership and the Mission Soil.\nDue to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, including with China under the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biosolutions (FAB) flagship initiative. Development of specific technologies above TRL 4 is out of the scope of this topic.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex",

          "scope": "The topic aims at improved management of the end-of-life phase of textile products. Textiles are the fourth highest-pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water and fifth for GHG emissions and a major source of microplastic pollution in production and use phases. They are also a key material and product stream in the circular economy action plan. Proposals are expected to demonstrate and deploy innovative solutions for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary textile materials and their processing and treatments.\nProposals should:\n• address textile consumer products made of fibre blends (e.g. polycotton, or other blends of multiple materials in combination such as synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural);\n• demonstrate and test novel and marketable solutions for post-consumer textile waste (apparel and home textiles) enabling its effective end-of-life collection, sorting and recycling (fibre-to-fibre), possibly including biotech solutions;\n• demonstrate and test innovative techniques for effectively disassembling complex products, separating multi-material layers and fibre blends and removal of non-textile components, coatings or contaminants to facilitate efficient recycling processes;\n• assess the recyclability limits of textiles by determining the number of recycling cycles a fibre can undergo. When further fibre-to-fibre recycling is no longer viable, alternative applications should be explored to extend the material's value. Solutions should address recycling of products made of natural fibres (e.g., cotton) or/and semi-synthetic fibres, i.e. modified natural fibres (e.g. viscose), blended with synthetic fibres, ensuring optimal resource efficiency and minimizing waste throughout the textile lifecycle;\n• characterize post-consumer textile waste in order to define appropriate management practices in particular if the technology is developed within an industrial and urban symbiosis;\n• advance recycling technologies that remove persistent chemicals (e.g. PFAS) from post-consumer textile waste which may harm human health and the environment, and that minimise the release of hazardous chemicals and microplastics during the recycling process.\nA lifecycle perspective using LCA and LCC should be used when validating the technical and economic feasibility of the developed, improved, demonstrated and up-scaled processes. For comparability reasons, LCAs should use well-established methods and be based on PEF wherever feasible. Proposals should fully incorporate the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) approach.\nProposals are expected to contribute to the objectives of the Textiles of the Future partnership and to build on/coordinate with EU projects funded under the partnership and previous textile-related Horizon Europe calls. Clustering with other relevant Horizon Europe projects is encouraged.\nThe topic supports the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles, the Waste Framework Directive, the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the upcoming Circular Economy Act and contributes to Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products. It also contributes to the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy.",

          "expected_outcome": "Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\n• enhanced understanding of the environmental, social and economic potential of the supply of different biomass types (from local to international perspectives), as well as its sustainability implications, including biodiversity and (air, water and soil) pollution, synergies and tensions;\n• enhanced capacity of private and public stakeholders to increase resource efficiency in utilising primary and secondary biomass as well as biomass processing and use, including through digital tools which may involve artificial intelligence and remote sensing, and roadmaps towards sustainable biomass management; without undermining food security;\n• enhanced support to businesses and administrations that optimise biomass supply, processing, and use, such that ecosystems and biodiversity are protected and restored, emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants reduced, and human needs for biomass satisfied in sufficient and fair way.",
          "scope": "There is a need to better understand the production and use of biomass, a limited resource, in its various types. Bioeconomy, and biomass as its essential feedstock, provides solutions on various dimensions (environmental, social and economic). However, there are biomass-related challenges to overcome: the EU forest carbon sink is below the target and declining in most countries and the need to restore ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss [1] . This implies that biomass supply is partly unsustainable. Simultaneously, companies see themselves challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are solutions to increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the demand: e.g. better valorise unused or under-exploited sustainable biomass and degraded land, apply new breeding techniques and increase resource efficiency through circular design, new business models, consumption, recycling or repair.\nThere is a need to better understand where biomass valorisation can be improved, to ensure local or regional added value increases and to drive innovative and competitive business solutions. For an optimal biomass production and effective use, matching supply and demand in the local or regional context, a better and more robust understanding of actual biomass flows is a fundamental prerequisite.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n• Improve and develop innovative, administration-light biomass monitoring and modelling/assessment methods and digital tools at European level (regional, national, and continental scale) to optimise biomass flows, paying particular attention to areas with untapped (sustainable) biomass resources, in close cooperation with stakeholders.\n• Provide an updated estimate of biomass supply and demand today and projected until 2050 at national and EU level, including associated countries, considering the quality of biomass, their potential use, the sustainability and risks (e.g. spread of pathogens) of supplied biomass, as well as potential non-satisfied (non-)industrial demand due to the limitation of availability of sustainable biomass. The 2050 outlook should be accompanied by scenarios on EU’s future bioresources regarding supply and demand.\n• Test and demonstrate, in cooperation with stakeholders, the feasibility of biomass reporting in test regions of at least 10 countries across Europe with different potential of biomass supply.\nThe European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding since the monitoring and assessment tools developed may contribute to the EU level assessment of biomass flows of the Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy.\nProposals are encouraged to work together with additional relevant initiatives including those of the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, the BIOEAST Initiative; build on results from projects such as BIO2REG, CONCERTO, NextGenCarbon; as well as considering the topic ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-08: Improving biomass flows for a sustainable and circular bioeconomy’.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by the European research infrastructure in the environment, biological and food domains.\nThe topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the European Commission’s communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU; the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal; the Vision for Agriculture and Food; the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act and the Circular Economy Act.\n[1] EEA The European Biomass Puzzle | European Environment Agency's home page / EC LULUCF report / EC JRC The JRC Biomass Mandate | Knowledge for policy .",

          "scope": "As the bioeconomy and nature markets gain importance, enabling diversification of value streams for farmers, policymakers must ensure that the growing use of agricultural biomass and agricultural land for non-food purposes (e.g., for the development of novel bio-based chemicals, compounds, materials, products and services, energy production, environmental services provision, carbon and biodiversity credits) does not compromise food security. For the purpose of this topic, nature markets encompass market mechanisms (e.g., nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap [1] , carbon credits, market-based payments for environmental services) mobilising private finance to create income streams for primary producers in return for undertaking actions supporting well-functioning ecosystem services (e.g., water quality and availability, biodiversity, climate). Strategies are needed to balance market incentives, safeguard food supply and the environment, and support farmers in diversifying incomes through sustainable business models and value chains. Successful proposals should support the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Common Agricultural Policy, the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) Regulation and the climate and biodiversity objectives of the European Green Deal.\nProposals should:\n• explore natural capital accounting methods integrating economics and nature into agricultural accounts, and their potential to support economic valuation, pricing and integration in decision-making of environmental services provided by farmers;\n• analyse existing and develop new innovative business models and value chains from which farmers can derive fair value and new income beyond food and feed production. This work should include, among others, an assessment of their potential to integrate sustainable practices, enhance farm profitability and performance, and support the transition to a circular bio-based economy and the green transition, as well as an assessment of the market operators involved;\n• when conducting the research/assessment, consider the potential of biomass residues and secondary biomass streams, including waste, as well as low value, unused or underutilised biomass, and land areas;\n• conduct interdisciplinary research from farm to macro levels, encompassing economic, social, biodiversity and climate impacts, and provide analytical tools in particular assessing implications for: farmers' income, decision-making and farm management including of its natural capital ; biomass supply and demand and threshold effects of market prices on production choices; land-use conflicts and food security risks (covering the availability, accessibility, utilisation and stability dimensions), considering leakage effects and other potential conflicts of use (e.g. water);\n• provide recommendations for the design of policies and sustainable business models and value chains. The recommendations should anticipate trade-offs and align bioeconomy, climate and biodiversity goals while safeguarding food security and ensuring that farmers can diversify and receive fair incomes. They should also respond to evolving consumer demand.\nProposals should ensure complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. Proposals should also ensure synergies with other relevant EU-funded LIFE and knowledge innovation projects, studies, pilot projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., Economic Accounts for Agriculture framework).\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities).\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, farm accountants, and businesses.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] in the environment, biological & food domains.\n[1] EUR-Lex - 52025DC0374 - EN - EUR-Lex\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

          "scope": "The European industry must transition to a greener, more sustainable model to enhance its competitiveness against other business models and foster the production of novel high-value sustainable products. Achieving this requires a shift towards a bio-based system, which leverages biological processes to deliver products that contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing environmental impact and can compete with and eventually replace traditional models. For instance, the current use of hazardous chemicals in various industries, such as the textile and polymer industries, requires the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives.\nIn this context, the vast and largely untapped diversity of marine organisms—including fungi, algae, and invertebrates—presents a valuable source of biomolecules with unique properties. These marine-derived compounds hold significant potential across a range of applications, for example from construction materials, chemical processes to bioplastics and textiles. Supporting research and innovation in blue biotechnology fosters the transition toward greener, high-performance products across multiple industries.\nProposals should address the following:\n• develop safe and sustainable blue bio-based products, by exploring the use of the unique physical, chemical and biochemical properties of biomolecules from marine organisms (e.g., adhesion, structural organization, fluorescence, luminescence). Proposals in scope include novel adhesion agents or bonding products, biochemicals to replace hazardous chemicals, antifouling paintings and coatings, replacement for synthetic surfactants, biomarkers, biosensors, enzymes. Proposals aiming to develop molecules with important economic or societal impact are encouraged. The applications in health biotechnology, as well as the biofuel/bioenergy area are excluded, to avoid overlaps with Horizon Europe Clusters 1 and 5, respectively;\n• incorporate the use of synthetic and engineering biology approaches and foresee the necessary links with the digital technologies and tools (AI/ML, bioinformatics);\n• include the assessment of the costs and benefits compared to conventional alternatives in the market. Proposals should look into regulatory, market and value chain bottlenecks;\n• assess the safety, environmental sustainability and effectiveness of the developed bio-based products derived from marine environments compared to the equivalent material on the market;\n• develop recommendations for policy makers and industrial actors, considering the available scientifically sound assessment of risks and benefits of the developed solutions.\nProposals should cover the innovation chain from research, to development, and proof of concept. Legal aspects linked to securing clear access to marine resources, including related infrastructures and bio-resources banks and collections, their sustainable use as well as access and benefit sharing aspects, should be properly considered. Marine resources can be obtained sustainably from natural environments, as well as from publicly or privately accessible collections. The harvesting or utilization of sentient marine animals, including invertebrates, must be carefully evaluated to ensure that ethical and moral considerations are adequately addressed.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] , such as EMSO ERIC, EU-OPENSCREEN, ELIXIR, EMBRC ERIC, IBISBA. Efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of all relevant stakeholders to maximize the impact and use of the developed products, including but not limited to economic and financial actors. International cooperation, for example with Latin America and Caribbean countries, is encouraged.\nProposals are expected to establish synergies and links with relevant projects funded under the Horizon Europe CL6 Work Programmes 2021-2025 [2] and with actions supported by the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU) and the Sustainable Blue Partnership (SBEP) ensuring that any potential overlaps or duplications are avoided.\nProjects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the European Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act, the EU Algae Initiative, the European Ocean Pact, the EU strategy on research and technology infrastructures, and the new approach for a sustainable blue economy .\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\n[2] E.g.

          "scope": "The Vision for Agriculture and Food [1] recognises organic farming as an approach with potential to ensure an attractive and predictable agri-food sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive, while at the same time delivering several ecosystem services beneficial for the environment, climate and biodiversity. The Vision also recognises the importance of research and innovation (R&I) for sustainable farming approaches, such as organic farming, to thrive. At the same time, the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production [2] attaches a central role to R&I for achieving the Plan’s objectives. In line with this Action Plan, under Horizon Europe, the EU has funded several R&I projects addressing multiple aspects and challenges of organic production. The purpose of this topic is to fill remaining R&I needs to boost the organic farming sector in Europe.\nProposals should increase knowledge and develop safe, viable and cost-effective innovations to tackle agronomic, sustainability (social, biodiversity, climate, economic), value chain development and/or market-related challenges of organic production. Proposals should develop innovations addressing land-based organic production in a range of pedo-climatic conditions in the EU and Associated Countries. They should demonstrate the contribution of these innovations to facilitating the uptake and implementation of organic production methods by relevant stakeholders, among which farmers. This should include activities to increase networking and knowledge and best practice exchange among farmers (both among organic farmers and with farmers implementing other approaches) and with other relevant actors.\nProposals should establish sites in diverse pedo-climatic conditions to co-create, test, validate and upscale the innovations, and set-up a network connecting these sites.\nBoth crop and livestock production systems under organic production are in scope of this topic. Proposals should convincingly explain how they will fill existing R&I needs in line with the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [3] and the Vision for Agriculture and Food [4] . The projects under this topic are also relevant to the EU policies related to the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as the EU’s biodiversity, zero pollution and climate policies.\nIf proposals relate to some of the activities covered by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (including the CORE Organic ERA-Net), to the Horizon Europe Cluster 6 Work Programmes 2021-2022, 2023-2024 or 2025, to projects funded under the EU Mission Soil [5] , and/or to projects funded under the Horizon Europe Partnerships ‘Agroecology’ [6] , Animal Health and Welfare [7] or FutureFoods [8] , they should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, as well as with other relevant ongoing EU-funded organic farming relevant projects, and with projects funded by the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ or other Horizon Europe Partnerships. Activities falling under the scope of the topics ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-BIODIV-09: Enhancing the competitiveness of organic crop breeding: focus on intercropping adapted varieties’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-04: Improving understanding of the contribution of the organic farming sector to sustainability’ in this Work Programme are out of the scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of farmers and other relevant stakeholders involved in the organic farming agri-food value chain, taking into account a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach. The type and nature of stakeholders involved besides farmers should be determined in function of the specific challenge/area addressed. Sectors with high economic relevance in different pedo-climatic conditions and various biogeographical regions across Europe should be targeted in a representative way.\nBeneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties in order to support value chain actors in co-creating, testing, validating and/or upscaling the developed innovations. Proposals should promote close cooperation among relevant research and innovation actors across the EU and Associated Countries, ultimately leading to a more efficient organic production R&I ecosystem by linking up to existing related EU-wide initiatives, in particular the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’.\nThis topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.\n[1] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/overview-vision-agriculture-food/vision-agriculture-and-food_en\n[2] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[4] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0075\n[5] https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/\n[6] https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/funded-projects\n[7] https://www.eupahw.eu/\n[8] https://www.futurefoodspartnership.eu/",

The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. As a co-funded European Partnership, providing financial support to third parties (FSTP) is a core activity of this action in order to achieve its objectives. Consequently, the EUR 60 000 threshold laid down in Article 207 of Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 does not apply. The maximum amount of FSTP that may be awarded to any single third party is set at EUR 10 million[[However, if the objectives of the action would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult (and duly justified in the proposal) the maximum amount may be higher.\nThe starting date of grants awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the application. Applicants must justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their application. Costs incurred from the starting date of the action may be considered eligible (and will be reflected in the entry into force date of the amendment to the grant agreement).]]. This ceiling is justified by the fact that FSTP is a primary activity of this action, by its expected duration of 7–10 years (exceeding a standard project lifespan), and by the extensive experience gained under predecessor partnerships.\ndescribed in\nAnnex G\nof the Work Programme General Annexes.",

          "scope": "The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European partnership of Agriculture of Data identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nThe consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also been implementing the partnership through a co-funded call launched in year 2024 and a number of internal activities, including research projects, based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01. In this context, the current consortium has unique expertise in relation to the objectives of the partnership, the activities to be implemented in particular through financial support to third parties and internal activities clearly required/envisioned pursuant to the initial proposal/partnership. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.\nThe partnership should seek to include additional partners, in particular from Member States and Associated countries not yet in the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01.\nWhile the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01 and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement. Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of the existing topic and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions.\nThe proposal submitted to this call should align with the partnership’s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda. Through its activities, the partnership should deliver and give rise to ready-to-use tools, solutions and innovations, seek uptake of results by farmers/agricultural producers, advisors, policy-makers, public administrations and all relevant stakeholders, and provide science-based policy advisory activities. The proposal should focus on additional priority activities and when duly justified, on continuation of on-going activities.\nThe partnership should create an “umbrella effect” through taking stock, linking and, assessing Research and Innovation (R&I) initiatives and use cases. It should leverage on nationally funded research activities to create critical mass and synergies across borders and also support defragmentation of the European data landscape. It should also pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to organising and implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties, for which it should factor ample time to run and report on the co-funded projects.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] in the environment, food and digital domains.\nSpecific additional activities to enhance the partnership’s collaborations at international level, should also be described.\n[1] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/ .",

          "scope": "Proposals should:\n• better understand, project and reduce uncertainties linked to the impacts, timing and consequences of an ice-free Arctic. This includes the underlying systems (such as ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere) and processes, strengthening research on key or main drivers of internal variability and their interconnectedness to the climate system, under multi and cumulative and cascading impacts of anthropogenic activities (resource extraction, climate change, shipping and industrial activities, pollution, introduction of NIS, etc.), abrupt, irreversible change/tipping elements and thresholds, including their reversibility. In particular, understanding the nuances of the impacts of occasional daily ice-free conditions, versus frequent monthly ice-free conditions, versus ice-free conditions that occur for several months a year, is needed to assess the true impact of a new seasonal Arctic sea ice regime in a warming world, in particular in and for Europe.\n• enhance regional models representing integrated key physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes, especially to capture processes in the changing sea-ice regimes (ecological and political) and the impacts of extremes, building on and further developing the existing IPCC class climate models and making use of new technologies for sustained monitoring of key climate indicators / shared Arctic variables and machine learning techniques for the advanced interpretation of these data.\n• identify transformative pathways and key leverage points for sustainable mitigation and anticipatory adaptation approaches. This could include and are not limited to looking into aspects of: community resilience and health, particularly Indigenous populations, in adapting to cultural, political, economic and environmental changes, including addressing food security, health impacts, and preserving cultural practices; explore novel economic opportunities and challenges, evaluating the potential for shorter and new shipping routes and other economic opportunities, explore sustainable energy solutions for Arctic communities, including wind, solar, and geothermal energy potential, resource exploration, and sustainable economic development while ensuring environmental protection; explore elements of risk management and hazard mitigation preparing for increased coastal erosion, increased extreme weather events, and the impacts of thawing permafrost on infrastructures, greenhouse emissions, and increased risks of natural and anthropogenic hazards; develop strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sequestration in Arctic ecosystems (bearing in mind the precautionary principle/approach, and the efficiency and effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions); improve projections for Arctic’s “Last Ice Area” (LIA) — a vital habitat for ice-dependent species — and critical for Arctic habitats , and inform conservation policies and measures; explore the power of enhancing cooperation among Arctic nations and global partners to share data, resources, and expertise and identify issues of geopolitical and strategic nature and assess the implications of a navigable Arctic for shipping and other blue economy or coastal-linked activities, resource extraction, and international relations, strongly considering sustainability and the precautionary principle/approach.\nActions should conduct trans- and multi-disciplinary research, include aspects of gender, SSH, equality and inclusion, and intergenerational concerns, and strengthen the inclusion of different knowledge systems (Indigenous Knowledge, Local Knowledge and Science) in broadening our understanding the multifaceted governance, sustainable development and international politics of an ice-free Arctic. International cooperation is strongly encouraged, especially with the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) partner countries [1] . A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under Polhavet 2050 – Arctic Ocean 2050. The actions should build on existing observing platforms and initiatives, and/or contribute to the evolution of the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and Destination Earth. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus and EMODnet). Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nThis topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination, with relevant ESA Polar Science Cluster projects, including utilising novel satellite Earth Observation datasets and joint research actions. Furthermore, this topic is supporting the European polar science coordination efforts, including synergies with the objectives of the European Polar Coordination Office (EPCO) and through contributing to the implementation of its work plan. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] , as well as related projects in the environment domain.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The JRC may contribute with its expertise related to developing new methods to forecast air pollution and to estimate methane emissions from thawing permafrost.\n[1] Home - All Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/",

Against this background, proposals should target several systemic risks and crises (e.g., sanitary, environmental, economic, geopolitical, biodiversity, demographic, technological) that are causing, or likely to cause, significant socio-economic impacts directly or indirectly affecting European agriculture or forestry, and agri-food or forest-based supply chains, considering potential compound, cascading and amplifier effects under climate change.\nThe actions under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU Forest Strategy, the common agricultural policy, and the forthcoming European Climate Adaptation Plan.\nProposals should:\n• improve analytical capacity on: the exposure of the agricultural or forestry sectors and of agri-food or forest-based supply chains and their agents, including consumers, to (interacting) systemic risks and crises, including compound, cascading and amplifier effects related to climate change and trade disruptions; the assessment and measurement of the propagation of shocks and short-, medium- and long-term impacts (social, economic, environmental including biodiversity) of those (interacting) systemic risks and crises on the agricultural or forestry sectors and on agri-food or forest-based supply chains and their agents, at different scales (local to global) and considering the vulnerability of different groups (e.g. age, gender or other social factors). Proposals should take into account the specificities of different types of supply chains, e.g., in terms of length, organisation, critical dependencies, considering also the role of ecosystem services and, where relevant, intergenerational time scales;\n• explore a range of effective socio-economic and technological (e.g., advanced digital technologies) options and identify leverage points to further develop integrated prevention, preparedness, management, adaptation and transformation strategies and pathways that encompass different temporal (short to long term) and spatial (global to local) scales to improve the resilience at each critical stage of the agri-food or forest-based supply chains;\n• analyse those options with regard to societal and institutional preconditions, the costs and benefits, at different levels, of action versus non-action, as well as coherence, synergies and trade-offs with competitiveness, health and sustainability objectives.\nProposals should either address Area A: Agriculture and agri-food supply chains, or Area B: Forestry and forest-based supply chains. The area (A or B) should be clearly indicated in the application.\nProposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. They should also ensure complementarities with other relevant EU-funded projects, including from the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Soil, and ensure synergies with other relevant EU initiatives and processes (e.g., Resilience Dashboards [2] ).\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.). Proposals selected in Area A are also expected to collaborate with the projects selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-03-GOVERNANCE-01: Strengthening the resilience of European farmers through improved capacity in coping with risks and crises.\nProposals should support collaborative and interdisciplinary work, involving the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines in combination with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [3] in the environmental, biological and food domains.\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding.

By establishing EU quality criteria and laying down monitoring and reporting processes, the CRCF Regulation will facilitate investment in innovative carbon removal technologies, as well as sustainable carbon farming solutions, while addressing greenwashing. By 2026, the Commission will have adopted the first EU certification methodologies for different carbon farming activities through delegated acts, will have issued implementing acts with certification rules, and will have started the process of recognising certification schemes entitled to apply CRCF rules. With implementation of CRCF expected to start in 2027, this topic should serve to develop innovations and knowledge facilitating and enhancing its implementation on the ground.\nProposals should:\n• develop innovations to facilitate carbon farming certification, particularly by integrating advanced technologies (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, Earth observation, IoT) and by enhancing cooperation among holders of relevant knowledge and data (e.g., networks of benchmark sites, ring tests among soil laboratories, interoperability of relevant datasets), in order to harmonise data collection and verification and to minimise administrative burden for operators;\n• maintain open-access lists of models, sampling protocols, datasets of emission factors and other relevant data to harmonise sustainability benchmarks for carbon farming activities, enhance the robustness of company-level and national greenhouse gas inventories for the land sector and the agricultural sector, and ensure the comparability and interoperability of all CRCF uses;\n• based on experience with the implementation of the CRCF Regulation and its implementing rules during the first years after entry into force, and building on previous knowledge and tools developed by other relevant (EU-funded) projects, enhance capacity among the relevant stakeholders and facilitate the broad application of new or improved technologies, processes or services supporting the successful participation of land managers, certification schemes, and certification bodies;\n• create awareness about CRCF among all potential users, buyers, or financiers of carbon farming (e.g., companies in the bioeconomy, national and regional agriculture and environmental authorities, financial institutions), collect information about their data needs, and facilitate access to those data within the context of CRCF certification and registry;\n• systematically collect and analyse feedback and lessons learned by carbon farming actors involved in CRCF implementation, particularly regarding obstacles to implementing and scaling-up of CRCF certification;\n• identify and address – through technological, economic or social innovations – remaining obstacles for effective large-scale participation in CRCF certification, and propose potential improvements to enabling conditions, certification methodologies, verification rules, and incentive structures.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of relevant stakeholders, including potential carbon-farming practitioners (farmers, foresters and other land managers), other market participants, certification bodies and relevant public authorities.\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project(s) selected under this topic and with projects under other relevant topics in Horizon Europe Work Programmes, including the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' and the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO).\nIn this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.\n[1] https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en#eu-carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming-certification-crcf-regulation",

Better understand the distribution, underlying mechanisms and impacts of changes in the Southern Ocean and sea ice to reduce uncertainties in projected future changes of large-scale ocean circulation and transport, including abrupt, irreversible change/tipping elements and thresholds, collapse of the overturning circulations, regional and global climate and weather systems. This should include extreme events and mid-latitude weather; fluxes between the ice sheet and the ocean; the future dynamics of oceanic carbon pools;\n• explore the vulnerability of Southern Ocean ecosystems, including the impacts of climate change, pollution and other anthropogenic activities on marine biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics changes in the near (∼2030), mid (2050–2060) and long-term (after ∼2060). This includes improved control variables for the diversity of all life forms incorporating also the microbiome and functions (functional diversity), as well as the biocomplexity suitable for measuring biosphere integrity in different facets. Proposals should also contribute to the development or strengthening of long-term, continuous monitoring systems for Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, in synergy with existing observation infrastructures;\n• develop mechanisms to distinguish human-induced environmental changes from natural ones and develop strategies to protect the fragile environment of the Southern Ocean from human activities and climate change, as well as comprehensively establish the efficacy of Southern Ocean conservation measures for preserving evolutionary potential and those properties that best anticipate change;\n• further improve key ocean, cryosphere, climate and biodiversity monitoring indicators that support international, regional and global assessments and foster the development of a regional approach to polar ocean and climate observations, monitoring and reporting, and further the representation of multi-scale interactions in Earth System Models (ESMs) and regional coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea ice–land models representing key physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes in the polar ocean regions;\n• advance capabilities to provide evidence, tractable proposals and recommendations for commensurate policy and protection, restoration and long-term sustainable management responses to prevent the Southern Ocean and its ecosystems and cryosphere from reaching a point of no return.\nThe actions should contribute to the evolution of the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and Destination Earth, and interface with the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this topic should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, and EMODnet). Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [1] , as well as related projects in the environment domain, such as POLARIN [2] . International cooperation is strongly encouraged, especially with All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) partner countries [3] . This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination, with relevant ESA Polar Science Cluster projects, including utilising novel satellite Earth Observation datasets and joint research actions.

Enteric fermentation in ruminants produces substantial methane emissions, while inefficient feed conversion increases feed demand, land use, and pollution. Developing and implementing effective feed additives can lower methane production, enhance nutrient utilization, and reduce nitrogen excretion, supporting sustainable livestock farming, improved profitability for farmers, and global climate goals.\nReducing methane emissions from ruminants contributes to environmental sustainability by lowering the climate and environmental impact of livestock production, while also supporting economic sustainability for farmers through improved productivity and cost savings. Only a handful of additives have demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing methane emissions or have become commercially available. The limited availability of reliable options and the challenges posed by inconsistent efficacy and applicability across diverse production systems represent a constraint. Proposals should address various terrestrial livestock systems, from conventional to extensive systems, considering regional feeding systems. Proposals should address at least farmed large ruminants.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n• develop and test a wide range of additives that reduce emissions in operational environment (reaching TRL 7), their synergies and optimal delivery strategies for diverse terrestrial livestock systems, including extensive and grass-based systems, both under conventional and organic production. Impacts on animal health, welfare, performance, product quality, and net GHG emissions and air pollutants, and potential trade-offs among these factors should be addressed;\n• identify clear endpoints for risk assessment of feed additives to demonstrate their safety and define complementarity criteria to demonstrate their effectiveness and environmental impact, all supported by scientific evidence;\n• verify the practicalities, applicability, scalability and socio-economic-environmental impacts, including trade-offs with other environmental and social dimensions, of using feed additives across different production systems and in different feeding scenarios;\n• promote and facilitate a standardised data collection system for quality control procedures and record-keeping practices that ensures consistency across stakeholder groups and meets the requirements for accurate reporting, keeping in mind the EU [2] and EFSA regulatory framework from the inception and for feed additives;\n• identify strategies like improved distribution networks, farmer education programmes, and possible subsidies or incentives to make new innovative feed additives that reduce livestock emissions more affordable;\n• assessing consumer perception to understand attitudes towards the use of feed additives to reduce emissions in livestock production and identify key factors influencing their decisions.\nThe JRC participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the integrated agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP), sharing information, and contributing to dissemination of results.\nTo respect the ‘Do-No-Significant-Harm' (DNSH) principle, proposals need to properly address and exclude any potential risk of feed additives on the environment, animal or human health.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in the livestock sectors, including farmers, advisors, private sector/industry (e.g., processors, feed manufacturers), policy-makers, consumers, etc.\nProposals should capitalise on research findings and tools, included those developed under previous and ongoing relevant research projects. Proposals should interact with relevant structures or organizations at European level and beyond such as FAO, Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP, FAO) [3] , Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases [4] .\nTo better address the requirements of the topic, international cooperation is encouraged.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] Regulation (EC) 1831/2003 , Regulation (EC) 767/2009\n[3] https://www.fao.org/partnerships/leap/en/\n[4] https://globalresearchalliance.org/research/livestock/networks/",

          "scope": "The Vision for Agriculture and Food recognises organic farming as an approach with potential to ensure an attractive and predictable agri-food sector, while at the same time delivering several ecosystem services beneficial for the environment, climate and biodiversity. There is a dual need to, on one hand, better understand the contribution of organic farming and of the organic sector as a whole to the three dimensions of sustainability, and on the other, to improve methods for data collection in the organic sector, in a way that reduces administrative burden on farmers and on other operators. There is potential for both needs to be addressed in combination, and a role for research and innovation to support in achieving this objective.\nProposals should address all the following activities:\n• undertake an exhaustive mapping of existing tools, platforms and methods at EU, national and local levels, that allow for the collection of relevant data on organic production to comply with the various reporting requirements of the sector, including under the Common Agricultural Policy and under the EU organic certification. This exercise should include a mapping of the actors involved in the collection of data, as well as an analysis of cost-effectiveness, best practices and challenges faced. It should also include an assessment of the potential of existing tools to reduce administrative burden on organic farmers and on other operators of the organic value chain, as well as to streamline data exchange with relevant actors, including certification bodies and supply chain actors;\n• facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices on data collection and reporting on organic production across the EU. Identify concrete opportunities for the cross-fertilisation and transfer of solutions among countries/regions;\n• assess the need, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of leveraging existing data collected by organic certification bodies in a way that it can simultaneously be used to assess the contribution of organic production to the three axes of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). This should include an analysis of existing standards for the interoperability of agricultural digital systems, and identification of opportunities and challenges;\n• develop recommendations, including in relation to governance, for the effective use of current tools for data collection, considering differences across the EU Member States;\n• organise and implement training activities targeted to organic farmers and other operators of the organic value chains, to build their capacities to collect relevant data to comply with the reporting obligations on organic production. This should include networking activities to foster cooperation among actors in the organic agri-food supply chains with a view to increasing overall efficiency of the organic sector for data collection.\nProposals should address all EU Member States. Proposals under this topic should support the implementation of the EU Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production [1] and of the EU regulatory framework for organic farming, and contribute to the objectives of the Vision for Agriculture and Food [2] , the Common Agricultural Policy, and the EU’s biodiversity, zero pollution and climate policies.\nBoth crop and livestock production systems under organic production are in scope of this topic.\nProposals must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in the organic sector, and including a range of actors to ensure that different sources of knowledge and perspectives are brought together. The needs and expertise of all relevant actors, including certification bodies, should be duly considered in the activities. Proposals should capitalise on existing knowledge and tools, such as the Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN) [3] . Proposals should build on the results of relevant past/ongoing EU-funded R&I projects relevant for the organic farming sector, as well as of other relevant related work/studies, and on any relevant activities funded under the Digital Europe Programme. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other relevant ongoing and upcoming EU-funded R&I projects and initiatives, including the Horizon Europe Partnership ‘Agroecology’ and the project that may follow from the topic “HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-02-01: European Partnership of Agriculture of Data”.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0141R%2801%29\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0075\n[3] https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/farm-structures-and-economics/fsdn_en",

          "scope": "Crop diversification supports farmers resilience to external shocks, be it economic, climatic, or market related. By reducing dependency on a single farmed crop, farmers can strengthen their competitiveness in an ever-changing agricultural landscape. The temporal and spatial diversification of crops through e.g. rotation and associations, are drivers for low-input, resource-efficient farming systems that can fulfil the need to produce food, feed, industrial products (e.g. bioenergy, biomaterials, biochemicals) and other ecosystems services. These diversified and low-input farming systems will emerge if clear benefits to farmers and society are demonstrated and if the downstream value chains are properly organized.\nProposals should:\n• develop, test and showcase innovative solutions as well as business and cooperation models with a focus on activities addressing the challenges to support farmers in diversifying their crop production, enhancing profitability, resilience and sustainability;\n• assess the viability and impact of the practical implementation of the proposed innovations on the overall sustainability of farmers activities and businesses (economic, social and environmental). The climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection and restoration potential of the proposed innovations should be analysed;\n• describe an exploitation pathway tailor-made for the developed innovations through the different necessary steps (e.g. market research, regulatory approvals and licensing, IP management etc.) in order to accelerate exploitation of the results;\n• provide support to farmers to transition to crop diversification, addressing the specific challenges of the sector and designing strategies to overcome them. Create diverse practice-oriented dissemination materials, such as audiovisuals, brochures, presentations, that showcase innovations in a creative way, incorporating artistic elements for engaging storytelling.\nActivities must fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach and allow for adequate involvement of SMEs, technology developers, farmers and consumers. The involvement of farmers SMEs is crucial and should be fostered through targeted calls and financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs developing and testing the proposed innovative solutions. Proposals should address various farming systems/approaches, one of which should be organic farming.\nProposals should allocate adequate resources to collaborate with topic projects funded under other topics in this work programme, in particular \"HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-03.

          "scope": "Small-scale aquatic food production includes small-scale fisheries, recreational fisheries and aquaculture farms that are classified as SMEs. In 2021, small-scale fisheries contributed to 49% of employment in EU fisheries. Together with other maritime activities, small-scale fisheries play a vital role in local economies, particularly in the Mediterranean, where over half of the sector is concentrated. Recreational fisheries are non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport. While the marketing or sale of catches from recreational fisheries is prohibited, if properly monitored and managed they can contribute to conservation efforts and support community development. According to the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, the aquaculture sector in the EU consists primarily of small and family-owned enterprises- especially in the case of mollusk farms. However, small-scale actors often face difficulties in developing and adopting innovative technologies.\nSelected proposals should advance knowledge and develop tools, including Nature-based Solutions, for managing and further developing small-scale aquatic food production. They should include, where relevant, both aspects of natural science and technical know-how to improve small-scale aquatic food production as well as issues related to social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. In the frame of SSH, cultural elements such as local traditions related to aquatic food production and consumption could be included. The scope of the topic includes fisheries and aquaculture activities taking place in fresh, brackish and marine waters, such as small-scale fisheries, small-scale mollusk, seaweed and fish farms, recreational fisheries, urban aquaculture and aquaponics.\nSelected proposals should develop innovative methodologies to assess environmental and socio-economic contributions of relevant small-scale actors to the prosperity of local communities within the broader aquatic food system, taking into account a gender sensitive approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations. This could, for example, include diverse data sources (e.g. citizen science, social media) and advance data processing, validation, and interoperability solutions using for example AI, machine learning, and big data analytics to provide actionable insights.\nThe effects of climate change on small-scale aquatic food production should be addressed as well as the potential contribution of small-scale aquatic food production to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, the potential for environmental services provision and of improvements of ecological footprint should be explored. Aquatic animal welfare issues should be considered, where relevant.\nSelected proposals should include from their design throughout their development and implementation relevant stakeholders and end-users and produce outputs that can be readily applicable by them. Special attention should be given to knowledge transfer, training, and capacity-building activities to ensure the practical implementation of research findings and innovations by small-scale actors and policymakers.",

          "scope": "Through food and beverages, the population is exposed to an immense variety of chemicals (as contaminants and as ingredients). The “foodome” is the complete set of compounds present in a food sample at a given time; it includes both endogenous biomolecules (produced through a species' metabolic processes) and exogenous compounds (natural and synthetic substances from production, processing, handling, and packaging). The current knowledge is largely confined to a narrow set of approximately 150 food components catalogued by traditional databases. These components represent only a very small fraction of the total chemical complexity present in foods, while thousands (>100,000) of compounds and contaminants remain largely unquantified and underexplored. Understanding this “nutrient dark matter” would require identifying, cataloguing and quantifying the full spectrum of substances present in our food and present in accessible, AI-ready databases. The need for such information is today a bottleneck to make the nutrition field predictive and data driven, and has the potential to make food processing more efficient in bringing new foods items on the market. Efforts to create such datasets are underway but owing to the quantity of samples (hundreds of thousands of compounds across thousands of foods), such databases often rely on high-throughput experimental methods which do not allow a precise characterisation of the molecules identified.\nProposals should address the following activities:\n• develop and test validated AI algorithms capable of interpreting and annotating high-throughput foodomics data, for instance from untargeted mass-spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance;\n• the AI algorithms should be capable to predict or infer the presence and concentration of compounds based on (incomplete) foodomics data via innovative approaches, for instance by considering phylogenic relationships between species. Moreover, this should help identify analytical methods and potential food safety hazards based on their similarity to known compounds;\n• develop a European research and innovation network between Member States and Associated Countries in food exposome research to support the development, standardization, valorisation and dissemination of the AI results and considering existing initiatives such as the Centre for Excellence in the Periodic Table of Food Initiative from Wageningen University.\nThe multi-actor approach is encouraged. Proposals should include industry in the consortia and academia, startups, SMEs and international initiatives. Collaboration with international partners is encouraged as well as with existing private companies in the EU/Associated countries.",
