            "<p>Leadership in frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum, Photonics and Semiconductors is essential to Europe’s economic security and global competitiveness. Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Current state-of-the-art technologies have already paved the way for more streamlined operations, yet there remains untapped value in e.g. quality improvement, definition of optimal process operating conditions, reduction of scrap, optimization of energy usage. Real-time monitoring and adaptive optimisation using AI models can enable agile responses to production variability and support sustained, high-performance operations.</p><p>New solutions based on innovative enabling technologies such as deep learning, large language models, digital twins, synthetic data, and data-driven models allow manufacturers to improve production system efficiency, elevate product quality, and proactively address critical challenges in energy consumption and carbon footprint. This dual focus on operational excellence and sustainability ensures that factories can maintain competitive advantage while also contributing to specific environmental goals, e.g. reducing the pressure on ecosystems and natural resources. Since innovation capacity and competitiveness also requires a systemic understanding of an organization’s value creating structure, novel AI solutions should be implemented such that they can support all structures and phases of operation, in technical and non-technical terms.</p><p>Proposals should produce dedicated innovative explainable AI based solutions in advanced manufacturing for at least two of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>improve processes and operational efficiency, and reduce climate and environmental impact of processes and factories through dynamic selection of optimal processes and production parameters, exploiting AI for process modelling and/or optimisation;</li><li>avoid the production of defective parts using AI to detect process drift and anomalies and correct proactively defects in real time; and</li><li>maximise the fraction of regenerated components or materials used in the production using AI to optimise the material flow.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should demonstrate potential for these AI tools to adapt to changing production needs and real-time data, and should describe how industrial data access, confidentiality, and secure data-sharing will be addressed.</p><p>Projects are encouraged to link with AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in Testing and Experiment Facilities (TEFs), and further deployed via European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.</p><p>Proposals can optionally address the conditions for implementing the novel AI solutions within an organisations structure and value creating models, thereby contributing to systemic approach of implementing a smart organisation.</p><p>This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.</p>"

By using different AI approaches such as multimodal generative AI, foundation models, and agentic AI, the industry can move beyond conventional AI applications as e.g. predictive maintenance and quality control toward more intelligent, adaptive, and creative solutions.</p><p>AI-based solutions can deliver value at every stage of the process lifecycle. In design and engineering, they can enable new innovations and accelerate the development process. During operations, AI technologies can be employed to optimize processes, enhance reproducibility, adapt to changing conditions, and provide new forms of support for the workforce and enable autonomous operation. In value chains, AI can help to adapt faster and detect changing customer needs. These capabilities support faster innovation and strengthen competitiveness in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape. However, realizing this potential requires careful consideration of risks related to reliability, security, and trust, ensuring that AI solutions are effective, safe, and responsible.</p><p>Proposals should produce dedicated innovative AI-based solutions for the process industry for one of the following scopes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More effective and faster development of new materials and processes</li><li>Competitive and sustainable production, reducing the negative environmental impact of industry</li><li>Reduction of risks for the health of the workforce and for the environment and making workplaces in the process industries more attractive.</li> </ul><p>In the projects, user acceptance and training of the users as well as integration into the OT/IT landscape of the companies should be taken into account, e.g. through active engagement in design, development and integration of systems and processes.</p><p>This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Processes4Planet and AI, Data and Robotics.</p>"

The convergence of the Telco-Edge-Cloud continuum (3C) with open orchestration platforms will unlock the transformative potential of AI across strategic sectors, from mobility and energy to health and manufacturing, fostering new services and business models. Building a sovereign Open Internet Stack, rooted in open-source, interoperable and standard-based solutions, will reinforce trust, resilience and innovation, while ensuring Europe retains control over critical digital infrastructures. At the same time, decentralised and federated approaches to AI data processing, combined with breakthroughs in sustainable data centres, will help overcome Europe’s compute bottlenecks and dependencies, and reduce the environmental footprint of AI. By aligning with the Data Union Strategy and Common European Data Spaces, these efforts will deliver secure, compliant and adaptive data-sharing frameworks that empower citizens, businesses and administrations. Together, they will strengthen Europe’s ability to innovate, scale and lead globally in data and AI, anchoring digital sovereignty in line with EU values and strategic interests.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

This will address the needs of both supply and demand side of the rich and diverse eco-system of 3C European providers and verticals. This topic will stimulate the emergence at European and global scale of solutions that are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Open source and made in Europe, supporting trust, and sovereignty, and delivering credible alternative choices for citizens, governments and companies including start-ups and SMEs.</li><li>Paced for easy deployment by the rich European eco-systems of providers, integrators and verticals.</li><li>Interoperable, standard-based, decentralised solutions for enabling network effect.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals should address one or several of the following technology areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Network and Transport technologies including for example routing and virtual private networks, survivable mesh technologies.</li><li>Sovereign operating systems and firmware (including smartphones).</li><li>Open Source software productivity and supply chain technologies such as federated forges, independent and cross-platform development framework.</li> </ul><p>Applicants should devise a plan for ensuring that the solutions are designed for efficient deployment, with pre-configured, modular components that facilitate integration by a wide range of users, including SMEs, public administrations, research and education and service providers.</p><p>Applicants should detail development, integration, testing, deployment, uptake and operation activities. Focus will be on Open Source solutions and their integration and adoption in vertical use cases, to ensure replicability of the results and portability in different areas.</p><p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>That the proposed solution(s) has(ve) the technical maturity in terms of scalability, resiliency, advanced cryptographic protection (e.g. against emerging quantum threats via post-quantum cryptography), alignment with standards including for software and hardware supply chain and efficiency including environmental.</li><li>That there is a community with critical mass that actively supports the development with or without associated business model.</li><li>Evidence of use cases, interest and engagement from users and deployers of the solution.</li><li>Credible path to be part of the Open Internet Stack in terms of cataloguing, searchability, availability through app-stores and alignment with EU regulation.</li> </ul><p>Applicants should detail any relevant previous projects on which the project will expand.</p><p>Applicants should detail their plan to creating synergies with other topics such as those in the WP25 Open Internet Stack, 3C, Virtual Worlds/Web4.0 as well as like-minded initiatives on the same solution perimeter.</p><p>Proposals should also detail their strategy for maintenance, cataloguing, marketing, communication as well as the relationship with to the “Open Internet Stack Support for Scale” topic.</p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p><u>Financial support to third parties</u></p><p>If applicants opt for financial support to third parties, they should primarily target calls towards internet innovators and adopters of Open Source technologies. Applicants should provide the programme logic for the third-party projects, managing the projects lifecycle, and provide the necessary technical and non-technical support: these tasks cannot be implemented using the budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.</p>"

The convergence of the Telco-Edge-Cloud continuum (3C) with open orchestration platforms will unlock the transformative potential of AI across strategic sectors, from mobility and energy to health and manufacturing, fostering new services and business models. Building a sovereign Open Internet Stack, rooted in open-source, interoperable and standard-based solutions, will reinforce trust, resilience and innovation, while ensuring Europe retains control over critical digital infrastructures. At the same time, decentralised and federated approaches to AI data processing, combined with breakthroughs in sustainable data centres, will help overcome Europe’s compute bottlenecks and dependencies, and reduce the environmental footprint of AI. By aligning with the Data Union Strategy and Common European Data Spaces, these efforts will deliver secure, compliant and adaptive data-sharing frameworks that empower citizens, businesses and administrations. Together, they will strengthen Europe’s ability to innovate, scale and lead globally in data and AI, anchoring digital sovereignty in line with EU values and strategic interests.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Building a sovereign Open Internet Stack, rooted in open-source, interoperable and standard-based solutions, will reinforce trust, resilience and innovation, while ensuring Europe retains control over critical digital infrastructures. At the same time, decentralised and federated approaches to AI data processing, combined with breakthroughs in sustainable data centres, will help overcome Europe’s compute bottlenecks and dependencies, and reduce the environmental footprint of AI. By aligning with the Data Union Strategy and Common European Data Spaces, these efforts will deliver secure, compliant and adaptive data-sharing frameworks that empower citizens, businesses and administrations. Together, they will strengthen Europe’s ability to innovate, scale and lead globally in data and AI, anchoring digital sovereignty in line with EU values and strategic interests.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

This includes RegTech/GovTech//LegalTech applications such as digital tools offering real-time compliance guidance, automated rule-drafting assistants for policymakers, and multilingual chatbots providing regulatory support to businesses and professionals. Predictive analytics and risk-based approaches should allow tailored compliance pathways, while integration with national systems and the Single Digital Gateway should promote cross-border mutual recognition and application of the Once-Only Principle. Public administrations should be equipped with automated compliance assessment tools, real-time analytics dashboards, and interoperability frameworks to enhance and streamline regulatory oversight and cooperation. The technologies and solutions should contribute to the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency in AI-driven compliance solutions, including traceability and explainability of automated actions.</li><li>The solutions under Area 1 should adhere to open technical standards, ensuring scalability, inclusiveness, and co-development with private and public stakeholders. Robust cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, trust safeguards, security and privacy cryptographic protection, including via post-quantum cryptography, should be embedded, aligning with EU data protection and digital identity frameworks. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models should be harnessed, to the extent possible/reasonable, to enable data-driven feedback loops that support continuous policy learning, allowing regulators to monitor rule implementation, identify unnecessary burdens, and simplify legislation based on real-time evidence. Where appropriate, the actions under this Area should build on and integrate the privacy-enhancing (including anonymization) technologies developed under earlier topics in the Horizon Europe programme.</li><li>Area 2: The actions under this area should focus on the <strong><em>design and deployment of secure, scalable, and adaptive data management systems that automate key data processes</em></strong>, such as data curation, metadata tagging, ontology management and discovery, labelling, annotation, and quality control,<em> </em>developing and adapting appropriate AI methods and tools for these specific tasks. These systems should facilitate seamless integration and sharing of data across sectors and disciplines, ensuring interoperability, data provenance, data privacy and handling secured against emerging quantum threats via post-quantum cryptography, and compliance with applicable EU legal frameworks. Special emphasis is on enhancing data accuracy, representativeness, and relevance, particularly for use cases in industry, public services, citizen engagement, and the development of trustworthy AI applications, as well as the Common European Data Spaces. The development of such high-quality, semantically rich datasets will be essential to unlock the full potential of AI across domains.</li><li>Furthermore, the actions under Area 2 may also support the generation and use of high-quality synthetic data, including spatial synthetic data, to complement real-world datasets while preserving data privacy via advanced, state-of-the-art cryptographic protection. This may include, among others, the use of AI-enabled <strong>generative graphics pipelines</strong> to automate the creation of large-scale simulated environments and the application of <strong>parallelised and/or neuromorphic computing techniques</strong> to train AI models and artificial agents efficiently.</li> </ul><p>The actions under both areas should take into account the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre, particularly the blueprint for common European data spaces, and build synergies with related Union initiatives such as AI Factories, European Blockchain Services infrastructure, and the European Business Wallet, as well as with sector-specific Common European Data Spaces, and EU Digital Identity Wallet large scale pilots. Close collaboration with relevant European Partnerships, stakeholders, including industry, public administrations, and research organisations, will ensure that the systems meet the practical needs of data users while fostering innovation, competitiveness, and digital sovereignty within the Single Market.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This pilot supports the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, particularly its research and innovation efforts, which aims to advance core AI capabilities, especially in frontier AI, and support fundamental AI research. The initiative will pool strategic resources to push the technological frontiers of AI and drive scientific breakthroughs, ensuring that the project contributes to the EU's goal of maintaining European leadership in AI research. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Set up a network of excellent AI Labs in the EU and Associated Countries, raising visibility and strengthening collaboration in European AI research</li><li>Establish a model of cooperation among these labs and support the development of a strategic research agenda for fundamental research in AI.</li><li>Ensure that the network operates as a virtual institute across Europe, pooling resources and expertise.</li><li>Develop synergies with the AI in science efforts in RAISE.</li><li>Stimulate and support world-class research in AI, both fundamental and applied research. Building on Europe’s research strength, attract collaboration with industry and excellent AI talent.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Ensuring Europe's technological sovereignty in AI requires reinforcing and leveraging Europe's strengths, particularly its world-class AI research community.</p><p>The selected consortium should be composed by leading European AI research institutions. These AI research institutes should be entities with legal structure, dedicated facilities and, a significant number of research teams focusing on AI research. This category also includes multidisciplinary research institutions that host AI-focused branches meeting these criteria. The consortium will pilot a network of excellent European AI research institutes that will collaboratively address fundamental AI research topics, pushing the frontier of the domain. Participants will cooperate within a virtual institute, attracting talents, stimulating industrial initiatives, providing inputs for moonshot projects and developing research agendas for the ones retained by the EC. A substantial share of the project effort should be dedicated to advancing research.</p><p>To achieve these objectives, the consortium will undertake a range of dedicated activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The project will draw an ambitious strategic research agenda towards the next frontier in AI (in 5 years), including explicit targets and milestones;</li><li>The coordination of the participating institutes and their research in AI will be driven by a world class AI research program. The defined programmes will guide collaborative efforts and ensure a cohesive approach to advancing fundamental AI. Collaboration will, among other, be reinforced by jointly supervised PhDs and Postdocs.</li><li>The implementation of a world class AI research program, supporting PhDs and Postdocs as well as jointly agreed collaborative research projects<u>,</u> functioning as a distributed \"European AI Institute,\" reflecting the RAISE initiative's long-term vision and enhancing collaboration.</li> </ul><p>This topic will bring together excellent AI research Institutes in Europe to further develop basic science in AI. Given the importance of such consortium, every participating institution will have to demonstrate its excellence in AI Research through a number of objective criteria.</p><p>To ensure openness, during the first year, the project will establish a call for expressions of interest to identify additional leading European AI research labs and individual experts that may collaborate with the project through joint activities or other forms of cooperation to support the expected outcomes and the dedicated activities described in this topic. Proposals should describe the type of actions planned for these collaborations. Appropriate budget and effort should be allocated to ensure that such collaborations complement the network’s expertise and strengthen the implementation of the roadmap.</p><p>This initiative will also work in close collaboration with other initiatives in the European AI landscape, such as existing Networks of Excellence, AI societies and associations, and with the fundamental research activities in AI taking place in the horizontal call HORIZON-RAISE and in the EIC pathfinder initiatives to be integrated in RAISE. All proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>The project selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories and the Data Labs and exploit the various tools offered by the AI-on-demand-platform to share the result and further develop the community.</p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM(2025)723 Apply AI Strategy</p>"

In addition, entities established in third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the application[[See the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a> available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf.]].

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Apply AI Strategy highlights the need to accelerate the uptake of AI-powered robotics through sectoral pipelines that connect research and deployment. By developing advanced robotics skills based on foundation models and creating adaptable frameworks that can be transferred across different industrial contexts, including automotive, this topic will provide common tools and building blocks to strengthen those pipelines and ensure broad industrial relevance.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of advanced robotics skills (e.g. high precision autonomous pick and place manipulation, autonomous navigation in unstructured environments) using robotics foundation models, tailored for manufacturing. Creation of a comprehensive framework for general purpose and flexible robotics skills development with industry-relevant challenges, evaluation metrics and success criteria.</li><li>Facilitation of widespread deployment of robotics in manufacturing especially SMEs, through modular, adaptable, and reconfigurable solutions built on robotics foundation models, to meet evolving production needs</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposed project aims to significantly enhance robotics capabilities in manufacturing by developing advanced robotics skills (for example, task and environment aware autonomous pick and place with high precision and speed, human-robot collaboration, etc).</p><p>By leveraging the use of next-generation AI, including generative AI, to enable robots to better adapt to real-world environments and interact with human operators, and focusing on reconfigurability, the project will develop industry-agnostic solutions that can be easily adapted to different manufacturing environments.</p><p>The project will create a comprehensive framework for robotics skills development in manufacturing, including the initial definition of three technical challenges that must be clearly described at proposal stage, with evidence of their industrial relevance and potential impact. The detailed specification and design of these challenges may be further refined during the first phase of the project in collaboration with industry partners.</p><p>The project will organize a multi-stage competition for each of the three identified technical challenges. Each stage of the competition is expected to present an increased level of complexity compared to the previous one. The approach for designing the competitive process, including the use of FSTP, should aim at maximising the impact.</p><p>One of the key use cases for this project will be the automotive industry, which should be explicitly included in proposals either as a primary focus or as a dedicated use case, demonstrating how advanced robotics can enhance production efficiency and adaptability in this sector. Other use cases alongside the automotive one are allowed and encouraged, to demonstrate the industry-agnostic nature and the transferability of the developed solutions to different industrial contexts.</p><p>User-industry companies from the manufacturing sector (including automotive) should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and actively support the FSTP recipients in achieving powerful and exploitable results that benefit their industry.</p><p>Organization of the Challenge:</p><p><strong>Stage 1 – Open call:</strong> The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection of the 10 highest-ranked proposals for each of the three technical robotics skills, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, research organisation or public body secondary or higher education establishment, developer of robotics solutions, or a small team of organizations.</p><p><strong>Stage 2 – Competition among Stage 1 winners:</strong> The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 will receive a EUR 200,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 3 highest-ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.</p><p><strong>Stage 3 – Grand Finale (competition among Stage 2 winners):</strong> The 3 best teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 will receive a EUR 1,000,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges defined for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.</p><p>The consortium should define measures to support the team winning the grand finale in maximising the impact and uptake of its solutions.</p><p>Proposals must include a draft exploitation plan outlining how the solutions developed by the FSTP recipients will be taken up, with concrete support from the user-industry partners to ensure industrial relevance and future exploitation.</p><p>This scheme is repeated for each of the three technical challenges.</p><p>The consortium will ensure high visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships, and will seek to attract the best developers from the EU and associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various stages during the project and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.</p>"

The aim is to deliver concrete outputs that improve the conditions for use of the supported projects through credible technical, industrialisation and financial roadmaps, validated against investor requirements (e.g. EIB, InvestEU). Activities also include analyses of investor-readiness and supply-chain sovereignty.</li><li>Phase 2: For further information, see the indirectly managed action “HORIZON-CL4 Quantum Top-Up to InvestEU: Grand Challenge Phase 2” in the Cluster 4 part of the Horizon Europe 2026/2027 Work Programme. This CSA is designed to allow the best possible application in Phase 2 and the current CSA results may therefore inform applications by beneficiaries to investment support managed by the EIB under InvestEU (separate procedures).</li> </ul><p>Under Phase 1 projects are expected to establish a comprehensive technical and financial roadmap that demonstrates the potential of the proposed Q-INS solutions, and at least deliver evidence-based design and benchmarking packages for reduced-scale systems ( such as documentation, test/benchmark reports and evidence of pre-existing or externally financed prototypes) in one of the following two categories:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Category 1</strong> <strong>(cold-atoms Q-INS)</strong>: Q-INS based on cold-atom interferometry (or other technology of at least equivalent performance) featuring long-term navigation accuracy (&lt;10 m/hour) due to reduced drift with respect to commercial Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). End-user requirements together with documented benchmark evidence from existing or externally financed prototypes will be collected for demonstrations in maritime or aviation applications.</li><li><strong>Category 2</strong> (<strong>Chip-scale Q-INS</strong>): Low C-SWAP Q-INS measuring acceleration, rotation rate, and/or magnetic field, aimed at the implementation of chip-scale sensors based on defect centers and vacancies in crystals or on warm atomic vapours (including nuclear magnetic resonance), for applications e.g. in small satellites, UAVs, and autonomous transport.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should target systems that are already sufficiently mature to enable credible benchmarking and industrial road-mapping. Specific expected outcomes include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A detailed technical roadmap, including system architecture, integration strategy, performance milestones, risk assessments and industrialisation plan for scalable production</li><li>The industrialisation plan should be validated in conjunction with the EIB requirements, including commercialization timelines, and should include at least the following:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Detailed Q-INS architecture based on quantum sensing techniques hybridised with classical IMUs,</li><li>Compliance assessment for SWaP-C requirements, environmental resilience, and real-world integration,</li><li>An assessment of dependencies on non-EU suppliers of critical components and proposal of effective mitigation measures in view of a sovereign supply chain,</li><li>Potential list of end-users to capture system requirements and use-case constraints</li>   </ul> </li><li>A comprehensive financial roadmap and viability assessment covering business models, market analyses, commercialization pathways, revenue projections and investment criteria</li><li>Documented lab-validation/benchmarking of an existing or externally financed prototype (no EU funding of R&amp;I or prototype development in this CSA), with preliminary benchmark results.</li><li>An application strategy identifying target sectors (maritime, aviation, space, autonomous systems) and quantifiable advantages over classical IMUs.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The Grand Challenge on Quantum Sensors for Inertial Navigation aims to advance the development of quantum-enabled navigation systems for use in GNSS-denied or contested environments. Q-INS combines quantum sensors with classical inertial measurement subsystems to deliver reliable, resilient, and sovereign positioning capabilities. The topic supports the EU’s ambition to strengthen technological sovereignty in strategic navigation infrastructures, aligned with the objectives of the STEP and the Digital Decade.</p><p>Under this topic (Phase 1), projects are expected to deliver a comprehensive technical, industrialisation, and financial roadmap, including criteria for investment readiness, bankability, risk assessment, and scalability, thereby laying the groundwork for future investments via EU financial instruments under InvestEU, which benefits from a dedicated top-up from Horizon Europe for this purpose<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Under Phase 1, Expressions of Interest from potential end-user partners are strongly encouraged. Tailored advisory services from EIB Advisory may support financial structuring to prepare for Phase 2.</p><p>Projects funded under this action are expected to span approximately six months, with an EU contribution up to EUR 0.5 million.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] HORIZON-CL4 Indirectly managed action “Quantum Top-Up to InvestEU: Grand Challenge Phase 2”</p>"

Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Other Eligible Conditions</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid a situation of technological dependency on a non-EU source, in a global context that requires the EU to take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities established in Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Proposals for this topic are expected to address and provide credible solutions to at least <strong>two major technical roadblocks</strong> currently limiting the advancement of photonic quantum computing such as:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The lack of deterministic, high-efficiency photonic entanglement and loss-tolerant architectures suitable for fault-tolerant scaling</li><li>The absence of a standardised, integrated control stack combining photonic hardware, firmware, and system software with reliable benchmarking across platforms</li> </ul><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>By 2028, demonstration of a photonic NISQ processor with ≥100 photonic qubits, integrating deterministic single-photon sources, low-loss waveguides, on-chip detectors, and a firmware stack (scheduler, controller, compiler), validated via hardware-agnostic benchmarks and hybrid photonic-HPC applications demonstrating classical-quantum crossover</li><li>By 2030, delivery of a full-stack, high-connectivity photonic quantum computer, with modular scalability, integrated on-chip and fibre-based interconnects, and high-fidelity gates (e.g. error rates ≤10⁻³) with an indicative target of 1 000 photonic qubits, laying the groundwork for prototype demonstrations of quantum utility on industrially relevant workloads.</li><li>System-level interoperability and standardisation, with published interface specifications across photonic quantum hardware and software stacks including packaging, APIs, compiler interfaces, and cloud protocols compatible with telecom wavelengths</li><li>Validation of entanglement distribution across modules through standardised protocols and field-demonstration of interconnected photonic quantum processors</li><li>Acceleration of industrialisation and commercialisation, including a roadmap for pilot manufacturing lines, quality assurance protocols, and development of a sovereign European supply chain for photonic quantum technologies</li><li>Demonstration of project results through a <strong>concrete use case provided by a major end-user</strong> partner within the consortium, validating the platform’s relevance and performance under real operational constraints.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals for this topic are expected to be <strong>led by a startup</strong> with demonstrated expertise in photonic quantum computing. The startup should collaborate with relevant academic, industrial, and RTO partners to ensure both technological depth and market orientation. The consortium should also include <strong>at least one major end-user</strong> whose operational needs will shape the platform design, and whose infrastructure will host the field demonstration of the project’s results.</p><p>Proposals should implement a coordinated, durable R&amp;I programme that integrates hardware, software, system architecture, and application-level use cases. Activities should include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Platform development advancing open, scalable photonic quantum processors with semiconductor and/or glass-based photonic chips, integrated control electronics, firmware, and robust error mitigation and correction schemes</li><li>System integration realising modular quantum nodes with photonic interconnects and validating scalable architectures under realistic noise, loss, and control constraints</li><li>Software stack co-design integrating low-level firmware, compilers, hybrid algorithms, and network APIs to demonstrate application-level quantum advantage and HPC interoperability</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to build upon prior Quantum Flagship results and demonstrate capacity to contribute actively to the governance and strategic coordination of the EU quantum computing ecosystem, including synergies with STEP, Chips JU, IPCEI projects and EuroHPC.</p>"

In addition, entities established in third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the application[[See the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a> available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf.]].

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Significant technology progress and innovation through challenge-driven approach in the fields of aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks.</li><li>Increased competitivity and visibility of the Generative AI community in Europe, in demonstrating their capability to achieve challenging tasks within the aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication sectors.</li><li>Increased adoption of Generative AI in aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks through tangible progress and achievement demonstrated via the challenge-driven process. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Generative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization.</p><p>Each proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact of the action.</p><p>User industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, provide to the competing FSTP recipients the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry needs.</p><p>Proposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small team of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions.</p><p>For each proposal:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Stage 1 - Open call:</strong> The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow to select for Stage 2 the 20 highest-ranked proposals, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single SME, developer of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations led by such SME</li><li><strong>Stage 2 - Competition among Stage 1 winners:</strong> The 20 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.</li><li><strong>Stage 3– Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners):</strong> The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,000,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.</li> </ul><p>The consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.</p><p>Such multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.</p><p>Each proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.</p><p>The projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the grant agreement signature.</p><p>For each proposal, an amount of EUR 5,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, a budget of EUR 8,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge.</p><p>The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives with sufficient level of information. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.</p><p>Visibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects<sup>[1]</sup> and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In particular, proposals in telecommunication should exploit potential synergies with projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08, HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-09 and HORIZON-CL4-2025-04-DATA-02; proposals in pharma/drug should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from Cluster 1 and IHI Innovative Health Initiative; proposals in the aerospace should exploit potential synergies with relevant projects from the clean aviation JU and other similar projects/initiatives.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>While today’s AI agents still have limited capabilities, advances in model architecture, memory, reasoning, and autonomous behaviour are paving the way to unlocking their potential across economic sectors. The Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>acknowledges this trend and the need to advance research on next-generation AI agents. Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Significant improvements in the autonomy, robustness and reliability of AI agents through advanced planning mechanisms, memory management, and reasoning capabilities.</li><li>Innovative multi-agent frameworks and protocols demonstrating effective decentralized coordination and collaboration among multiple AI agents beyond the capabilities of individual agents.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Next-generation AI agents are autonomous systems powered by large AI language models (e.g., large language models or large multimodal models), that can plan, utilize tools and perform actions autonomously to achieve specified goals based on high-level instructions. The large AI model acts as the agent's \"brain,\" capable of interpreting instructions, generating plans, and using tools. This capability enables agents to autonomously plan and adapt behaviour in real-time to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. AI Agents hold significant promise in numerous applications areas such as data analytics and coding.</p><p>Effective AI agents require careful design, incorporating structured planning and reasoning methods to manage complex tasks, and be equipped with appropriate validation and monitoring techniques. Multi-agent collaboration frameworks further enhance capabilities by enabling structured interactions among multiple agents.</p><p>Key aspects in designing effective AI agents include robust planning, reasoning, and search mechanisms that allow agents to approach complex tasks by breaking them down into structured subgoals. Effective memory and state management are necessary to maintaining coherent long-term interactions, achieved through a balanced integration of short-term and external long-term memory solutions. Moreover, integrating external tools and APIs is essential for overcoming limitations in large AI models, enhancing agent performance in tasks requiring accuracy and reliability.</p><p>Potential research areas include enhancing AI agent autonomy through advanced self-planning and self-optimization capabilities, enabling agents to improve their decision-making and strategic planning. Other research directions include innovation in memory-augmented AI agents to facilitate robust long-term reasoning and lifelong learning; developing advanced multi-agent frameworks specifically tailored for collaborative agents, including research on AI agent frameworks based on mixed AI architectures, and advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities to enable real-world applications.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform.</p><p>Projects selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub. Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM xxxx(2025) Apply AI Strategy - PLACEHOLDER</p>"

Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Other Eligible Conditions</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid a situation of technological dependency on a non-EU source, in a global context that requires the EU to take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities established in Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, entities established in third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the application[[See the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a> available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf.]]. In any case, the association agreement to the Programme must apply by the time of the signature of the grant agreement.</p><p>For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, may not participate in the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, that their participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high-risk supplier) cannot submit guarantees.[[<sup> </sup>The guarantees shall in particular substantiate that, for the purpose of the action, measures are in place to ensure that: a) control over the applicant legal entity is not exercised in a manner that retrains or restricts its ability to carry out the action and to deliver results, that imposes restrictions concerning its infrastructure, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the purpose of the action, or that undermines its capabilities and standards necessary to carry out the action; b) access by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity to sensitive information relating to the action is prevented; and the employees or other persons involved in the action have a national security clearance issued by an eligible country, where appropriate; c) ownership of the intellectual property arising from, and the results of, the action remain within the recipient during and after completion of the action, are not subject to control or restrictions by non-eligible countries or non-eligible country entity, and are not exported outside the eligible countries, nor is access to them from outside the eligible countries granted, without the approval of the eligible country in which the legal entity is established.]]</p></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Described in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-15-general-annexes_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annex B</a> of the Work Programme General Annexes.</p></div></div><div><h4>4.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Industrial jobs are transformed through AI-based human-machine interactions (and skills linked to them) which enhance flexibility, inclusion, well-being, up-skilling, career evolution and knowledge sharing;</li><li>Increased competitiveness and sustainability of advanced manufacturing industries by means of knowledge formalization and adaptability of the machines to workers and markets based on different cultures.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Innovative AI approaches are poised to revolutionise human-machine collaboration in factories by fostering an environment where technology and human expertise synergistically enhance each other. AI can enhance the value of the companies by capturing and formalising the knowledge which is dispersed and not explicit. This allows companies to really own the knowledge and use it to reduce the onboarding time of new employees and support personnel upskilling to adapt to the evolving technological landscape. AI has a great potential to make task simpler by reducing the complexity offering intuitive interfaces and real-time feedback allowing workforce to be more efficient and effective while facilitating access to more complex tasks including those involving various forms of planning. AI can also adapt the interaction of automation with the worker taking into account particular needs of the human, including adaptation to the different abilities of the workers and facilitating inclusion. Finally, AI can be used to allow easier export of automation produced in EU by facilitating its interaction with workforce having different cultures adapting the interaction of the machines to the different needs.</p><p>Proposals should produce dedicated innovative AI approaches for human-machine collaboration in advanced manufacturing to be applied in at least two of following fields:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Human-AI Co-Learning and knowledge capture to share competences, capture expert knowledge, provide interactive mentoring to up-skill the workforce, and support re-qualification and continuous training – leading to increased knowledge at factory level and avoiding loss of know-how.</li><li>Human-AI teamwork thanks to innovative natural interaction models (considering the e.g. related hardware interfaces and/or collaborative machine tools), enabling to control complexity in cognitive cooperating production systems, including planning activities at shop floor level.</li><li>Interfaces with automation which automatically adapt to the need of the humans including different abilities and different cultural needs.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should integrate a gender perspective and avoid any type of discrimination in the design and deployment of AI systems and human-machine interaction models, including addressing differences in user needs, such as needs of persons with disabilities, physical and cognitive ergonomics and training pathways. Proposals are also expected to identify and address other potential biases in AI systems to promote inclusive design that ensures safe and effective use by all workers. Human/AI collaboration requires utmost sensitivity to and consideration of human values and consideration of ethical principles as represented in Digital Humanism, therefore, appropriate consideration must also be given to the contribution of SSH.</p><p>This topic is linked to the Apply AI Strategy, therefore proposals should seek collaboration with relevant initiatives.</p><p>In addition, proposals are invited to build on the results of past projects on Extended Reality Technologies (XR), such as HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-13, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-14, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-25, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-06, HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-28.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to Destination ‘Leadership in materials and production for Europe’.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Made in Europe and AI, Data and Robotics.</p>"

Building a sovereign Open Internet Stack, rooted in open-source, interoperable and standard-based solutions, will reinforce trust, resilience and innovation, while ensuring Europe retains control over critical digital infrastructures. At the same time, decentralised and federated approaches to AI data processing, combined with breakthroughs in sustainable data centres, will help overcome Europe’s compute bottlenecks and dependencies, and reduce the environmental footprint of AI. By aligning with the Data Union Strategy and Common European Data Spaces, these efforts will deliver secure, compliant and adaptive data-sharing frameworks that empower citizens, businesses and administrations. Together, they will strengthen Europe’s ability to innovate, scale and lead globally in data and AI, anchoring digital sovereignty in line with EU values and strategic interests.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

These consider tools to ensure data quality (e.g. prevention of data sets imbalance or inconsistency across distributed data sources), volume optimisation for data transfers across environments, and distributed data management, all while preserving data privacy and preventing data leaks (e.g. via advanced cryptographic protection such as post-quantum cryptography for resistance to emerging quantum threats).</li><li>New tools and mechanisms to measure, monitor and improve end-to-end energy efficiency and sustainability of AI data processing across the compute continuum, including the exploration of energy and sustainability implications of the heterogeneous AI processing architectures and their impact in the compute infrastructure design and long-term sustainability.</li> </ul><p>Successful project proposals should showcase proposed developments in at least two complementary use cases in different domains. These use cases should demonstrate the value gained and potential impact of project achievements in real-world situations, as well as address key applications and sectors critical to Europe's competitiveness. Use cases should provide compelling examples and scenarios and cater for the reproducibility of results' added value and impact in additional economic sectors.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demand-side driven validation of open orchestration platforms across the telco-cloud edge continuum unlocking notably the transformative value of AI for European businesses, driving business growth in multiple industries strategic for Europe.</li><li>Enabling the path towards sustainability and competitiveness of key vertical sectors in the EU, exploiting the innovative features of 3C/ telco-edge-cloud, including network features such as API (Application Program Interface) aggregation, slicing, automation, latency, security, ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication), reconfigurability, to significantly improve quality of service, resilience, sustainability and other performance parameters of digital communications.</li><li>The demand pilots will have a clear sector relevance, with one pilot addressing the future of smart mobility including the automotive sector.</li><li>A vibrant ecosystem around 3C/telco-edge-cloud infrastructure, targeting SMEs and start-ups to develop innovative services and new business models validation and marketplace exploitation strategies, as well as paths to commercialization or replicability.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The term “Connected, Collaborative, Computing (3C) Network” refers to a telco-edge-cloud, secure multi-provider and multi-technology, communication system that hosts network functions and workloads for and beyond connectivity (e.g. 6G, AI Storage/Compute, networking, Security ISAC , and any other application or capability) as a service (aaS). Key features of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud network include programmability, fast service creation, security and privacy, mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain deployments. 3C/ telco-edge-cloud networks enable innovative use cases for an EU Digital Market that integrate communication, collaboration and computing capabilities in competitive and sustainable business models that will reinforce EU competitiveness and contribute to digital sovereignty, in particular through the use of Open Internet Stack components. Resulting solutions should be available for use in the public sector (for instance for justice systems).</p><p>The 3C Network large-scale pilot funded under <em>topic HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-DATA-08: Large-scale pilots for supply end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities for Telco Edge Cloud deployments, as a basis for Connected Collaborative Computing Networks (3C networks) (RIA)</em> is setting up end-to-end integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond. The main target is to research and validate the integration of device, network, cloud and edge computing, and communication capabilities for telco edge cloud deployments to realize a ubiquitous mesh of computing and communication resources. As a main outcome the supply side pilot establishes an open orchestration platform across the telco-cloud-edge continuum, exploits the transformative value of AI and builds on the integration of solutions developed by the Open Euro Stack.</p><p>Demand- side pilot demonstrators called in this topic will build on the above supply side large-scale pilot and integrate future domain-specific applications and services with an emerging European 3Cs/ telco-edge-cloud infrastructure, leveraging different network features. Key features will include security and privacy solutions offering resistance to emerging quantum threats (such as via post-quantum cryptography), mobility, and service continuity across inter-domain and multi-cloud deployments and ecosystems.</p><p>Up to two pilot demonstrators on below listed specific verticals are expected<u>.</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>One pilot demonstrator focusing on <strong>Mobility </strong>covering specific areas of transport, logistics and the Automotive industry. The pilot should support the strategy as developed by the Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance identified in the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/business-and-industry/boosting-european-car-sector_en\">Automotive Action plan</a>, in particular Pillars 3 (AI models) and 5 (Large-scale testing), which will be launched in 2025.</li><li>One pilot demonstrator focusing on another vertical sector such as energy, smart communities, industrial virtual worlds, health, agrifood or manufacturing.</li> </ul><p>They would be driven by a consortium including partners both from the demand (user) and infrastructure supply side. The pilot demonstrators should take advantage of open application interfaces, explore the possibilities of AI, “virtual worlds”, and other innovative technologies for practical implementation in the referred vertical domains. They should leverage combined investments in network infrastructure, computing and connectivity infrastructure as an enabler for more extensive set of digital innovation, with cognitive cloud computing and swarm intelligence, generative AI and LLM, as well as on-boarding of XR/AR technologies, being ranked most important.</p><p>Proposals are expected to detail a robust data governance model for the data generated and processed within the pilots. This model should address data sovereignty, interoperability with Common European Data Spaces, and alignment with principles from initiatives like Gaia-X. It should outline clear mechanisms for secure and compliant data sharing between the demand-side (users) and supply-side (infrastructure providers), establishing the trust necessary for a functional data economy on top of the 3C infrastructure.</p><p>Pilot demonstrators should demonstrate the evolution from virtualised and cloud-native network functions towards automated network operations enabling agile and green IoT-edge computing solutions and decentralised intelligence. They should also demonstrate benefits for infrastructure providers to operate networks more efficiently and move beyond traditional connectivity-service models to higher value-added services.</p><p>Demonstrations will respond to the ever more demanding processing power of AI through integration on-device level and changes triggered by GenAI affecting global communication infrastructures. Orchestration of workloads across the telco-cloud-edge continuum from distributed sensors and actuators to the edge and cloud is a crucial part of innovation as AI becomes more resource-intensive.</p><p>The pilot demonstrators should take into consideration the recommendations on user requirements from the advisory group of end users, as well as liaise with the collaboration and support action (CSA) funded under WP25 to bridge between the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply pilot funded under WP25 and the demand pilots funded under WP26-27.</p><p>The pilots should exploit in particular open APIs and open-source components as developed by the supply side pilot, e.g. including the use of capabilities to implement specific communication management services (e.g. Open RAN security, RIC VNF…), up-take of existing standards and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, ANUKET, Nephio, CAMARA, etc.).</p><p>The pilot demonstrators should include testing, validation and demonstration of prototypes of agile virtualised network functions combined with ubiquitous mesh of integrated devices, computing and communication resources in operational environments, ensuring security and privacy, protection also in the face of emerging quantum threats, energy efficiency, transparency and control of the ecological footprint, as well as sustainable artificial intelligence services.</p><p>The pilot demonstrators are expected to re-use as far as possible existing open-source frameworks, i.e. open-source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key technology components for the operation of the 3C/ telco-edge-cloud supply-side large scale pilot. These open-source frameworks should be made available to the Open Internet Stack Support for Scale.</p><p>The proposals should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant vertical sectors, with a particular attention to the involvement of SMEs, scale-ups and start-ups.</p><p>The pilots should establish a high degree of relations and collaborate with complementary EU funded research activities, like the Smart Networks and Systems Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) projects, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Sovereign edge/cloud infrastructure” R&amp;I areas, the PPP virtual worlds, CCAM partnership as well as support of SW-defined vehicle initiative under the Chips JU.</p>"

The convergence of the Telco-Edge-Cloud continuum (3C) with open orchestration platforms will unlock the transformative potential of AI across strategic sectors, from mobility and energy to health and manufacturing, fostering new services and business models. Building a sovereign Open Internet Stack, rooted in open-source, interoperable and standard-based solutions, will reinforce trust, resilience and innovation, while ensuring Europe retains control over critical digital infrastructures. At the same time, decentralised and federated approaches to AI data processing, combined with breakthroughs in sustainable data centres, will help overcome Europe’s compute bottlenecks and dependencies, and reduce the environmental footprint of AI. By aligning with the Data Union Strategy and Common European Data Spaces, these efforts will deliver secure, compliant and adaptive data-sharing frameworks that empower citizens, businesses and administrations. Together, they will strengthen Europe’s ability to innovate, scale and lead globally in data and AI, anchoring digital sovereignty in line with EU values and strategic interests.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Project results are expected to contribute to one or more of the following outcomes (see more details in scope):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrated innovations that substantially improve heat removal from high-power AI chips (e.g. direct on-chip cooling, advanced thermal interface materials, multi-scale thermal management), enabling higher performance without thermal throttling. This should lead to lower cooling energy needs and higher reliability for dense AI workloads.</li><li>Prototypes of novel backup power systems (such as graphene-enhanced batteries) that operate with minimal cooling requirements, improving data centre resilience and enabling better use of renewable power.</li><li>New methods and frameworks that optimise the entire data centre for energy-efficient AI processing. This includes intelligent workload scheduling and AI model optimisation techniques to reduce energy use (e.g. carbon-aware job scheduling and power capping to cut energy demand and peak temperatures), as well as designs for integrating on-site/off-site renewables and waste-heat reuse.</li><li>As a result of all the above bullet points, an open pilot demonstration site that allows for the testing and integration of the outcomes of these projects and serves as the European reference for showcasing the breakthroughs and cutting-edge technologies for energy-efficient and sustainable data centres developed under this topic. This site should serve as a model for technology uptake for the European data centre industry.</li> </ul><p>Outcomes should demonstrate potential for improved power usage effectiveness and utilisation of waste heat in external applications, aligned with European targets for carbon-neutral heating/cooling.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Actions should address the following development areas:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Direct on-chip cooling and thermal management, including novel and innovative cooling techniques applied at chip and module level (direct liquid cooling, heat spreaders, thermal interface materials, and advanced packaging) and multi-scale thermal management techniques.</li><li>Energy-efficient power backup and storage systems: Innovations in early-stage energy storage concepts (graphene-enhanced batteries, supercapacitors, and other emerging battery chemistries) and approaches for net-zero backup.</li><li>Sustainable data centre architectures and AI workload optimization: addressing AI-driven workload scheduling, adaptive power management, dynamic resource allocation and integration of data centre heat capture and reuse.</li><li>Materials research for energy efficiency: Projects to make use of existing research in new materials and components supporting energy efficiency and thermal management, and to employ these for data centres benefit.</li><li>Optimisation of data centre operation and functioning: explore AI solutions to optimize the Data centre functioning, computing architecture, and virtualization, minimizing its carbon and environmental footprint.</li><li>Integration of data centres into energy systems and the wider region: including solutions that integrate Data centres into energy system planning and operation.</li> </ol><p>Aside from these, the pilot demonstration site must allow to combine the outcomes supplied by the other funded projects in the topic and enable for showcasing, benchmarking, and promoting their results across interested industrial stakeholders, including the European data centre and collocation industry, as well as other AI data centre operators, such as cloud and edge computing providers.</p><p>Overall, this topic is expected to fund four projects. Three projects are expected to address expected outcomes 1-3, while a fourth project is expected for expected outcome 4 (the open pilot demonstration site). For projects addressing expected outcomes 1-3 at least two use cases should showcase each project results. </p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 5 HORIZON-CL5-2027-05-D4-06: Thermal energy optimisation and waste heat recovery of high energy demand IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> proposes a comprehensive set of measures to notably harness the transformative potential of AI. It lays down targeted measures to boost AI use in key strategic sectors of the EU economy including healthcare, mobility and manufacturing for example. With challenges designed to spark breakthroughs in such strategic sectors, the current topic will directly support key activities of the Apply AI Strategy.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI Strategy's prioritised sectors driven by challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions.</li><li>Increase competitiveness and visibility of the relevant AI community within key application domains, and promote collaborative approaches for AI development in these domains, fostering the ecosystem.</li><li>Increase adoption of AI technologies across the following three key application domains: healthcare, advanced manufacturing (including AI-powered robotics) and in-vehicle autonomous driving.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The Challenge-Driven AI Innovation Booster aims to drive significant technological progress and innovation in Apply AI prioritised sectors through challenge-oriented, AI-powered solutions. This initiative seeks to boost Europe's developer community and the adoption of powerful, trustworthy AI solutions in three strategic domains such as:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>In healthcare - advanced AI will accelerate diagnostics and treatment plans, enhance robotic surgery, or improve patient care through predictive analytics.</li><li>In advanced manufacturing - advanced AI will optimize production processes, improve quality control and product design, or enable predictive maintenance.</li><li>In autonomous driving - advanced AI will enhance vehicle safety, improve navigation systems, or optimize traffic management. Provided sufficient quality of the proposals received, at least one selected project will focus on in-vehicle autonomous driving applications, in line with the Automotive Action Plan, ensuring coordination with the announced Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance.</li> </ul><p>Each proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above.</p><p>It is expected to focus primarily on the definition and organization of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as on the accompanying support to the SMEs/teams taking part in each of the challenges.</p><p>User-industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core partners in each consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the project results and therefore support the challenge participants to reach the most powerful and exploitable results benefiting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive, but the proposal must include a draft exploitation plan focused on how the solutions developed by the third parties will be taken up, with support from the user-industry partners for their future exploitation.</p><p>The consortium leading the project is responsible for the various stages of the challenges. This consortium should provide the necessary support resources during each stage of the competition (including technical assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy) and, most importantly, the consortium should ensure that the teams competing for and receiving financial support to third parties have access to relevant data to fine-tune models and build high-impact solutions meeting industry needs.</p><p>Proposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where advanced AI can make the difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to define challenging problems to solve with advanced AI solutions, which then drive the rest of the project. Based on such challenges, each project consortium should organize a multi-staged competition with an increasing level of complexity. In the different stages (see below), third parties, either single SMEs or small teams of organisations led by an SME, compete to address the challenges with advanced AI solutions.</p><p>For each proposal:</p><p><strong>Stage 1</strong> -<strong> Open call:</strong> The consortium launches an open call for proposals. A challenge, open to all, will allow the selection for Stage 2 of the 10 highest-ranked proposals according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution is expected to be submitted either by a single SME, developer of advanced AI solutions, or a small team of organizations led by such SME.</p><p><strong>Stage 2 </strong>-<strong> Competition among Stage 1 winners:</strong> The 10 teams or organisations selected from Stage 1 receive a EUR 300,000 FSTP grant each in accordance with their successfully selected proposal (which addresses the tasks and challenges defined for this stage by the consortium). At the end of Stage 2, the 4 highest-ranked solutions will be selected for the next stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria.</p><p><strong>Stage 3 </strong>–<strong> Grand finale (Competition among Stage 2 winners):</strong> The 4 teams or organisations selected from Stage 2 receive EUR 2,250,000 FSTP grants each in accordance with their successfully selected proposals to address the tasks and challenges for this stage. In conjunction, they will prepare for the grand finale that will identify the best performing solution at the end of Stage 3 according to the evaluation methodology defined by the consortium.</p><p>The consortium should define measures to support the winners in maximizing the impact and uptake of their solutions. For instance, after the end of the FSTP grant, the best-performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be considered.</p><p>Such a multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the projects funded under this action, each addressing a different sector.</p><p>Each proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, and propose a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, in addition to all mandatory requirements as concerns financial support to third parties. The beneficiaries will also be in charge of implementing the evaluation methodology and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the participants in the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the competitions.</p><p>The projects selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are expected to collaborate among themselves to make economies of scale in sharing best practices, defining processes for organizing the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, organizing dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the linked actions is expected to be formalized by a collaboration agreement after the grant agreement signature.</p><p>For each proposal, a total of EUR 3,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 1, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 2. In addition, EUR 9,000,000 is foreseen to be distributed among the winners of Stage 2, in the form of FSTP grants, to prepare for Stage 3 of the challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the objectives and expected results. This amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning teams of Stage 2, who are expected to develop further their solutions and compete for Stage 3.</p><p>Visibility would be important; therefore, dissemination and communication campaigns are key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the visibility and prestige of their challenge and to attract the best developers from the eligible countries to compete, particularly SMEs, alone or within a team competing for the challenges.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring.</p><p>When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform and, if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p>Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with relevant projects and develop synergies with other relevant International, European, national, or regional initiatives. Projects selected in this topic will link to the resources offered by the AI Factories, including the Data Labs. The results may be validated in the Testing and Experiment Facilities and further deployed via the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) and will contribute to the Apply AI strategy.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM(2025) 723 Apply AI Strategy</p>"

For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities established in Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, entities established in third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the application[[See the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a> available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf.]].

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Apply AI Strategy emphasises acceleration pipelines to ensure a smooth transition from research to deployment of AI-powered robotics. Projects under this topic will deliver common frameworks and reusable building blocks that can serve multiple sectors and use cases, reinforcing Europe’s ability to bring AI-driven robotics to scale.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Wider and faster deployment of robotics, bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users.</li><li>Development and implementation of modular and interoperable integration frameworks and solutions, including standardized protocols for data, training and safety testing, evaluation and validation of robotic solutions in key use cases</li><li>Improved competitiveness of European industries, notably SMEs via the development of advanced robotics systems, intelligent planning and control systems, user feedback rendering techniques and cutting-edge AI innovations</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The project will address the current European gap in system integration capabilities for robotics solutions addressing the various needs of industries. The project will aim at disseminating a deep understanding of state-of-the-art robotics components, including both hardware and software, and expertise in addressing interoperability issues for the upskilling of system integrators.</p><p>To maximise the impact and adaptability of deployed systems, the approach should consider the most appropriate tools to speed up integration processes and suitable AI design, training and inference methodologies, ensuring scalability, transferability, transparency, robustness, flexibility, and real-world applicability in diverse industrial environments, and should remain adaptable to the latest technological developments.</p><p>Integration frameworks will promote the use of energy-efficient AI models and hardware ('Green AI'), alongside carbon-aware deployment and operational strategies for robotic system. Where relevant, projects should contribute to open and widely recognised standards to foster interoperability and uptake across the robotics ecosystem. To enhance safety and performance, projects may include high-fidelity simulation environments or digital twins as testbeds for training, validation and verification, with measures to ensure smooth transfer from simulation to real-world deployment.</p><p>By bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users, these integrators will enable the creation of seamless, reliable and scalable robotics systems that can be easily adopted by industries, especially SMEs, thereby supporting more flexible and efficient production processes.</p><p>The project is expected to deliver:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A deployable, modular integration framework, validated through at least three real-world industrial pilots covering different reference scenarios to demonstrate that the approach can be adapted to varied industrial needs and company sizes, including both SMEs and larger manufacturers. This framework should provide, for example, a common software layer, standard interfaces to connect to existing workflow and legacy system, possibly also to connect various robot components, coordinate multiple robots and link them with additional AI tools and IoT environments, as well as tested configuration templates and clear guidelines to ensure safe and efficient use.</li><li>An Integration Kit, building on this framework, which offers ready-to-use modules, example configurations and practical tools that help system integrators and companies to set up, test and run AI-enabled robotics solutions more quickly and with reduced technical effort.</li><li>Where relevant, high-fidelity digital twin testbeds should be linked to each pilot, allowing safe and realistic testing and training before deployment, and supporting a smooth transition from virtual models to actual production lines.</li><li>Reusable, datasets (compliant with relevant regulation and IP protection) and practical benchmark tasks, made available to the wider robotics and AI community, to support further development and comparison of new solutions while respecting European data protection rules.</li><li>A clear Step-by-Step Adoption Guide aimed at SMEs and other end-users, providing easy-to-follow instructions, practical checklists and examples to help companies plan, budget and implement AI-driven robotics in a safe and cost-effective way, even if they have limited in-house expertise, and including guidance to navigate regulatory compliance and certification.</li><li>Concrete contributions to relevant open standards and clear guidance on certification pathways, to help ensure compliance with European regulations and build trust in the safe use of AI in robotics. Projects are expected to make full use of existing robotics resources and assets made available through the AI-on-Demand Platform, such as the EuroCORE repository and other relevant shared tools, to maximise synergies, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure broad dissemination and reuse of results within the European AI and robotics community.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA.</p>"

Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>Leadership in frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum, Photonics and Semiconductors is essential to Europe’s economic security and global competitiveness. Building on the ambition of becoming the “AI Continent” and in line with the concrete actions devised in the Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup>, the EU will consolidate its world-class research ecosystem through initiatives like the RAISE network of AI science labs, the development of safe and efficient frontier AI models, and the deployment of next-generation AI agents and robotics in strategic sectors. In parallel, a long-term quantum strategy will reinforce Europe’s excellence across quantum computing, sensing and communication, supported by new infrastructures and standardisation to secure technological sovereignty. Photonics and semiconductor technologies will remain critical enablers for the digital and green transitions, with investments in advanced integrated photonic devices and resilient semiconductor ecosystems ensuring Europe’s capacity to innovate, scale and compete globally. Foresight and support to emerging materials and technologies will further strengthen Europe’s position at the cutting edge to make sure Europe’s does not miss the emergence of new disruptive technologies, aligning with the Draghi report and the Competitiveness Compass to secure a cohesive, sovereign and future-proof European industrial base.</p><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The Apply AI Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> also seeks to bolster EU capabilities and achieve excellence in AI to support the development of European frontier models. As part of the Frontier AI Initiative, which brings together Europe’s leading actors in the field, this topic will support the development of sovereign frontier AI ensuring safety by design. This topic directly contributes to the Apply AI Strategy. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthened European capabilities in the development of frontier AI models.</li><li>Improved computational efficiency of frontier AI models, resulting in reduced computational costs.</li><li>Enhanced safety of advanced AI systems based on frontier AI models through the development and implementation of safe-by-design principles and/or AI agents acting as safety evaluators.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>To advance developments of frontier AI models towards highest-level performance, while ensuring energy efficiency, addressing computational constraints, and strengthening safety. The approach of this topic is twofold. First, it aims to advance the AI field through the development and training of a frontier AI model. The AI model should demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, have multimodal capabilities, and be optimized for agentic AI capabilities such as tool use, reasoning, and autonomous problem-solving. Second, this topic supports research on comprehensive methods to reduce the computational demands of frontier AI models and to ensure their safety, including technical methodologies such as automated testing and interpretability.</p><p>The primary drivers behind computational efficient AI systems are the urgent challenges posed by the growing energy footprint of AI and current computational limitations. Modern AI models, especially frontier AI models, require substantial computational resources, with a significant impact in the environment. Additionally, they create barriers to entry to those interested in advancing the AI field. Key research areas include compression and distillation techniques aimed at reducing the complexity of large AI models. Innovations in AI architectures are also relevant, with a focus on innovative models that significantly lower computational demands for training and inference. Further, algorithmic approaches aimed at minimizing computational load during pre-training, post-training, and inference can also be considered.</p><p>Ensuring the safety of AI systems is essential, especially as AI models become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. Potential research areas to be considered include addressing misalignment, particularly the unintentional misalignment of large AI models. Work in this area could explore methods to detect and mitigate sophisticated misbehaviour, such as alignment faking, reward hacking of human oversight, and encoded reasoning in chain-of-thought (CoT). Additionally, research could focus on enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, jailbreaks, and backdoors. Further potential areas for innovation include advancing AI models transparency and interpretability. Safety research could also consider risks that may arise when embedding frontier models within agentic AI frameworks, significantly contributing to the trust and safe adoption of powerful AI solutions.</p><p>This topic contributes to the EU Frontier AI initiative. The project should establish strong links with the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE), ensuring that its priorities inform the research topics addressed. Activities are expected to involve the European AI research community and attract and retain top AI talent working on frontier models and related areas.</p><p>All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&amp;D community through the AI-on-demand platform.</p><p>The project selected in this topic should link to the resources offered by the AI Factories and the Data Labs. Where relevant, it could also establish links with European companies developing frontier AI models.</p><p>All proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with the European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics (ADRA) and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM(2025)723 Apply AI Strategy</p>"

For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities established in Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, entities established in third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the application[[See the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a> available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf.]]. In any case, the association agreement to the Programme must apply by the time of the signature of the grant agreement.</p><p>For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, may not participate in the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, that their participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high-risk supplier) cannot submit guarantees.[[<sup> </sup>The guarantees shall in particular substantiate that, for the purpose of the action, measures are in place to ensure that: a) control over the applicant legal entity is not exercised in a manner that retrains or restricts its ability to carry out the action and to deliver results, that imposes restrictions concerning its infrastructure, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the purpose of the action, or that undermines its capabilities and standards necessary to carry out the action; b) access by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity to sensitive information relating to the action is prevented; and the employees or other persons involved in the action have a national security clearance issued by an eligible country, where appropriate; c) ownership of the intellectual property arising from, and the results of, the action remain within the recipient during and after completion of the action, are not subject to control or restrictions by non-eligible countries or non-eligible country entity, and are not exported outside the eligible countries, nor is access to them from outside the eligible countries granted, without the approval of the eligible country in which the legal entity is established.]]</p></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Described in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-15-general-annexes_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annex B</a> of the Work Programme General Annexes.</p></div></div><div><h4>4.

Real-time user interactions should be favoured by minimizing latency, increasing responsiveness and naturalness of interactions. The developed technologies will also dynamically respond to users’ inputs and environmental changes.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals will focus on and address the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Asset and scene creation technology evolving in parallel to enable the generation of a human-centric, highly detailed and realistic environments to interact with,</li><li>Use of Generative AI for more personalised and natural experiences,</li><li>Visualisation and interaction through innovative immersive technologies to enhance the user experience through a seamless, inclusive and immersive involvement,</li><li>Full integration and interoperability of XR and immersive domains and applications (including e.g. Digital Twins),</li><li>Integration of XR applications and components with Telco-Cloud-to-Edge Continuum components, addressing challenges related to resource availability and reliability, while also balancing the requirements of rapid response time, spatial computing, contextual awareness and smart network functions.</li> </ul><p>The proposals should also advance on the development of technological standards, common data formats and protocols that would enable real-time, seamless and intuitive user-interaction and exchange of information between different systems and platforms in the future, as stepping stones towards Web 4.0.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Proposals will include demonstrators of the developed technologies in real-world scenarios, illustrating the usefulness and efficiency of emerging technologies in Virtual Worlds in illustrative scenarios in the industrial and societal contexts, exploiting the Telco-Cloud-to-Edge Continuum and the 3C pilots on converged Telco Edge Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate future synergies, provisions for future collaboration, and complementarity with other relevant actions carried out under call HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-08: Demand-side 3C pilot demonstrators on converged Telco Edge Cloud Infrastructure. We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately.

To keep this momentum and advancing further, new generation of XR equipment, wearable solutions and haptic components, as well as non-invasive brain computer interfaces for handsfree interaction, hardware or technologies will put the users at the very centre of virtual experiences, for even greater and realistic immersion, aiming at blurring the lines between the real and digital environments. To ensure this next generation of engaging and lifelike immersion, all senses must be stimulated (sight, hearing, feel, touch, smell), for a fully immersive close-to-reality experience. Users will be submerged with realistic sensations making the experience as immersive as possible.</p><p>Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or push the limit of existing ones to improve the synchronization and integration of the different modalities.</p><p>Proposals will integrate various components in fully tested devices, demonstrating the usefulness and efficiency of their system in illustrative scenarios in the industrial and societal contexts.</p><p>Proposals should focus on performant, reliable, miniaturised, interoperable advanced and innovative technologies, with inclusivity, energy consumption and energy efficiency at the centre of concerns.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>The Consortium should pay attention to developing solutions that are reliable, robust and interoperable. Proposals should leverage existing open standards and technologies in the domain of Virtual Worlds, while contributing to ongoing standardisation work.</p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The co-programmed European Partnership for Virtual Worlds will help to develop and promote a thriving industrial and end-user ecosystem in the EU, covering all the aspects of the virtual worlds value chain. It will also actively engage with industrial and societal sectors to provide access to a broad range of resources, including funding, expertise and technology.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Review and, if necessary, update the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) for Virtual Worlds in Europe, for useful, open, interoperable, inclusive, sustainable and trustworthy virtual worlds systems and applications, ensuring these reflect EU values and principles.</li><li>Strengthening of the European Virtual Worlds Partnership by providing continuous support.</li><li>Reinforcement of the competitive ecosystem, with European companies playing a leading role in the adoption and acceptance, and in the development and deployment of Virtual Worlds technologies.</li><li>Reinforced links among initiatives in virtual worlds in Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, and other programmes at EU, national and regional levels.</li><li>Widespread awareness and outreach programmes.</li><li>Increased adoption of virtual worlds that are open, accessible and inclusive, interdisciplinary, safe and respect ethical values and European legal framework, including regarding privacy, security in all Member States and Associated Countries.</li><li>Strengthening and promotion of standardisation methods for virtual worlds technologies and in support of the EU regulatory framework.</li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The objective of the CSA is to further develop and <u>reinforce</u> the community by strengthening and supporting the Virtual Worlds Partnership and its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for Virtual Worlds (SRIA). The CSA will also lay the grounds for a strong and inclusive network bringing together academia, industry, public actors and end-users, including major industrial European sectors and all relevant stakeholders. The CSA will ensure close coordination at regional, national and European level.</p><p>The CSA will also strongly continue to promote the adoption of Virtual Worlds technologies and solutions in all Member States and Associated Countries, with particular emphasis on geographical aspect and across the value chain.</p><p>To this end, the CSA will develop and implement outreach programmes aiming at better understanding and raising awareness to create acceptance and trustworthiness of Virtual Worlds solutions.</p><p>The CSA will also support standardisation efforts to support the uptake of interoperable, open, trustworthy and ethical Virtual Worlds solution, by mobilising and bringing stakeholders together and, when needed, organising European representation in existing or new standardisation working groups in support of the Commission regulatory framework.</p><p>Proposals should involve and be driven by representatives of the relevant actors of the field (e.g., academia, RTOs, industry including SMEs).</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>Proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by key stakeholders in this field and directly support the Virtual Worlds Partnership.</p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>This topic is implemented through the co-programmed European Partnership for Virtual Worlds and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the Partnership on Virtual Worlds and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA: HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-17.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds.</p>"

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

The focus is on key manufactured components and products that are competitive and have enhanced performance, and contribute to Europe’s technological leadership in manufacturing, but which are at risk of being lost to Europe or rely on raw materials or parts whose supply is mostly coming from outside Europe.</p><p>Proposals should develop technologies and machinery to enable the manufacturing of these components with a minimal use of critical raw materials [reference to overall targets] or imported materials. This includes an increased use of secondary raw materials or biobased materials or revalorised components.</p><p>Where appropriate to enhance performance and quality, proposals should target the use of innovative advanced materials (such as lightweight, functionalised or self-healing materials). In this case, the development of the advanced materials should not be the main focus of proposals, nevertheless the necessary steps to adapt such innovative advanced materials to the needs of the manufacturing application should be included. These can include digital twins for materials as well as SSbD-design steps.</p><p>Examples of advanced manufacturing technologies and machinery include, but are not restricted to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovative additive manufacturing;</li><li>Hybrid manufacturing (additive, subtractive);</li><li>Photonics;</li><li>Advanced joining technologies;</li><li>Polymer composite manufacturing;</li><li>Advanced technologies for surface treatment and structuring, to tailor surface properties for specific applications;</li><li>Manufacturing of components with lightweight materials; and</li><li>In-line testing.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>The portfolio approach will be used, to ensure that at least one proposal focusing on the automotive industry is funded. However, <em>the production of batteries is not within the scope of this topic</em>.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Japan or Taiwan.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Made in Europe.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] The production of batteries (including for automotive use) is addressed by topic HORIZON-CL5-2026-05-D2-03: Integrated Production and Product Development for Next-Generation Lithium-based Batteries for Mobility.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

The attainment of this target requires moving away from primary, often expensive, and rare resources, by the re-integration and valorisation of secondary resources (end-of-use waste) and industrial side-streams into the process industries as feedstock. Priority should be given to streams that contain critical and insufficiently available raw materials, and to streams with a large carbon footprint or a large required energy input for their production. </p><p>The development of technologies should encompass the entire value chain from the collection, dismantling, sorting and separation of waste to the processing of the streams and the production of new high-quality materials. The demonstration of the innovative, efficient, and economically viable technologies is required, considering a scale and conditions that can give reliable indications on the real-world economic potential. Minimizing the intake of energy and water should be considered.</p><p>Proposals under this topic are expected to address at least 3 of the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increase the share of sustainable feed streams of the process industries from end-of-use waste and/or foster circular material flows in house and/or across sites of iron-containing and other residuals / waste / by-products, avoiding incineration or disposal, including the development / upscaling of low CO2 processes with reduced negative impact on air quality;</li><li>Improve product designs including by-products for easier re-cycling and upcycling;</li><li>Enhance existing technologies for a more efficient residual / waste / by-products collection, sorting, classification, characterisation, treatment, processing and re-use. This can include development / improvement of end-of-life recycling processes targeting waste, scrap, dust and sludges for possible use for high-performance high-reliability products;</li><li>Recover relevant secondary raw materials, including critical ones, and target maximum process efficiency;</li><li>Reduce the usage of scarce and critical raw materials in the production processes, while at the same time preserving ecosystem and reducing pressures on biodiversity that would be caused by extraction;</li><li>Reduce the number of manufacturing stages by shortening of production processes, leading to a reduction in the energy consumption; and/or consider approaches/technologies for optimising efficiency in terms of water use.</li><li>Understand the effect of specific contaminants on the properties of materials produced from secondary feedstock and develop technologies for their removal if needed, also in view of the need for pre-treatment and secondary manufacturing steps.</li><li>Where relevant, include analytical techniques for micro- and/or nano-characterisation of materials to gain the necessary knowledge to influence processes and allow dedicated modelling. </li> </ul><p>Showcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale. Digitalisation should be included when effective, but it must not be targeted independently from the development and validation of the necessary process technologies.</p><p>The re-integration of side streams in the production cycle can take place within one sector or across sectors (industrial symbiosis). Impacts of regulations must be considered and proposals for their modification and/or enhancement should be suggested where required.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Processes4Planet and Clean Steel.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/02/05/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-ratings-council-and-parliament-reach-agreement/\">Environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings: Council and Parliament reach agreement - Consilium</a></p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Proposals should develop new innovative advanced materials (IAMs) with superior or novel functionalities designed for circularity. The scope includes necessary developments of related processes and technologies to ensure integration in industrial manufacturing facilitating uptake of the developed solutions. Proposals should also develop circular business models considering the cost of changes needed along the life cycle of these new materials to facilitate their uptake.</p><p>The scope covers the full innovation cycle from the design for circularity and functional integration (new materials designs), development and scaleup (including scalable recovery, recycling and valorisation at end of life), to demonstration of industrial uptake and integration into products. The transformative potential of the developed solutions is to be showcased by demonstrators and industrial use cases. Projects should also explore possibilities to transfer developed solutions to other applications or sectors.</p><p>The SSbD framework<sup>[1]</sup> should guide the innovation process towards safer and more sustainable chemicals and advanced materials. Where relevant data generated within the proposal may be shared with the Common Data Platform for Chemicals. The new alternatives to be developed should meet the technical functions required in the specific applications while aligning their innovation process decision making with such framework.</p><p>Best use of digital tools and FAIR data, including AI and data-driven approaches throughout the innovation process should support the circular transition for industry and circular product design. This includes sharing FAIR and interoperable data and tools across supply networks and value chains, to foster circularity, including data needed for materials and component development, production and circular product design. Proposals should adhere to the FAIR data principles and adopt wherever relevant, data standards and data sharing/access good practices.</p><p>The approach should foster collaboration among stakeholders along the innovation chain and industrial value networks to accelerate the development and adoption of new circular solutions.</p><p>Projects should build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, in particular with the Materials Commons for Europe.</p><p>Proposals should support strategic value chains in the fields of mobility and medical devices. The portfolio approach will be used to fund at least one proposal from each of these two areas. Proposers should declare in their proposal the main application area of their proposal (i.e. mobility or medical devices).</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU) and Made in Europe (MiE).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>See documents defining the SSbD framework and criteria on: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en</a></p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

In order to strengthen EU autonomy and reduce over-dependency, we must boost domestic sourcing, both for primary and secondary raw materials.</p><p>Actions should be based on a common understanding of relevant terms and codes, and develop an understanding of anthropogenic resources and derive the needed aspects for classification of recovery projects and to develop criteria for a transparent, consistent and objective classification, needed to establish a comprehensive resource classification approach.</p><p>Projects should also include the biodiversity footprint of primary and secondary raw materials in the expected reports and foresights, using natural capital accounting frameworks.</p><p>Actions should acquire new data on secondary raw materials via in situ sampling from different regions across the EU, collect existing data and present in a harmonised UNFC format. The monitoring should focus on countries where the waste goes into European recycling industrial ecosystems. However, the monitoring must cover the statistics of wastes exported from Europe as well as waste flows between Member States. The action could build on and advance further the work of UNECE – UNFC expert group on Anthropogenic resources regarding the classification of secondary raw materials and the work of Horizon Europe project FUTURAM regarding collection of data and information on secondary raw materials. Projects could build on the knowledge and models from projects funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-15, as well as the UN WCMC natural capital accounting frameworks.<sup>[1]</sup> The action should develop a proposal for EU statistics for secondary raw materials.</p><p>The action should focus on the following streams of secondary raw materials, with particular attention to critical raw materials: waste batteries, WEEE, mining waste, slags and ashes, and construction and demolition waste. The action should also anticipate the evolution of WEEE directive.</p><p>All the data and information generated through these actions should be shared in open formats on a free of charge basis with the European Commission, for its own use and for publication.</p><p>The action should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged with countries with which the EU has signed Strategic Partnerships on raw materials, especially with Ukraine.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/natural-capital</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/raw-materials-diplomacy_en\">https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/raw-materials-diplomacy_en</a></p>"

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

This can be achieved with novel tools or proofs of concept using digital methods to accelerate development of new materials and demonstration of their properties. Where possible this should explore collaboration with other initiatives such as the Materials Commons for Europe or DIGIPASS, contributing data, modelling, digital tools applicable to the design, development, production, manufacturing, use and end of life phases, which connect to repeatable workflows. These workflows and tools may include the use of artificial intelligence as well as self-driving labs and their interconnection and design of experiment/design of simulation methods. They should also drive innovation in risk assessment, new test methods and support and facilitate the operationalisation and use of the SSbD framework<sup>[1]</sup>. Projects should include demonstrators which help to validate the materials development in realistic conditions.</p><p>By doing so, new innovative advanced materials (IAMs) with superior or novel functionalities and alternatives to substances of concern should be developed more rapidly in Europe. In addition, digital feedback loops ranging from requirements and information from production processes and scale-up, to manufacturing and integration into products, should be developed to accelerate market uptake. Innovative digital tools to speed up risk assessment and thereby market access of chemicals and advanced materials may also be addressed.</p><p>Interoperable workflows based on shared standards and dedicated ontologies, in particular through collaboration with the Materials Commons for Europe, should help to reduce the cost of the digital transition for industry with respect to circularity and safe and sustainable by design, e.g. by reducing the risk for adopters and vendors, and through modular tools that can be extended to new application domains without a major redesign. Tools should foster workflows in that ensure high-quality, well-structured and documented primary FAIR data and FAIR digital tools and workflows, enabling the re-use and/or streamlining of large data sets, facilitating academic and industrial collaborations and integrating AI and other digital technologies. Synergies with the SSbD toolboxes can also be foreseen including the adaptation and validation<sup>[2]</sup> of the test methods for advanced materials. Proposals could also facilitate the generation of relevant data and where relevant sharing of data with the Common Data Platform for Chemicals. Where relevant, proposals should actively contribute to and cooperate with the EU Innovation and Substitution Hub(s). Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to the proposed activities.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of added value to the operationalisation of the SSbD framework.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>See documents defining the SSbD framework on: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In this context, validation refers to the requirement that test methods included in any SSbD toolbox must be sufficiently reliable and robust for innovators to use them.</p><p></p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Cooperation with Japan in the field of innovative advanced materials is strengthened. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Advanced materials are an important factor for the competitiveness of Japanese and European industries and are a crucial building block for strengthening resilience and open strategic autonomy, including through international collaboration. Against this background, the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy, have in April 2024 announced the launch of the EU-Japan Enhanced Dialogue<sup>[1]</sup> on Advanced Materials. This builds on the success of EU-Japan collaboration in R&amp;I in material sciences. It aims to create a platform for sharing information on policy developments and exploring the opportunities to pursue collaborative research in the areas of mutual interest.</p><p>As part of the EU-Japan Enhanced Dialogue on Advanced Materials and taking into account the Communication on Advanced Materials for Industrial Leadership<sup>[2]</sup>, the purpose of this action is to enable European researchers in innovative advanced materials from Member States and Associated Countries to make research visits to related Japanese institutions. Proposals should aim to provide travel grants strengthening collaboration in relevant ongoing research activities in Europe on the topic of advanced materials with applications to either mobility, energy, construction, electronics or medical devices. Proposals should ensure a wide geographical coverage of the grants in Member States and Associated Countries. They should aim at visits to research groups at Japanese organisations with complementary activities for up to one month duration. Such travel grants should build on collaborations with Japanese organisations that are willing to receive such a visits. Proposals can either support the initiation of new collaborations, or existing collaborations.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/japan/eu-and-japan-launch-enhanced-dialogue-advanced-materials_en?s=169</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1121</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Achieve a significant reduction in the production costs of CO2-based products, making them competitive with conventionally produced alternatives. This involves optimising the integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion processes.</li><li>Demonstrate processes that minimize energy consumption during the entire conversion process, leveraging advances in process integration that can shift equilibria and the use of renewable electricity and available heat sources.</li><li>Contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions by enabling the sustainable use of CO2, supporting circular economy principles through the valorisation of CO2, possibly aligned with CCS.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>There are only a few products that can be competitively produced from CO2. Increased opportunities for CCU from process industry emissions require the development of a larger portfolio of potential CO2-derived products. The higher cost of CO2-based products compared to conventional production routes is mostly driven by the high energy demand arising from the thermodynamic constraints of CO2. The smart integration of CO2 capture, purification and conversion can enable process optimisation with reduced energy consumption as well as reduced capital expenditure. Additionally, innovative processes can overcome the inherent equilibrium limitations of CCU production. The development of new integrated processes can be an opportunity to optimise the use of electricity, make use of available heat sources and relevant infrastructures and thus accelerate the development of CO2 valorisation.</p><p>Proposals under this topic are expected to address several of the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for the smart integration of CO2 capture, purification, and conversion, focusing on reducing energy demand, capital expenditure and possible integration with CCS infrastructure requirements.</li><li>Incorporate renewable energy sources (including the fluctuation of energy availability) and innovative energy management strategies to enhance the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the CO2 valorisation processes.</li><li>Identify and integrate available heat sources and existing infrastructures to enhance process efficiency and reduce operational costs.</li><li>Address the constraints related to CO2 conversion processes, employing innovative approaches to maximize yield and process efficiency, for example by overcoming low equilibrium yields.</li><li>Conduct comprehensive lifecycle and economic assessments to ensure that the proposed solutions are viable, sustainable, and economically attractive.</li> </ul><p>Conversion of CO2 to methanol and fuels is considered outside the scope of this topic.</p><p>Showcase improved performance, scalability and cost efficiency of the proposed solution through at least one case at laboratory level pilot scale.</p><p>The inclusion of a <strong>GHG avoidance methodology</strong><sup>[1]</sup><strong> is recommended</strong> and should provide detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. Proposals should consider representative real industrial sites demonstrating the solutions at least in open-loop computations. This should be done in parallel to the actual operation of the plants with validation of the benefits by simulations with accurate models. Experiments involving real industrial sites are encouraged. Societal- and environmental impact as well as implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European partnership Processes4Planet.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>That could follow Innovation Fund methodology: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf</a></p>"

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Proposals are expected to develop and provide schemes to attract management talent (including but not limited to organisational sciences) to technology infrastructures in EU member states. These management talent schemes should be aimed at attracting talents that will study the technology infrastructures needs, in terms of competencies, skills, organizations, and business models, to deliver more efficiently their services to industry, especially to SMEs, startups and scaleups. Based on this sound understanding of Technology Infrastructures needs, the attracted management talents are expected to both develop and provide advice to Technology Infrastructures senior management and trainings to their staff members aimed at increasing their capacity to develop and provide services to industry. The developed trainings should be sector-agnostic, open-source, accessible remotely, easy to update, and take stock of other existing similar initiatives and experiences in Research and Technology Infrastructures.</p><p>Proposals should propose ways to enhance skills and career profiles of technical staff working in technology infrastructures to address evolving needs such as research security, data management, quality assurance, etc., as well as further professionalising the training of managerial and leadership staff in technology infrastructures. They should help also to promote entrepreneurial skills for technology infrastructures staff in training curricula to fully capture the potential of technology infrastructures as centres of deep-tech innovation ecosystem.</p><p>Furthermore, proposals should aim to enhance transnational and multisite collaboration among Technology Infrastructures fostering the building of technology infrastructures ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, and best practices in management and capacity building, staff exchange and networking. These collaborations could lay the foundations of a future framework to facilitate coordination of technology infrastructures policy and priority setting at EU level as well as exchange of experience and good practices. Proposals may also benefit, especially for communication and dissemination activities, from sharing best practices and taking stock of what other relevant projects are developing in the field of Technology Infrastructures. Existing specific best management practices and European frameworks in the technology fields considered by the proposals have to be taken into account.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Access mechanisms to Technology Infrastructures as well as access contracts and collaboration or service provision agreements are often complex, while the costs of using such infrastructures can significantly surpass the financial capacities of growing innovative companies.</p><p>The action will develop and test pilot multi-site access schemes for startups, scaleups and other innovative SMEs, involving a critical mass of Technology Infrastructures operators and users in priority areas (including but not limited to advanced materials, clean energy, or health and biotechnology). It should build on existing initiatives with already developed single access points to a comprehensive set of facilities and services in a selected technology area, like for example Open Innovation Test Beds or other integrated networks, that allow for a quick deployment of a common access scheme.</p><p>The action should include setting-up a pilot centrally managed and funded access programme, allowing companies quick access to the needed services, with simplified and standardised access conditions applicable across the EU, to be coordinated and in line with the work on the envisaged European Charter of access for industrial users to research and technology infrastructures. While the focus shall be the provision of access and support services to companies, the action can also include enhancing the accessibility and usability of technology infrastructure services to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of users.</p><p>The action should aim at significant broadening of the user base of the technology infrastructures to address the needs of startups and scaleups that do not have access to such facilities in their local ecosystems. To this end, proposals should include the development and implementation of activities to increase the visibility and promote and demonstrate the uptake of technology infrastructures services provided to users across the EU.</p><p>Furthermore, proposals should aim to enhance transnational and multisite collaboration among Technology Infrastructures fostering the building of technology infrastructures ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, and best practices in management, service offer, staff exchange and networking. Proposals may also benefit, especially for communication and dissemination activities, from sharing best practices and taking stock of what other relevant projects are developing in the field of Technology Infrastructures.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Information about the available services is limited, especially on infrastructures located beyond their local ecosystems.</p><p>Proposals are expected to create an inventory of existing and ongoing mapping of technology infrastructure and technology infrastructure services in Europe and to consolidate the knowledge into an interactive portal that will serve as technology infrastructure service finder.</p><p>Furthermore, based on this inventory and other existing evidence-gathering and policy analysis, the proposals should use a comprehensive taxonomy of the technology infrastructures landscape. The portal, in line with regional smart specializations and existing ecosystems, should help assess which new technology infrastructure needs to be built to ensure long-term Europe’s competitiveness and sovereignty. </p><p>Proposals should set out to establish an interactive portal including an interactive finder for technology infrastructure services in the EU. The finder should be aligned with other ongoing activities such as EIB TechEU, EIB Advisory services and other relevant tools identified during the inventory stage. The interactive finder should facilitate the cooperation between technology infrastructure operators with industry (including SMEs, startups and scaleups) and other relevant stakeholders and propose services from a demand driven perspective. It should lead to increased opportunities for startups and scaleups for development, testing, up-scaling and deployment of new technologies.</p><p>The developed platform should be based on open-sources technologies, allowing interoperability with parallel initiatives and self-sustainability on long-term, and propose a suitable opensource application interface (API) or develop an open-source API that will allow flow of information between technology infrastructure service providers. The CSA could support the maintenance of the platform for at least 5 years.</p><p>Proposals should include also communication actions aimed at increasing the visibility and uptake of the finder and of technology infrastructures across the EU as well as activities to facilitate dialogue and networking among stakeholders. This should include promoting the uptake of the platform. </p><p>Furthermore, the proposal should develop a model to make the platform self-sustainable on the long-term, through, but not only limited to, proper governance, financing and other relevant aspects.</p><p>Proposals should also aim at enhancing transnational and multisite collaboration among Technology Infrastructures and their users, fostering the building of technology infrastructures ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, best practices service development and service offer, feedback from users, staff exchange and networking. Proposals may also benefit, especially for communication and dissemination activities, from sharing best practices and taking stock of what other relevant projects are developing in the field of Technology Infrastructures.</p>"

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+).

IAM-enabled multifunctional surfaces able to detect and respond to changes in the environment, such as temperature, pH, moisture, microbiological or chemical pollutants, concentration of chemical species in air, gases and liquids, and converting these signals into measurable outputs. Such surfaces should demonstrate high performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, response time, durability and cost-effectiveness. Proposals should target applications such as environmental and ecosystems monitoring, as well as health monitoring.</p><p>B. The development of enhanced IAM-based sensor demonstrators, that enable miniaturization and integration into application systems e.g. into portable IoT devices, lightweight wearables and wearable systems. These sensors must meet key performance requirements, e.g. compatibility with silicon technology, operation in real conditions with low power consumption, high sensitivity (low limit of detection and/or high signal to noise ratio), high selectivity and fast detection speed.</p><p>Stability and resistance to extreme conditions such temperature and humidity should be taken into account. Solutions could also take inspiration from bio-mimicry.</p><p>Proposals may contribute to one or both above R&amp;I areas. However the main area addressed must be clearly and unambiguously identified in the proposed project.</p><p>Proposals should integrate the value chain and incorporate the relevant manufacturing technologies needed to bring the developed devices towards the market.</p><p>Technology must be demonstrated in an industrially relevant environment.</p><p>Proposals should include activities aiming at facilitating future exploitation of results.</p><p>Consideration of circularity and recyclability, and compliance with the safe and sustainable by design framework should boost the confidence of industry and end-users and enhance the Innovative Advanced Materials ecosystem and uptake.</p><p>Where relevant, cooperation with activities funded under the Chips Joint Undertaking, the photonics partnership or other initiatives are encouraged.</p><p>Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority (i.e. DG-CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU).</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

The focus is on key manufactured components and products that are competitive and have enhanced performance, and contribute to Europe’s technological leadership in manufacturing, but which are at risk of being lost to Europe or rely on raw materials or parts whose supply is mostly coming from outside Europe.</p><p>Proposals should develop technologies and machinery to enable the manufacturing of these components with a minimal use of critical raw materials [reference to overall targets] or imported materials. This includes an increased use of secondary raw materials or biobased materials or revalorised components.</p><p>Where appropriate to enhance performance and quality, proposals should target the use of innovative advanced materials (such as lightweight, functionalised or self-healing materials). In this case, the development of the advanced materials should not be the main focus of proposals, nevertheless the necessary steps to adapt such innovative advanced materials to the needs of the manufacturing application should be included. These can include digital twins for materials as well as SSbD-design steps.</p><p>Examples of advanced manufacturing technologies and machinery include, but are not restricted to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovative additive manufacturing;</li><li>Hybrid manufacturing (additive, subtractive);</li><li>Photonics;</li><li>Advanced joining technologies;</li><li>Polymer composite manufacturing; </li><li>Advanced technologies for surface treatment and structuring, to tailor surface properties for specific applications;</li><li>Manufacturing of components with lightweight materials; and</li><li>In-line testing. </li> </ul><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. </p><p>Applications in the automotive industry may be considered. However, <em>the production of batteries is not within the scope of this topic</em>.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Japan or Taiwan.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Made in Europe.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] The production of batteries (including for automotive use) is addressed by topic HORIZON-CL5-2026-05-D2-03: Integrated Production and Product Development for Next-Generation Lithium-based Batteries for Mobility.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects.

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Proposals should develop new innovative advanced materials (IAMs) with superior or novel functionalities designed for circularity. The scope includes necessary developments of related processes and technologies to ensure integration in industrial manufacturing facilitating uptake of the developed solutions. Proposals should also develop circular business models considering the cost of changes needed along the life cycle of these new materials to facilitate their uptake.</p><p>The scope covers the full innovation cycle from the design for circularity and functional integration (new materials designs), development and scaleup (including scalable recovery, recycling and valorisation at end of life), to demonstration of industrial uptake and integration into products. The transformative potential of the developed solutions is to be showcased by demonstrators and industrial use cases. Projects should also explore possibilities to transfer developed solutions to other applications or sectors. </p><p>The SSbD framework<sup>[1]</sup> should guide the innovation process towards safer and more sustainable chemicals and advanced materials. Where relevant data generated within the proposal may be shared with the Common Data Platform for Chemicals. The new alternatives to be developed should meet the technical functions required in the specific applications while aligning their innovation process decision making with such framework.</p><p>Best use of digital tools and FAIR data, including AI and data-driven approaches throughout the innovation process should support the circular transition for industry and circular product design. This includes sharing FAIR and interoperable data and tools across supply networks and value chains, to foster circularity, including data needed for materials and component development, production and circular product design.</p><p>The approach should foster collaboration among stakeholders along the innovation chain and industrial value networks to accelerate the development and adoption of new circular solutions.</p><p>Projects should build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, in particular with the Materials Commons for Europe. </p><p>Proposals should support strategic value chains in the fields of energy and construction. The portfolio approach will be used to fund at least one proposal from each of these two. Proposers should declare in their proposal the main application area of their proposal (i.e., energy or construction).</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU (IAM4EU) and Made in Europe (MiE).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>See documents defining the SSbD framework and criteria on: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en</a></p>"

Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

To allow for the scale up of the use of innovative renewable materials and sustainable chemicals by the textile industry, improved processability of materials, suitable processing technology, deeper technical knowledge and smart phase-in approaches such as material blending or drop-in solutions are required. Specific emphasis must be placed on resulting final product quality, their durability and functionality to avoid negative user/consumer perception of products made with renewable materials and sustainable chemicals. As not all cost and quality challenges may be immediately overcome by technological innovation, accompanying business models and systems approaches are needed to enable equitable cost and risk sharing among all involved stakeholders in the textile value chain.</p><p>Attributes such as recyclability, recycled material content, and resource efficiency as well as reduced carbon and environmental footprint are expected to be part of the textile-specific requirements under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation.</p><p>Proposals should specifically address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovative processing technologies to facilitate the efficient use of recycled, regenerated and bio-based fibres as well as sustainable processing and functionalising chemicals across all major stages of the textile manufacturing value chain, such as spinning, weaving, knitting, dyeing or finishing;</li><li>Quantification of biodiversity outcomes associated to new processes by using existing Monitoring, Reporting and Validation (MRV) methodologies, adapting and testing them if needed;</li><li>Characterisation, quality assurance and mitigation strategies for the most common processing and functionality challenges and limitations of the sustainable materials and chemicals targeted;</li><li>Development of best practices and training materials targeted at designers, manufacturers, brands, end of life managers and end users, working with the targeted materials and chemicals;</li><li>Strategies and tools to practically implement collective risk sharing and smart scaling approaches.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should actively involve suppliers of renewable materials and sustainable chemicals, brands, commercial end users and developers/manufacturers of relevant processing technology and industrial partners with the capacity to commercially scale up production with the targeted materials and chemicals. The involvement of partners beyond the manufacturing supply chain, such as product designers, brands, commercial end users and end of life managers including collectors, sorters, recyclers and remanufacturers is particularly encouraged. Proposals should carry out research and innovation to develop missing elements and achieve the necessary integration, including economic viability. Hence, synergies with, or using results from, other projects may be appropriate. <em>The mere integration of existing technologies or processes is outside the scope of this topic</em>.</p><p>Proposals should provide between 10% and 25% of the EU contribution through financial support to third parties (FSTP), in order to maximise the number of SMEs involved in small-scale innovation projects. FSTP funding can be provided only to SME participants, while the active participation of larger companies in such innovation projects in encouraged. The involvement of start-ups is also specifically encouraged.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Textiles for the Future.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased recovery rates of valuable raw materials, particularly critical raw materials from low grade or complex ores and/or from mining waste;</li><li>Increased economic performance in terms of higher material-, water-, energy- and cost-efficiency and flexibility in minerals processing and metallurgical processes; and</li><li>Improved health, safety and environmental performance of the operations throughout the whole life cycle that is considered, including a reduction in waste, wastewater and generation of emissions of air pollutants and a better recovery of resources from generated waste, reducing the environmental footprint and contributing to biodiversity and ecosystems preservation. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Actions should develop and validate / demonstrate pilot scale facility located in the EU integrating relevant processing and refining technologies for improved recovery of raw materials from low grade and/or complex ores from extractive wastes, reduction of waste and water and air pollution, higher energy efficiency and reduction of land and sea-use change, habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. The action can also focus on reducing the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting material products. The actions should target minerals and metals, particularly critical raw materials.</p><p>The solution proposed should be flexible enough to adapt to different or variable ore grades and extractive waste streams and should be supported by efficient and robust process control. Where relevant, any solution proposed for the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials should also include the appropriate management of the hazardous substances removed.</p><p>Actions should develop intelligent and innovative production systems which better utilise natural resources by minimising losses during waste-rock separation in an optimised and energy-efficient process and by minimising use of water.</p><p>Recycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this topic.</p><p>Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.</p><p>Actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant. The action should also include the analysis of financial opportunities ensuring the market exploitation and replication of the circular business model behind the developed solutions as new processes, products and/or services. The industry based in the EU, and users of recovered secondary raw materials should assume prominent role in the proposed actions, supported by adequate allocation of resources.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. For TRLs 6-7, a credible strategy to achieve full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the commitments of the leading partners after the end of the project.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged with countries with which the EU has signed Strategic Partnerships on raw materials, especially with Ukraine.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/raw-materials-diplomacy_en\">https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/raw-materials-diplomacy_en</a></p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Flexibility in screening additional raw materials will be an added value.</p><p>The consortium should build the EU expert community covering each screened raw material with expertise on primary and secondary resources; production, including exploration, mining, processing, recycling and refining; substitution of critical raw materials; raw materials markets; future demand and supply; supply risk management and stress tests; materials flows; raw materials standardisation; environmental footprint, socio-economic analysis, and strategic value chains and end-use sectors, including batteries, e-mobility, renewable energy, electronics, security and aerospace.</p><p>The actions should contribute to the EU policy making related to critical raw materials, in particular to the implementation of the Critical Raw Materials Act, including the development of the new list of critical raw materials and their specific applications or sectors. The action is expected to coordinate with the Commission regarding the events and reflect the EU policy planning.</p><p>The actions should also improve data and knowledge on all screened raw materials and the analysis of the future supply and demand of raw materials, their environmental footprint, technology gaps and innovation potential along the raw materials value chains.</p><p>The action should update the data and information fact sheets from the previous criticality exercise for all screened raw materials, and ensure their quality by relevant raw material experts. Factsheets are to be finalised by the end of 2029, and could be fine-tuned before publication expected in 2030.</p><p>The action is expected to organise two expert validation workshops in 2029 to support the EU criticality assessment, and validate draft factsheets for all screened materials. In coordination with the Commission, organise in-depth workshops on several strategic metals for renewable energy, e-mobility and aero-space and security / dual use, with recognised commodity experts from industry and other organisations.</p><p>The data and information produced by the action shall be shared with the Commission at free of charge basis.</p><p>The action should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.</p>"

The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced valorisation of intellectual assets, including dormant patents, from universities and public research organisations to support the adoption of green and digital technologies by industry, SMEs and start-ups/spinoffs.</li><li>Development of entrepreneurial skills and increased involvement of students, researchers, and innovators in the valorisation of research results.</li><li>Uptake of effective models and tools to facilitate valorisation of unused IP and intellectual assets and access by startups, SMEs, and innovative companies to this untapped knowledge in public research organisations. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Aligned with the European Union's policy priorities, this action will contribute to overcoming the innovation paradox by maximising the impact of public spending in R&amp;I through improved knowledge valorisation practices, and facilitating the uptake of green and digital technologies by start-ups, spinoffs, and innovative SMEs. By unlocking the untapped potential of intellectual assets within universities and public research organisations, and leveraging the creativity of students, researchers, and innovators, the action seeks to improve value creation opportunities deriving from these assets and bolster the competitiveness of European industry. </p><p>The action should explore strategies and implement pilots for actively involving students and researchers (including those in social sciences and humanities) in valorising academic IP and intellectual assets. These should include hackathons, workshops and larger-scale “summer camp” programmes, and foresee the involvement of interested industry partners than can be potential adopters.</p><p>The action should also identify and test models and tools for easier IP access and utilisation by startups and SMEs. These should cover innovative licensing and other valorisation approaches, especially tackling the issue of unused academic patents, as well as the use of AI to manage and valorise research results and IP.</p><p> Proposals submitted under this topic should consider how to exploit synergies with other EU-funded projects covering intellectual assets management, entrepreneurship, and AI for knowledge valorisation. They should also pay particular attention to reducing the gender gap and promoting diversity in knowledge valorisation, and include dedicated measures to foster gender balance and inclusiveness in this field.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Access mechanisms to Technology Infrastructures as well as access contracts and collaboration or service provision agreements are often complex, while the costs of using such infrastructures can significantly surpass the financial capacities of growing innovative companies.</p><p>The action will develop and test pilot multi-site access schemes for startups, scaleups and other innovative SMEs, involving a critical mass of Technology Infrastructures operators and users in priority areas (including but not limited to advanced materials, clean energy, or health and biotechnology). It should build on existing initiatives with already developed single access points to a comprehensive set of facilities and services in a selected technology area, like for example Open Innovation Test Beds or other integrated networks, that allow for a quick deployment of a common access scheme.</p><p>The action should include setting-up a pilot centrally managed and funded access programme, allowing companies quick access to the needed services, with simplified and standardised access conditions applicable across the EU, to be coordinated and in line with the work on the envisaged European Charter of access for industrial users to research and technology infrastructures. While the focus shall be the provision of access and support services to companies, the action can also include enhancing the accessibility and usability of technology infrastructure services to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of users.</p><p>The action should aim at significant broadening of the user base of the technology infrastructures to address the needs of startups and scaleups that do not have access to such facilities in their local ecosystems. To this end, proposals should include the development and implementation of activities to increase the visibility and promote and demonstrate the uptake of technology infrastructures services provided to users across the EU.</p><p>Furthermore, proposals should aim to enhance transnational and multisite collaboration among Technology Infrastructures fostering the building of technology infrastructures ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, and best practices in management, service offer, staff exchange and networking. Proposals may also benefit, especially for communication and dissemination activities, from sharing best practices and taking stock of what other relevant projects are developing in the field of Technology Infrastructures.</p>"

            "<p>This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the <strong>twin green and digital transition</strong>, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of <strong>chemicals, advanced materials</strong> and <strong>critical raw materials</strong>.</p><p>The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&amp;I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025;</li><li>Critical Raw Materials Act;</li><li>Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026;</li><li>Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025;</li><li>European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025;</li><li>Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and</li><li>Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge.</li> </ul><p>In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials.</p><p>The new approach takes into account R&amp;I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones.</p><p>In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal <strong>Clean Industrial Deal Call</strong>, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&amp;I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness.</p><p>In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the <strong>circular economy</strong> as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes</p><p>This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>Finally, to support <strong>start-ups and scale-ups</strong>, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation</strong>:</p><p>This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a <em>business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation</em>.</p><p>A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved.</p><p>The <em>business case</em> should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage.</p><p>The <em>exploitation strategy</em> should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance.</p><p>For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, in the context of <strong>skills</strong>, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries.</p><p>Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.</p><p>For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) will be called upon to cooperate with the relevant parts of the<strong> Joint Research Centre (JRC)</strong>, in order to inform the next stages of EU technology and innovation policies.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>INnovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) (<a href=\"https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/\">https://innovation-centre-for-industrial-transformation.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li><li>The Energy and Industry Geography Lab: EIGL (<a href=\"https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://energy-industry-geolab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</a>).</li> </ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>A significant decarbonisation of processes (measured by the reduction of GHG emissions from the overall system) with broad applicability and economic viability.</li><li>Facilitation of the transition from fossil-based energy inputs for:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>low/medium thermal energy demands by introducing renewable-based alternatives and heat upgrading. </li><li>High-temperature processes, by innovative technologies for electrified and hybrid high-temperature processes, high temperature energy storage.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Clean energy usage is given a boost through innovative advanced materials, system concepts and technologies for energy integration and energy storage, supporting resilience against energy supply variations</li><li>Combination of significant energy savings and integrated management of energy systems and production processes</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Most processes in the process industries require significant energy inputs which currently lead to substantial CO2 emissions by the process industries. The reduction of the CO2 footprint can be achieved by several measures, e.g. electrification or use of other renewable sources of energy, lowering of the energy demand, increasing energy efficiency, and energy integration. This topic aims to lead to significant steps in reducing the CO2 footprint by technological innovations, at least by 20%.</p><p>A key problem in the use of renewable energy sources is their fluctuation over time. Projects should take this into account and develop solutions that aim for energy efficiency and include novel storage technologies of relevance to the process industries. Pure demand-side management by production schedules adapted to the supply of electricity from renewable sources is not within the scope of the call.</p><p>In situations where full electrification is not feasible or competitive in the foreseeable future, sustainable hybrid solutions play a crucial role. These solutions enhance flexibility, allowing industries to manage the variability in the availability of affordable renewable electricity, which is expected to fluctuate significantly in the medium term. E.g., preheating processes can utilize fossil-free energy sources such as solar heat, geothermal heat, heat pumps, resistive or induction heating, and electric boilers. This initial stage can be followed by further heating using fossil-based methods initially, and later transitioning to renewable-based combustion processes to achieve the required process temperatures.</p><p>To enhance resilience, the capture, storage, and management of energy flows should be tailored to the needs of the process industry. This may include research and innovation in safe and sustainable innovative advanced materials for (latent or sensible) energy storage, e.g. phase change materials and heat storage via chemical energy carriers beyond E-fuels.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should address several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advancements in the use of energy from renewable sources in production processes with improved energy efficiency.</li><li>Integrated energy systems with novel storage elements to enable a smooth operation of the plants despite variations in the availability of energy from renewable sources.</li><li>Solutions for low/medium temperature (100 - 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive industries including hybrid solutions and a progressive reduction of the use of fossil carriers of energy.</li><li>Solutions for high temperature (&gt; 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive industries, including high temperature electricity driven processes, and high temperature energy storage.</li><li>Application of high-performance insulation materials and new innovative advanced materials that can improve heat capture, storage, and retrieval, particularly for scalable high-temperature applications. Such materials should minimize the use of critical raw material, enabling effective recycling.</li> </ul><p>Projects should include demonstrations at pilot scale, preferably in real industrial environments, to validate the proposed technologies and processes under real-world industrial conditions</p><p>Proposals related to innovative advanced materials development should address the most relevant gaps to focus on in the frame from materials design to technology deployment and ensure adequate feedback loops between different steps to drive forward innovative solutions which can be easily deployed. Scalability and requirements from application/industry need to be considered early on in the innovation process.</p><p>The inclusion of a <strong>GHG avoidance methodology</strong><sup>[1]</sup><strong> is recommended</strong> and should provide detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. As project output an elaborated exploitation plan should be developed, including preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation and deployment (feasibility study, business plan and financial model) indicating possible private and public funding sources (e.g. Innovation Fund, InvestEU and cohesion policy funds). Societal- and environmental impact as well as implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European partnerships Processes4Planet and Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>That could follow Innovation Fund methodology: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>A significant decarbonisation of processes (measured by the reduction of GHG emissions from the overall system) with broad applicability and economic viability.</li><li>Facilitation of the transition from fossil-based energy inputs for:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>low/medium thermal energy demands by introducing renewable-based alternatives and heat upgrading. </li><li>High-temperature processes, by innovative technologies for electrified and hybrid high-temperature processes, high temperature energy storage.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Clean energy usage is given a boost through innovative advanced materials, system concepts and technologies for energy integration and energy storage, supporting resilience against energy supply variations</li><li>Combination of significant energy savings and integrated management of energy systems and production processes</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Most processes in the process industries require significant energy inputs which currently lead to substantial CO2 emissions by the process industries. The reduction of the CO2 footprint can be achieved by several measures, e.g. electrification or use of other renewable sources of energy, lowering of the energy demand, increasing energy efficiency, and energy integration. This topic aims to lead to significant steps in reducing the CO2 footprint by technological innovations, at least by 20%.</p><p>A key problem in the use of renewable energy sources is their fluctuation over time. Projects should take this into account and develop solutions that aim for energy efficiency and include novel storage technologies of relevance to the process industries. Pure demand-side management by production schedules adapted to the supply of electricity from renewable sources is not within the scope of the call.</p><p>In situations where full electrification is not feasible or competitive in the foreseeable future, sustainable hybrid solutions play a crucial role. These solutions enhance flexibility, allowing industries to manage the variability in the availability of affordable renewable electricity, which is expected to fluctuate significantly in the medium term. E.g., preheating processes can utilize fossil-free energy sources such as solar heat, geothermal heat, heat pumps, resistive or induction heating, and electric boilers. This initial stage can be followed by further heating using fossil-based methods initially, and later transitioning to renewable-based combustion processes to achieve the required process temperatures.</p><p>To enhance resilience, the capture, storage, and management of energy flows should be tailored to the needs of the process industry. This may include research and innovation in safe and sustainable innovative advanced materials for (latent or sensible) energy storage, e.g. phase change materials and heat storage via chemical energy carriers beyond E-fuels.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should address several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advancements in the use of energy from renewable sources in production processes with improved energy efficiency.</li><li>Integrated energy systems with novel storage elements to enable a smooth operation of the plants despite variations in the availability of energy from renewable sources.</li><li>Solutions for low/medium temperature (100 - 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive industries including hybrid solutions and a progressive reduction of the use of fossil carriers of energy.</li><li>Solutions for high temperature (&gt; 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive industries, including high temperature electricity driven processes, and high temperature energy storage.</li><li>Application of high-performance insulation materials and new innovative advanced materials that can improve heat capture, storage, and retrieval, particularly for scalable high-temperature applications. Such materials should minimize the use of critical raw material, enabling effective recycling.</li> </ul><p>Projects should include demonstrations at pilot scale, preferably in real industrial environments, to validate the proposed technologies and processes under real-world industrial conditions</p><p>Proposals related to innovative advanced materials development should address the most relevant gaps to focus on in the frame from materials design to technology deployment and ensure adequate feedback loops between different steps to drive forward innovative solutions which can be easily deployed. Scalability and requirements from application/industry need to be considered early on in the innovation process.</p><p>The inclusion of a <strong>GHG avoidance methodology</strong><sup>[1]</sup><strong> is recommended</strong> and should provide detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction.</p><p>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. As project output an elaborated exploitation plan should be developed, including preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation and deployment (feasibility study, business plan and financial model) indicating possible private and public funding sources (e.g. Innovation Fund, InvestEU and cohesion policy funds). Societal- and environmental impact as well as implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European partnerships Processes4Planet and Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>That could follow Innovation Fund methodology: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/innovfund/wp-call/2021/call-annex_c_innovfund-lsc-2021_en.pdf</a></p>"
