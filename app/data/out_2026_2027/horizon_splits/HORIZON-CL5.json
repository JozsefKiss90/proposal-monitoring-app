Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.</p><p>Moreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.</p><p>The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework<sup>[1]</sup> set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SO<sub>x</sub> emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM<sup>[3]</sup>, as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions.</p><p>Limited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future.</p><p>Assessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N<sub>2</sub>O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted.</p><p>In addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place.</p><p>With CH<sub>4</sub> being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel.</p><p>New fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH<sub>3)</sub>, methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, as well as dual-fuel engines and CO<sub>2</sub> capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO<sub>2</sub> is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced.</p><p>Demonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>To address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&amp;I activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N<sub>2</sub>O, UFP, NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4,, </sub>PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data;</li><li>Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports;</li><li>Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated;</li><li>Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area;</li><li>Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals;</li><li>Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates;</li><li>Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged;</li><li>Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations;</li><li>Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels;</li><li>Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation;</li><li>Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels;</li><li>Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles. </li> </ul><p>Proposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, major port cities and coastal areas in the EU.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on “Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities should be avoided.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial. </p><p>The funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects selected under the topic of the EU Ocean &amp; Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and ship source pollution policies. </p><p>This topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040. Measures include the adoption of lower-carbon fuels such as methanol and ammonia. In the EU, initiatives like FuelEU Maritime and ETS inclusion will drive this transition while regulations address harmful emissions like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, with Tier III NOx limits enforced. Discussions also focus on Black Carbon emissions in the Arctic and health impacts of ultrafine particles.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>For example, evidence shows that the introduced Tiers may not be effective in controlling NOx emissions in real vessel operation, scrubbers may result in the formation of new ultra-fine particles, ammonia combustion potentially leads to the formation of nitrous oxide and ammonia slip, methanol combustion may lead to the production of formaldehyde, LNG may result in the slip of methane, etc. Obviously, any strategy targeting the control of GHG or air pollutants should not result in negative side-effects such as the release of harmful pollutants which are today not covered by regulations.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>CH4 – methane; NOx - nitrogen oxides; N20 – nitrous oxide; UFP – ultra-fine particles; BC – black carbon; PM – particulate matter.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased percentage of Heavy Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (HD-BEV) tested and used in operations by the logistics and transport operators involved in the demonstrations, compared to the current fleets.</li><li>Demonstrated efficient integration of HD-BEV in logistics fleets and operations along several European corridor segments, building further on the initial fleet developed in the large-scale demonstrations and across several types of transport operators.</li><li>Reinforced ecosystem connecting involved parties as fleet operators, charge providers, road authorities at local, regional, national and European levels – also reinforcing the industrial HD-BEV value chain in the EU. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The implementation of zero emission vehicles for long-distance heavy-duty freight transport is of key importance to meet the European targets reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. To further accelerate HD-BEV integration in logistic fleets and operations it is essential to identify and address the remaining barriers and challenges of their deployment. These barriers can be related to e.g. limitations in vehicle technology, digital tools, knowledge and user awareness, stakeholder engagement, energy and power availability, charging infrastructure needs such as depot charging and Megawatt Charging System (MCS), permit processes and connection to the grid and services. The challenges for logistics companies’ (also smaller operators) implementing zero emission transport solutions need to be addressed.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Perform large-scale demonstrations of HD BEV equipped with MCS reaching up to a hundred market-ready vehicles and new generation vehicles in logistics fleets operations, involving several transport operators also engaging SMEs and microenterprises, focussing on long-haul operation (average ≥600km operations) during extended durations of over twelve months. The demonstrations must cover at least four European corridors’ segments in at least four Member States (MS) and/or Associated Countries (AC), and involved HD BEV should where possible be also equipped with MCS connector.</li><li>Identify and address the barriers and challenges to accelerate the deployment of fleets of HD-BEV in long-distance logistics operations in Europe, considering also the impact of battery degradation and the weather conditions in all seasons.</li><li>Develop and integrate in the demonstrations the use of digital tools with use of AI, access to data sets, operational and governance logistics models including charging opportunities and models to facilitate increasing numbers of HD-BEVs in logistics operations</li><li>Ensure synergies with the existing publicly accessible charging infrastructure available or funded under the CEF and/or other national/regional funding schemes and assess charging methods and business models for long-haul operations such as depot, destination, truck-stops, overnight etc., using different charging power considering cost and time optimisation. Only depot charging (mono and/or multi-operator) infrastructure can be (partially) funded in demonstration projects, including related innovative business models associated such as smart, bidirectional V2X solutions and possible second life of batteries.</li><li>Develop a competition-compliant ecosystem for sharing data for HD-BEV fleet management in so-called data labs including data pooling, which can include publication of open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data, and which could build on the common European mobility data space, also supporting the dissemination best practices, learnings and capacity building mechanisms as levers for HD-BEV acceleration. Using the shared data, new services and tools can be developed, including AI-based tools, agents and model frameworks for fleet management, both for on-board and remote monitoring.</li><li>Define and test use cases for the use of HD-BEV fleets in long-distance logistics operations for cross-border flows, operational strategies to shift freight transport demand to zero-emission solutions, and collaborative business model(s).</li><li>Establish synergies and leverage with previous and ongoing projects related to HD-BEV and charging systems and with related forums, platforms and programmes, such as with the European Clean Corridors Initiative, as part of the Automotive Action Plan.<sup>[1]</sup></li><li>Map and assess how policies and relevant legislation (including incentives) can support an affordable transition to HD-BEV. Identify and address, by providing recommendations, remaining legal and regulatory barriers encountered in the demonstrations.</li> </ul><p>An analysis of the potential economic, social and environmental benefits (notably greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions reduction) must be included in the demonstrations.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>e.g.: <a href=\"https://www.2zeroemission.eu/research-projects/\">Research projects - 2Zero Emission</a>; <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/clean-transport/sustainable-transport-forum-stf_en\">Sustainable Transport Forum (STF) - European Commission</a>, “European Clean Transport Corridor initiative” – Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector (COM(2025) 95 final).</p>"

The potential to further leverage these developments with Software Defined Vehicle solutions (e.g. high-level functionality ranging from energy efficiency and performance improvements to personalizing the driving experience) over the lifetime of the vehicle needs to be explored. This would bring together developers working at the embedded system level with those working on high-level functions also to ensure that novel solutions will conform with homologation requirements. Solutions coming from this project must also be compatible with current automotive standards, esp. regarding external infrastructure. Compatibility e.g. with EVSE regarding ISO 15118-20 must be ensured.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects, where possible building upon available open-source building blocks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Investigate the potential of novel propulsion and chassis system/sub-systems packaging and performance from a holistic EV architecture perspective and for fast charging, significantly improving the current State-of-Art performance via digital solutions and leveraging AI when beneficial.</li><li>Include chassis and traction hardware solutions as well as standardised control and physical interfaces to improve innovation speed and software solutions, also leveraging the potential of open source.</li><li>Develop a system architecture to ensure optimal compatibility with the high-level SW and the physical powertrain and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems (e.g. mechanical, electro-mechanical, etc.) with appropriate SW tooling for efficient SDV development, integration and validation, e.g. operational functionality, also including driving range improvement according to user expectations. Target applications are expected to be fit for mass-market M1 C-segment vehicle or below.</li><li>Identify required software interfaces (Application Programming Interface and/or software services), i.e. especially which kind of information/data are required for an energy-efficient in the context of powertrain, chassis, automated driving and vehicle SW/interfaces needed for vehicle-to-grid functionalities, considering the vehicle and environment.</li><li>Develop solutions that minimize energy use while meeting users’ expectations, such as battery management, predictive maintenance, or eco-efficient routing and driving systems, leveraging AI-driven workflows when beneficial. When using AI-based approaches, projects are expected to ensure that the use AI in electric vehicles does not increase the overall energy need.</li><li>Ensure the consistency of data and information from different sources and different market players to ensure the scaling potential of solutions (i.e. in-vehicle interfaces as part of the Vehicle Signal Specification, e.g. COVESA, Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle).<sup>[2]</sup></li><li>Propose recommendations on possible test protocols for future implementation and safety ratings.</li><li>Collaborate with the Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative under the Chips JU<sup>[3]</sup> by adopting relevant existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework. Ensure close coordination with the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European Automotive Action Plan.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Also see an example blueprint of a SDV in: <a href=\"https://federate-sdv.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-12-SDVoF-Vision-document-ver017-final.pdf\">https://federate-sdv.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-12-SDVoF-Vision-document-ver017-final.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://covesa.global/\">COVESA, the Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance</a>; <a href=\"https://sdv.eclipse.org/\">Software Defined Vehicle | The Eclipse Foundation</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.chips-ju.europa.eu/Projects/\">Projects Chips Ju</a></p>"

Ensured increased adoption of sustainable waterborne transport practices in ports of all sizes. </li><li>Sustainable and digital strategies will prepare middle and small-sized ports to enhance their competitiveness with a focus on cost-effective and scalable adaptation measures, increase their climate resilience and biodiversity friendliness, and improve safety for port workers and crews of ships at berth.</li><li>Sustainable and digital strategies will reduce emissions of GHG, air and water pollutants and other biodiversity impacts from ports, applying innovative solutions for zero-emission and biodiversity friendly port operations and ships at berth. Strategies should be applicable to maritime and inland waterway middle-sized and small-sized ports and located throughout Europe.</li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the EU Port Strategy.</li><li>Development of sustainable and digital strategies that not only enhance the competitiveness of middle-sized and small-sized ports but also mitigate health risks for populations in port areas. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Ports are important multimodal hubs in the supply chain, linking the sea with the hinterland, evolving into critical hubs and facilitators of sustainable energies, are clusters of industry and circular economy, as well as geo-political and geo-economic resilience. Europe needs ports that are competitive and sustainable on local, regional and global levels, and the Competitiveness Compass calls for a new strategy to highlight the role that European ports will play in the future EU economy.</p><p>The Green Deal aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 <u>and to reverse the degradation of ecosystems by 2030</u>. The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> (SSMS) states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change, less biodiversity harmful and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that ports can provide increasing volumes of clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, and on a modernised grid.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Identify innovative technologies, as well as results from EU-funded research, innovation and deployment projects and other technological, economic and social best practices. Consider mature technologies ready to be deployed in middle and small-sized ports across the EU contributing to the expected outcomes. Address challenges and opportunities for the implementation and/or for commercial deployment of these solutions in small and medium-sized maritime ports and inland waterway ports located throughout the EU.</li><li>Developing strategies contributing to the expected outcomes for middle and small ports across the EU following a geographical balance, contributing to the objectives of the EU Ports Strategy.</li><li>Design and demonstrate integrated smart energy systems and grids for port and waterborne transport operations, including energy production, storage and OPS operations, covering the needs for electrification and charging of port terminal equipment, and modes of transport connecting the port to the hinterland, such road transport, nearby industry and buildings) to make the solutions more energy- and cost-effective.</li><li>Develop climate resilience strategies of middle and small size ports and their infrastructure, including adaptation measures to address sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related risks, with a focus on cost-effective and scalable solutions (such as nature-based solutions), building on best practices developed in EU-funded research projects.</li><li>Analyse how VTMIS and port community systems can be developed and exploited to their full potential, harmonizing functionalities whenever possible, paving the way to automatic shipping. Consider possible linkages to eMSW and eFTI.</li><li>Apply digital standards and common semantics which enable the harmonisation of collection and analysis of GHG and pollutant emissions at small and medium sized TEN-T ports network.</li><li>When developing digital solutions proposals should consider cybersecurity implications and develop solutions that assess and manage vulnerabilities in IT and OT systems, establish robust incident response plans, implement strong access control measures, network and supply chain security, in line with EU standards such as the NIS Directive and the Cybersecurity Act and with the goal of achieving resilience and redundancy.</li><li>Explore long-term workforce requirements for zero-emission, climate-resilient, biodiversity friendly, safe and competitive port operations, ensuring continuous knowledge transfer between universities, vocational training providers and industry.</li><li>Develop a R&amp;I roadmap for solutions of EU and EEA ports to address the areas covered under the expected outcomes, taking into consideration 2035 as an intermediate milestone and 2050 as the final one.</li><li>Explore, with competent authorities and stakeholders, how environmental aspects related to zero pollution and circular economy for ports as well as maritime and inland waterway vessels can be improved in an environmentally and economically sustainable way (through reception facilities, degassing facilities, OPS...), in line with the ambition expressed in i.a. NAIADES III, SUMPs, local or regional Air Quality Plans and Waste Management Plans. Collaborate with industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to align project outcomes with EU policy objectives, particularly the Port Strategy.</li><li>Explore cooperation between ports, as well as stronger horizontal networking, to increase the efficiency of undertakings and improve the integration of European ports.</li><li>Evaluate the financial implications of proposed solutions and identify possible strategies and tools for financing/funding as well as business models that go beyond request of public support.</li> </ol><p>Solutions at project level must be demonstrated in at least six medium and small-sized TEN-T ports ensuring a geographical balance, of which five are maritime ports and one inland. Not all solution must necessarily be demonstrated in all ports.</p><p>Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/be22d311-4a07-4c29-8b72-d6d255846069_en?filename=2021-mobility-strategy-and-action-plan.pdf\">https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/be22d311-4a07-4c29-8b72-d6d255846069_en?filename=2021-mobility-strategy-and-action-plan.pdf</a></p>"

The MARI-4YARD project together with RESURGAM, FIBRE4YARDS, SMARTYards and PENELOPE developed several solutions on materials, processes, AI and skills. Additionally, the project SEUS in Horizon Europe is developing an integrated software platform with the ambition to save time in engineering, assembly and construction at European shipyards. However, there is still a need to increase the ambition and demonstrate these solutions in medium and small-size shipyards.</p><p><u>At the same time, shipyards are often located in sensitive natural areas, such as coastal regions and estuaries. This provides an opportunity for shipyards to evaluate and reduce their impact on the surrounding biodiversity.</u></p><p>The topic aims to improve efficiency and sustainability of European ship newbuilding and retrofitting processes, to improve the use of resources and circularity, to develop necessary skills and improve working conditions. This requires considering all relevant innovations such as robotics, automation, digitalization and AI in the context of shipbuilding to enhance EU/EEA -focused value chains. The purpose is to increase the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding sector with a view to further replicating and utilizing results, including in potential applications to the Innovation Fund.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Deployment and integration of innovative technologies and systems in small and medium-size EU and EEA shipyards to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of newbuild, repair and retrofit processes and process chains.</li><li>Pilot applications should consider all aspects of the shipbuilding process (including technological, business-related and organizational aspects), equipment, and ship design, potentially including: a) automation and robotics in shipbuilding processes; b) advanced digitalization in design and production; c) innovations in retrofitting and predictive maintenance of shipbuilding assets; circular economy in all relevant processes (construction, repairs, retrofitting and dismantling).</li><li>Pilot applications should also consider systems interoperability and integration with existing shipyard infrastructure, tools and equipment.</li><li>Explore advanced ways of digital collaboration (co-simulation, sharing digital data) while considering cyber security, to improve synergies within value chains, including equipment manufacturers, shipyards, ship designers and shipowners.</li><li>Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies in real life shipyard ecosystem and as much as possible in relation with full scale ship building, including benchmarking of existing practices and consideration of environmental impacts and potential safety improvements for workers. Demonstrations should take place in at least three EU/EEA shipyards.</li><li>Develop biodiversity friendly strategies, integrating nature-based solutions on site, promoting circularity and sustainability of processes.</li><li>Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant.</li><li>Propose measures to solidify the current strengths of smaller and medium-sized shipyards across Europe, with a focus on increasing competitiveness and growth, reinforcing and growing European shipyards and improving environmental performance.</li><li>For exploitation purposes, proposals should: a) develop business plans and rollout strategies, including measures to reduce knowledge and technology leakage outside of Europe; b) identify clear target groups (vessel types, segments and processes) and their current state, deficiencies and improvement needs, and make a clear exploitation strategy on how to roll out the results to end-users. </li> </ol><p>Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

However, this shift poses new safety challenges, particularly in port areas where multiple bunkering operations, import/export terminals, and fuel handling and storage activities coexist. The close location of most ports to cities and inhabited areas raises issues of safety on two fronts: the space deficit due to the difficulty of enlarging the port areas in these locations, (leading to e.g. the storage of various fuels in close proximity), and the broader danger to these inhabited areas due to their proximity to the ports and by extension the storage of these fuels. To ensure a safe and efficient energy transition, it is crucial to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in port areas. As not all ports will be able to store every type of clean fuel in the port or neighbouring area, safety of transport and distribution within the port area (including anchorage) should also be analysed.</p><p>Existing EU legislation regarding specifically the safety of port workers is limited. The <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02001L0096-20081211\">Directive on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (2001/96/EC)</a> sets out the EU requirements which increase safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid cargo in EU ports. Further instruments such as the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02009L0016-20191221\">Directive on port State control (2009/16/EC)</a> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02009L0018-20241226\">Directive on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector (2009/18/EC, recently amended)</a>, while related to safety in the maritime sector, do not apply to the safety of port workers specifically. Broader instruments such as the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A31989L0391\">EU Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive</a> (89/391/EEC) and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/104/oj/eng\">Directive on the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for the Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work (2009/104/EC)</a>, while applicable to port workers due to their general character, miss the intricacies needed to address the specific risks of workers in this sector. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that port workers are being exposed to new risks due to the rising use of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in the maritime sector and the need for safe bunkering and storage of these fuels in port areas.</p><p>Given the above it is important to have a clear picture of the current status regarding the storage and bunkering of fuels across EU ports, identify existing and applicable legislation, map gaps and potential risks and make appropriate recommendations for follow-up actions.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Conduct a comprehensive review of the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels within (inland and sea) the port areas, including distribution, simultaneous bunkering operations, import/export terminals, handling and storage of fuels. </li><li>Analyse gaps in existing regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the safe handling and storage of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, in maritime and inland TEN-T ports.</li><li>Identify safety risks not adequately addressed by current rules and risk assessments, including Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) taking into account - inter-alia - gas dispersion, fire/explosion impacts and their probabilities using F-N curves.</li><li>Develop guidelines and recommendations to ensure safe operations (considering environmental and health aspects) per fuel type in port areas, considering varying port sizes, services (including technical-nautical vessels), locations, and geographies, especially for ports located in populated areas including establishing safety zones. International rules, standards and guidelines should be taken into consideration (especially from the IMO and the IHPA where relevant). Relevant environmental Plans required by EU or national legislation such as Air Quality Plans should be considered. </li><li>Develop standard risk assessment criteria for groups of ports with similar characteristics, operational and weather conditions by researching and establishing standard criteria for risk assessments in port planning and development. This includes defining safety-by-design procedures for new port infrastructures and bunkering operations.</li><li>Engage with relevant stakeholders, including port authorities, terminal operators, shipping companies, trade unions and regulatory bodies, to ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the developed guidelines and recommendations.</li><li>Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. This strategy should include the design and implementation of comprehensive training modules tailored to various roles within port operations, focusing on the specific safety protocols and procedures associated with renewable low and zero-carbon fuels.</li><li>Propose certification and continuous professional development pathways to maintain high safety standards and adapt to evolving technologies and regulations. </li> </ol><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

Relevant improvements should not be considered as part of the at least 25% energy savings target. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Energy consumption of long-distance shipping should be reduced significantly to achieve sustainable worldwide trade. To achieve a more sustainable and environmentally friendly shipping industry, it is essential to continue developing disruptive technologies, advanced materials, and innovative concepts that can significantly reduce energy consumption of long-distance shipping. The objective of this topic is to support solutions for propulsion and non-propulsion energy consumption that aim to achieve at least at least 25% energy savings in long distance shipping as compared to 2008 levels, through the development and integration of standalone solutions. These technologies include (but are not limited to) active or passive increased performance solutions, novel propulsion systems, augmented propulsion technologies capitalizing also on ship motions, hull performance enhancements and the use of advanced materials which can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of vessels. Any fuel-related proposals should only consider renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. These technologies and concepts should be applicable to various types of ships, including ro-pax, container ships, bulk carriers, and tankers.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Development and demonstration at TRL 4-5 of novel, high-uncertainty but high-reward technologies that significantly reduce energy consumption in long distance shipping. </li><li>Development of various ship concepts, conducting replication studies for different case scenarios and modelling the real overall energy savings of the solutions and concepts developed. </li><li>Development of methodologies measuring the impact of the energy efficiency achieved on the GHG intensity and the impact on air pollution of the energy used for propulsion specifically for long distance shipping, with a focus on emission reductions, also facilitating the introduction of such technologies under the scope of LCA guidelines and FuelEU Maritime, and improving the EEDI, EEXI and CII performance where relevant.</li><li>Consider links with digital twin and AI-based optimisation aspects for the considered technologies (e.g., adaptive and model-predictive control), including the necessary sensing systems, to expand the system’s future capacities. </li><li>Model the economic viability of the developed technologies, considering initial investment, operational savings, maintenance costs, and potential financial incentives, to assess the economic feasibility while also facilitating decision-making in the design process.</li><li>Assessment of the safety and environmental implications of the solutions, including technical and operational risks, possible impacts to ships, ports and other land infrastructure. </li><li>Ensure appropriate sustainability of the action outputs by elaborating on a technology development roadmap and by exploring business cases. </li> </ol><p>Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA. </p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p>"

Relevant improvements should not be considered as part of the at least 25% energy savings target. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Energy consumption of long-distance shipping should be reduced significantly to achieve sustainable worldwide trade. To achieve a more sustainable and environmentally friendly shipping industry, it is essential to continue developing disruptive technologies, advanced materials, and innovative concepts that can significantly reduce energy consumption of long-distance shipping. The objective of this topic is to support solutions for propulsion and non-propulsion energy consumption that aim to achieve at least at least 25% energy savings in long distance shipping as compared to 2008 levels, through the development and integration of standalone solutions. These technologies include (but are not limited to) active or passive increased performance solutions, novel propulsion systems, augmented propulsion technologies capitalizing also on ship motions, hull performance enhancements and the use of advanced materials which can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of vessels. Any fuel-related proposals should only consider renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. These technologies and concepts should be applicable to various types of ships, including ro-pax, container ships, bulk carriers, and tankers.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Development and demonstration at TRL 4-5 of novel, high-uncertainty but high-reward technologies that significantly reduce energy consumption in long distance shipping. </li><li>Development of various ship concepts, conducting replication studies for different case scenarios and modelling the real overall energy savings of the solutions and concepts developed. </li><li>Development of methodologies measuring the impact of the energy efficiency achieved on the GHG intensity and the impact on air pollution of the energy used for propulsion specifically for long distance shipping, with a focus on emission reductions, also facilitating the introduction of such technologies under the scope of LCA guidelines and FuelEU Maritime, and improving the EEDI, EEXI and CII performance where relevant.</li><li>Consider links with digital twin and AI-based optimisation aspects for the considered technologies (e.g., adaptive and model-predictive control), including the necessary sensing systems, to expand the system’s future capacities. </li><li>Model the economic viability of the developed technologies, considering initial investment, operational savings, maintenance costs, and potential financial incentives, to assess the economic feasibility while also facilitating decision-making in the design process.</li><li>Assessment of the safety and environmental implications of the solutions, including technical and operational risks, possible impacts to ships, ports and other land infrastructure. </li><li>Ensure appropriate sustainability of the action outputs by elaborating on a technology development roadmap and by exploring business cases. </li> </ol><p>Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to include synergies with shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers, including start-ups and SMEs, located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA. </p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Methods and tools to support measurement, simulation and validation of non-exhaust pollutant emissions in road and railway transport into the environment;</li><li>Estimates on the impact of these pollutants on human health, terrestrial ecosystems and the aquatic environment (including biodiversity in these ecosystems) with particular focus on microplastics and other heavier non-airborne particles;</li><li>Delivery of better emission factors for emission inventories and projections, including the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), also for resuspension, for which little knowledge exists today;</li><li>Recommendations and mitigation strategies including the determination of appropriate KPIs and assessing the effectiveness of control measures with an appropriate cost-benefit analysis to understand the economic and practical feasibility of different emission reduction strategies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>With continuous increase in electrification of the car fleet and railways, the share of non-exhaust particulate emissions into the environment becomes increasingly important. Non-exhaust emissions (NEE) of particles apply to all forms of ground transport and can be categorised as those coming from several sources, such as brake wear, tyre wear, pantograph-catenary wear, wheel-rail contact, road surface wear, as well as vehicle-induced resuspension of road/track dust deposited on the surface. There may be other sources, e.g. engine belts and clutch plates. Quantitative data on the magnitude of non-exhaust emissions are fragmented and highly uncertain, particularly when compared to data for exhaust emissions. Emissions vary widely according to brake, tyre and road surface material, and with driving style. Further research efforts are necessary to increase the understanding of these particles, their creation, ageing and dispersion in the environment.</p><p>Moreover, the health impact of NEEs is far less studied, and it remains unclear whether these predominately solid/non-soluble PM may induce the same effects as combustion PM. Additionally, these pollutants has been reported to adversely affect terrestrial systems and aquatic environment as well as the biodiversity; however, it is not clear to what extent.</p><p>Research into rail particulate emissions is an equally important area due to its implications for air quality, human health, and environmental impact. However, research data on the health impacts of specific particulate components is limited. Furthermore, comprehensive studies on the chemical composition of rail particulates are scarce. The impact of rail particulates on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity is not well understood, while more data is needed on how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas. Addressing these research gaps would provide a more comprehensive understanding of rail particulate emissions and contribute to the development of effective mitigation strategies.</p><p>In order to address the two aforementioned areas (road and rail), R&amp;I actions are expected to address the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Methods and tools for the segregation of NEE particle sources: i) during particle collection (e.g., due to high background concentrations), ii) attribution of collected material to different sources. Appropriate real-world test conditions, equipment and sampling methods for the evaluation of particles (e.g., separation of total and solid particles)</li><li>Source identification and characterization including detailed source apportionment (brake wear, tyre wear, wheel-rail interaction, resuspension, etc.) and chemical composition;</li><li>Assessment of the influencing parameters: use cases (e.g. different vehicle types or tyre types), conditions (e.g. urban, rural, motorways, tunnels), driving behaviour, state of the road surface or rail tracks; attribution and distribution;</li><li>Emission Measurement Techniques including but not limited to standardized measurement methods and real-time monitoring;</li><li>Downstream assessment: analysis of the deposited material in the environment, assessment of its decomposition, aggregation, dispersion and degradation;</li><li>Health Impact estimates building on existing toxicology studies (or developing new ones if deemed necessary) and long-term exposure effects supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis;</li><li>Estimates on the environmental impact on soil, water, and ecosystems and their biodiversity as well as deposition patterns (i.e. how particulates disperse and deposit in different environments, especially in urban versus rural areas.)</li><li>Mitigations through focusing on State-of-the-Art systems: test systems (including the vehicle e.g., vehicle-lightweight technologies) that can mitigate non-exhaust emissions to reach TRL 6 or higher, innovative tyre and brake designs and materials that balance durability, safety, and reduced abrasion, innovative road surfaces and texture (considering the interaction between tyre and road), runoff and drainage systems. For the railway sector mitigation solutions could include test systems addressing emissions from key mechanical interfaces (e.g., braking and wheel–rail contact), vehicle innovations to reduce wear-related emissions, and infrastructure measures such as optimized track materials, surface treatments, and improved drainage and containment systems. Consider life cycle assessment for the analysis of the systems</li><li>Support standardization and regulation based on the recommendations in support of industrial competitiveness</li> </ul><p>Proposals should take into consideration the results of previous or on-going EU funded projects such as <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955387\">Leon-T</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955390\">ULTRAHAS</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://trimis.ec.europa.eu/project/nanoparticle-emissions-transport-sector-health-and-policy-impacts\">nPETS</a> and LIFE23-ENV-ES-LIFE <a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/life/publicWebsite/project/LIFE23-ENV-ES-LIFE-NEEVE-101148428/innovative-technologies-to-monitor-and-reduce-non-exhaust-emissions-particles-and-microplastics-of-vehicles-and-pavements-to-improve-air-quality-and-human-health\">NEEVE</a> and any other similar projects.</p>"

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.</p><p><strong>Scope area A) </strong>Circular economy for Electric Vehicle (EV) powertrains and infrastructure<strong>:</strong></p><p>Improving the circularity of EVs drivetrain components (such as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, gear assemblies and battery components excluding battery cells) and respective charging infrastructure is crucial for resource efficiency, sustainability, and compliance with evolving European regulations. Through durable design, predictive maintenance, refurbishment, etc, it is possible to extend the lifespan of critical components reducing material demand and waste, without jeopardising on the needed performance. Advanced monitoring systems can predict failures, enabling proactive repairs, and to inform improved future design strategies, and potential second life applications. Automated processes coupled with design for dismantling can facilitate efficient component recovery, reducing labour costs and improving material separation for high-value recycling.</p><p>The projects are expected to build on the results of projects funded under <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-04/en\">HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-04</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2022-d5-01-09\">HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-04\">HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-04</a>, as well as to consider the methodologies proposed. They are expected to target at least the same technical performance levels for the electric motor as HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-09 under real-life working conditions, while optimising the design for circularity.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following research activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Component health monitoring for individual components on their RUL (first and subsequent) including assessment of preferred circularity strategy and expected impact on EV affordability. This includes considering the impact of wear patterns, material fatigue, and thermal stress to optimise circularity strategies and extend the lifespan of components.</li><li>Develop novel design concepts and processes to optimise material usage and extend components’ lifetime such as design for (automated) dismantling, in particular to reduce dependency on critical raw materials or enable use of alternatives. </li><li>Promote broader Circular Economy (CE) adoption and increase the potential of reuse, repair and refurbishment by respective design criteria, means of standardisation (assessment and relevant interfaces), usage of RUL monitoring and better understanding of market potential. </li><li>Ensure economic and environmental sustainability in the analysis of drivetrain performance and charging infrastructure (e.g. efficiency, package, user driving experience, CRM use, CE). </li> </ul><p><strong>Scope area B)</strong> Data-driven life-cycle management of Electric Vehicle (EV):</p><p>Vehicle specific data is crucial for advancing circularity through the 9R-strategies in EVs across their lifecycle. However, this data is often not available nor accessible after vehicle production, or not measured in the use phase. Digital passports and track and trace models can improve accessibility to data, enabling predictive maintenance, lifetime extension, and optimised recycling. Harmonised data-sharing policies are essential to ensure interoperability across value chains while maintaining data security and GDPR compliance. Data governance frameworks must regulate ownership, access, and consent to protect privacy and ensure responsible use. The common European data spaces initiative, notably the common European Green Deal data space, and the Data4Energy expert group<sup>[2]</sup> offer a foundation for secure, standardised architectures, ensuring trust and controlled data sharing. Furthermore, efficiency in data collection and storage is also critical. By integrating advanced data strategies, EV manufacturers can unlock new business opportunities and improve efficiency, while complying with regulations.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following research activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for track &amp; trace for representative EV components (e.g. as power electronic converters, rotors, stators of electric motors, or thermal management of the battery system) ensuring access to, at least, the minimum needed data needed ensuring economic viable upscale and especially agreement on how this data can be accessed to enable/improve life-cycle management. The costs and benefits of tracing these data points should also be considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data and data management tools produced in the context of this topic are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</li><li>Development and real-life demonstration of concepts for measuring real-world operational loads (mechanical, electrical, thermal) experienced by the representative EV components complemented by operational and environmental usage of EV that are key for life-cycle management and assessment (LCA).</li><li>Develop and demonstrate in real-life conditions API-based approach to data management of use phase and EoL and open interfaces that enable new business models, allow to better quantify circularity improvements, while allowing its sharing across value chains and supply chains, in a secure and privacy-compliant way.</li><li>Concepts and solutions for product passports based on the use of digital twins (e.g. identification of relevant data points, stakeholders, in connection with existing platforms/passports, such as the battery passport, and platforms e.g. IDIS, IMDS, and Catena-X<sup>[3]</sup>) while also considering LCA aspects. </li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Integration of the results of the demonstrations in regular operation of passenger transport operators, in long distance operations. Accelerated replication of this integration, beyond original demo partners, using specific recommendations and sharing of best practices</li><li>Reliable operation of long distance zero emission buses and coaches in the EU.</li><li>Improved comfort and inter-modality for long distance people mobility services.</li><li>Demonstrated innovative zero emission solutions for long distance people mobility in a holistic approach taking net congestions challenges and charging solutions into account. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Zero emission buses for urban and sub-urban use are successfully implemented in Europe. This has addressed the need to improve air quality, reduce noise and innovate people mobility. Yet there are limitations due to range, vehicle weight and available charging infrastructure to further extend zero emission vehicles in more energy demanding long-distance (ranging from regional, national to transnational) people mobility that needs to be addressed. There is a need to further develop zero-emission solutions where vehicle weight and energy demand are challenges. </p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop sustainable and affordable, long-distance zero emission people mobility solutions for different areas and regions with new and viable business cases based on new operation models and smart management of fleets and of coaches and buses.</li><li>Test and apply concepts, tools and models with direct involvement of European bus/coach providers and operators to speed up deployment. Include the transition from long-distance to urban, in intermodal hubs and with park-and ride.</li><li>Demonstrate using at least 5 coaches and buses in several operational routes in the EU and/or in corridors segments in different Member States and/or Associated Countries, focussing on long-distance operation patterns (average ≥500 km in extra-urban scenarios, in one or more routing).</li><li>Demonstrations must cover aspects such as planning, optimised charging/refuelling schedules, passenger experience, driving time regulations, cross-border trips, charging solutions and impacts on the grid. Replication, recommendations and sharing of best practices shall be part of the demonstrations, as well as the development of new business models and the analysis of remaining legal barriers.</li><li>Develop shared charging solutions that can be used for multiple operators and other vehicle types. Both technical and operational issues must be addressed, as well as “rush hour” at charging stations, balancing demand and supply of energy. The use of charging solutions and shared charging hubs by a variety of mobility and transport operators must be explored, also incorporating seasonal effects and operational demands.</li><li>Based on user needs, develop flexibility in interior design to enhance travel comfort, safety and user experience, thus aiming at making it more appealing and inclusive to use this mode of transport. </li><li>Leverage on other 2Zero projects related to Buses and HDV should be considered.<sup>[1]</sup></li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Ref Examples are projects funded under CL5-2022-D5-01-10 and CL5-2022-D5-01-08</p>"

As electric vehicles become more attractive through Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), significantly higher acquisition costs remain, partly caused by the wide spectrum of usage scenarios and a relatively low number of vehicles, which makes development costs a significant factor for vehicle price.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Simplify system configurations while ensuring energy efficiency for achieving economies of scale and extending component lifespans.</li><li>Increase the voltage (post 800V) to an optimal level with regard to efficiency, affordability, and performance – and especially the compatibility with Megawatt Charging Systems (MCS) – to support faster charging needs and reduction of charging losses within the vehicle by 10 %, while considering the context of modularity and safety.</li><li>Demonstrate the benefits of high-voltage systems also for fast charging and addressing auxiliary components, e.g. thermal management, including the modular interchangeability.</li><li>Consider the possibility of modular and removable battery systems that would favour second-life applications to further enhance sustainability.</li><li>Develop modular powertrain systems to enable tailored solutions for specific use cases, maintain flexibility for broader applications also by developing and defining relevant hardware and software interfaces.</li><li>Demonstrate vehicle solutions in relevant environments to ensure the ability for effective integration with innovative Electrical/Electronic (E/E) architecture and thermal management strategies, or wider solutions.</li><li>Evaluate life-cycle costs against previous lower voltage systems in order to identify potential improvements. </li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

This can include e.g. measures for thermal runaway, fire-resistant systems/materials, easy and safe access to the battery for removal from the vehicle.</li><li>Development of firefighting protocols to deal with EVs on fire in narrow situations, essential for quick and effective intervention, including integration with existing safety standards (e.g., ISO, NFPA) to ensure smooth adoption and compatibility.</li><li>Social awareness for a transparent, informed public perception of the safety level of all EV categories, also with the development of a European based platform for dissemination and information with direct involvement of main stakeholders. </li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

Entire process including design / manufacturing / characterization and testing / certification.</li><li>Sustainable aircraft circular design and manufacturing processes of individual high-value components towards further developing the innovation pipeline from system demonstration to deployment stage in the EU and Associated Countries. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic focuses on:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Additive design and manufacturing of aircraft and engine structural components have already transformed the industry and are expected to be the key to the EU competitiveness. Geopolitical aspects for raw materials reinforce the importance of additive manufacturing, while the European RTOs and industry recognised that there is a substantial untapped potential towards even higher energy efficiency, savings in critical raw materials and higher quality parts. The main objective of this topic is to resolve existing challenges in the AD/AM of metal, high performance/value polymer and composite parts, related to residual stresses, non-equilibrium phase transformations, joining, defects and reproducibility among others.</li><li>Building on previous research efforts (i.e. H2020-SUSTAINair) and EREA’s Future Sky initiatives on circular aviation, proposals should focus to real, challenging and competitive industrial use cases for circular design of individual components, joining technologies, improved maintenance and repair technologies to extend aircraft lifetime and improved recovery of high-quality recycling materials. Especially as regards engines and safety critical systems, real-time condition monitoring and inspection methods have the potential to improve repairability by determining an optimized degradation status, allowing smart repairs on-wing and on-site that reduce or postpone the need for material- and energy-intense overhauls or replacements. </li> </ul>"

To this end, numerous advancements (e.g., electric and hybrid propulsion systems, wind-assisted propulsion technologies, hull optimization, air lubrication systems etc.) have been made across various aspects of ships. However, a high energy-efficient vessel requires addressing specific challenges despite the significant technological advancements. One of the most critical factors relates to the combination and integration of different solutions and measures that may lead to additional energy savings concerning multiple ship elements such as energy conversion, propulsion, onboard energy consumer demands (e.g., hotel loads for passenger vessels, operation equipment for offshore vessels etc.), higher-efficiency conventional or alternative power systems and others without compromising the ship’s safety and performance. </p><p>Adaptability across different ship types and scalability, particularly for large vessels, are further challenges that require meticulous analysis. The shift towards zero emission entails significant investment costs, especially for small and medium-sized shipping companies, and consideration of financial viability is of paramount importance. Lastly, the absence of a concrete standardization framework poses a substantial barrier that must be adequately addressed and overcome. </p><p> Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Full-scale demonstration offering combined reduction of fuel consumption of at least 55% compared to 2008 levels. Proposals should clearly define the baseline, either in case of retrofits or newbuilds, with respect to the ship’s existing or expected operational profile.</li><li>Create a methodology estimating energy savings and reduced GHG intensity and emissions of air pollutants from each technology separately and the aggregated savings of combining these technologies in different scenarios. </li><li>Design optimization to facilitate deployment on different ship types, with a focus on retrofit cases and replication. </li><li>Capitalise on existing digital solutions for including energy optimization (e.g., smart control, energy management) and for seamless integration of technologies with the ship’s automation and class‑certification processes introducing and explore cyber security aspects of the developed solutions.</li><li>Projects should consider how high amounts of data transfers for monitoring, optimization, and decision-making may pose risks in terms of data integrity, cybersecurity and propose approaches to address those risks. </li><li>Assessment of environmental and wider benefits, including reduced emissions of air and water pollutants, and underwater noise, as well as cost-effectiveness of the combined solutions considering life-cycle assessment approaches. </li><li>Focus on safety and operational aspects addressing any technical and operational challenges that may arise from the combination of energy efficiency solutions.</li><li>Facilitate effective cooperation and joint training between vessel crews, ports, and shore-side emergency services to promote safety preparedness, coordinated response strategies, and best practices. </li> </ol><p>Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to prioritise shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers located and/or manufacturing in the EU and EEA. </p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. </p>"

A coordinated effort among various stakeholders including industry partners, research performing organisations, NGOs, the European Commission, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) should help evaluate such prospective potential. It should benefit from the latest Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) results, technical, socio-economic and environment studies, or initiatives being capitalised at EU and international level, to ensure a comprehensive assessment.</p><p>The main objectives are to assess the feasibility, safety, and environmental impact of using nuclear power for shipping to achieve zero-emission of GHG, air and water pollutants in maritime transport. Following a preliminary assessment and literature review, as well as detailed technical and economic studies regulatory and technical recommendations should be developed, along with a review of on-going pilot projects aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of nuclear-powered vessels.</p><p>The project should help evaluate the technical, economic, regulatory, environmental and social aspects of deploying nuclear power in commercial shipping, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and other advanced nuclear technologies.</p><p>Actions should address all the following aspects:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Technical Feasibility: a) To assess the suitability of SMRs and other nuclear technologies for maritime use; b) To evaluate any integration challenges with existing and potential new ship designs, including modular designs.; c) To study the lifecycle of nuclear-powered vessels, including construction, operation, and decommissioning.</li><li>Economic Viability: a) To conduct cost-benefit analyses comparing nuclear-powered shipping to conventional and renewable low and zero-carbon fuel options, taking into account the long-term availability of fuel and the cost of disposal of residues; b) To evaluate infrastructure requirements in the EU, such as port facilities for nuclear vessels; c) Mapping full costs for a nuclear propelled ship on a life cycle basis.</li><li>Safety and Security: a) To develop safety protocols for nuclear-powered ships, including emergency response and accident mitigation; b) To address cybersecurity risks, external threats and proliferation concerns and safety in ports. c) Assessing long-term crew training requirements for nuclear operations, safety and security and their implementation in international training and certification regulations.</li><li>Environmental Impact: a) To analyze the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollutants caused by mining, refining, use and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; b) To assess the impact of nuclear waste management, disposal as part of implementation of a circular economy approach; c) To assess the impact of nuclear-powered ships on marine ecosystems addressing in particular water pollutions and by contaminants; d) To analyze possible damage scenarios with a view to liability issues and mitigation of damages.</li><li>Regulatory and Legal Framework: a) To identify gaps in international maritime law and IAEA nuclear regulations; and b) To propose recommendations related to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)<sup>[2]</sup> and other relevant treaties</li><li>The implications for National Energy and Climate Plans and National Air Pollution Control Programmes required by EU legislative framework.</li><li>Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant.</li> </ol><p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate how their objectives contribute to EU added value and long-term competitiveness in nuclear-powered vessel technologies.

The demonstration should be performed in at least one short-sea shipping vessel.</li><li>Demonstration of two different fully autonomous operation in at least one inland waterway vessel.</li><li>Demonstrations and concept studies should address the whole navigation voyage, including port calling, mooring, and berthing, potential offshore charging solutions, and passing through locks in all weather conditions<sup>[4]</sup>.</li><li>Demonstrations should also include aspects for predictive maintenance, self-diagnostic systems to ensure optimal functioning of the vessel’s equipment and structure</li><li>Identify and address implementation bottlenecks for relevant ship types, such as data quality and lack of infrastructure related to waterborne transport. Map infrastructure and investment needs for extensive roll-out for automated ships operations</li><li>Appropriate steps to ensure sufficient cyber risk management of the systems and infrastructure used when conducting trials<sup>[5]</sup>.</li><li>Address standardization needs and possible safeguards to secure data-integrity and cyber security. Provide recommendations to the relevant regulatory bodies.</li><li>Address the risk of unlawful data transfer to third-countries outside the borders of the EU/EEA and the impacts it could have on EU fleets.</li><li>Integrate ongoing legal processes at EU level and at the IMO related to inland automated vessels and MASS i.e., MASS Code, Search&amp;Rescue and Remote Operating Centres.</li><li>Address safety considerations (using EMSA’s Risk Based Assessment Methodology) and upskilling of port and vessel operators.</li><li>Assess the net carbon impact of autonomous vessels, taking into account the devices and data processing needed to operate them and potential emissions saved, and ensure no significant harm to biodiversity. If applicable, the calculation method to assess the net impact of digital solutions from the European Green Digital Coalition (EGDC) could be used.</li><li>Projects should exceed outcomes of previous or on-going projects in relevant ship types.</li><li>Model the economic viability of the developed solutions, considering initial investment, operational savings, maintenance costs, and potential financial incentives, to assess the economic feasibility while also facilitating decision-making in the design process.

The European Water Resilience Strategy and the European Ocean Pact further emphasize the need to enhance the resilience of European waters to human-induced pressures. Projects like the Horizon Europe EMERGE have researched the impacts of shipping on marine ecosystems. The introduction of technologies to decarbonize the sector may enable, to a certain extent, to phase-out relevant current sources of water and air pollution. However, renewable low and zero-carbon fuels and procedures pose new risks to marine and other aquatic ecosystems like rivers and lakes yet to be explored and addressed, both from the normal function of waterborne transport<sup>[2]</sup> and from accidental spills of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. In addition, other pollution sources can be addressed today<sup>[3]</sup>. This topic aims to evaluate, forecast, control and mitigate the impact of waterborne transport on marine and other aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on developing and demonstrating innovative abatement and mitigation systems and strategies to mitigate and eliminate, where possible, the harmful impact of waterborne transport in the ocean and inland waters. New technologies and solutions addressing the decarbonization of waterborne transport will be considered, as well as the potential risks and challenges associated with these.</p><p>Actions should address all of the following aspects:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Evaluate and forecast the environmental impacts of waterborne transport operations on marine, rivers and other aquatic ecosystems, in particular regarding the effects of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels (with particular attention to accidental spills) and related technologies. The proposal may include testing and experimental work in relation with spills.</li><li>Develop and demonstrate effective response scenarios, including the associated abatement technologies and any potential new innovative equipment, for managing uncontrolled releases of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in marine and inland waters or in port areas, including dedicated specific procedures and operational guidelines.</li><li>Modelling scenarios on water and air pollution sources from each ship types and services running on renewable low and zero carbon fuels.</li><li>Develop and demonstrate innovative and cost-effective abatement and mitigation systems and strategies to prevent, eliminate and reduce the harmful impacts of the use of renewable low and zero carbon fuels. Relevant TRL5 demonstration of such systems should be done.</li><li>Identifying training needs and skills requirements to deploy developed solutions, as well as in relation to the management and use of renewable low carbon fuels in ports and on vessels in marine and inland waters, including relevant emergency response preparedness.</li><li>Develop and demonstrate solutions that improve the resilience of European waters to climate change, pollution, and other human-induced pressures, and contribute to achieving Good Environmental Status and Good Ecological Status in European waters, as well as the objectives of the European Water Resilience Strategy and the European Ocean Pact.</li><li>Strengthen stakeholder engagement by involving environmental, industry and academic associations, to foster inclusive, future-focused environmental responsibility through sustainable practices.</li> </ol><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT).

Aspects like increasing the autonomy range of operation and fast charging are a crucial element for short sea shipping and inland routes with short docking periods. Fast charging may also put added strain on batteries in terms of output and durability. Optimization of the onboard electrical architecture and battery chemistry as well as optimized battery monitoring and management systems and more extensive training of crew can to some extent address this challenge. Life cycle aspects should be considered by design in the integration and operation of vessels, as well as the end-of-life of batteries, making sure that operations can be performed during the whole expected life of the vessel. The topic also explores the need to increase the power capability of fully electric vessels, aiming to define scenarios in which the increase of the peak propulsion power is needed to ensure the safety of operations. Proposals should cover the interface between vessels and port operations addressing the regulatory requirements, including operational procedures. </p><p>Proposals should address all the following aspects: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Full scale demonstration of innovative solutions for extended range and extended battery cycles beyond simple scaling up of existing commercial batteries. Solutions to increase the current operational range of electric vessels to at least 150 nm (or 277.8 KM for inland navigation) for short-sea shipping, ferries, offshore of 400-6500 GT vessels, or 86-135 meters for inland river vessels on free-flowing rivers upstream, allowing rapid in route charging and being applicable to representative operating conditions of the chosen ship. Demonstration of the vessel’s economic viability in normal operation. Demonstrations should also consider baseline reference which are already state of the art</li><li>Identifying the operational profiles and services that require higher energy output for safe and effective operation, developing solutions and modelling scenarios to ensure safe and efficient energy management and navigation taking into account the battery pack and recharging possibilities. </li><li>Incorporating energy-efficiency measures, including but not limited to, efficient AC-DC grid, thermal management, high voltage electrical components, energy management and energy modelling for optimal operation.</li><li>Implementation of vessel‑wide adaptive energy‑management solutions that coordinate battery, propulsion and hotel loads, maximising cycle life while minimising emissions.</li><li>Development of solutions for intelligent and optimized battery management to improve energy efficiency and life extension of the batteries. Furthermore, projects should consider life cycle aspects by design and address the end-of-life of batteries to ensure full electric operation during and beyond the planned operation of the vessel.</li><li>Creating concepts for rapid zero-emission in-route charging, fast charging, offshore charging or battery replenishment, including solutions capable of supplying power to idling vessels anchored offshore near ports, while maintaining desired operating schedules, adhering to current standards.</li><li>Encouraging modular design and ship retrofitting to facilitate replication of the solution, ideally presenting one full retrofit exercise and several replications in similar or different vessels, also including the needs of the OPS infrastructure.</li><li>Development of recommendations and best practices for the safety assessment of the novel installations based on field testing. This should build on established safety guidelines and requirements such as the Guidance on the Safety of Battery Energy Storage Systems onboard ships (from the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA) and the requirements for fixed and swappable batteries on inland vessels (from the European Committee For Drawing Up Standards In The Field Of Inland Navigation – CESNI), as applicable, and contribute to their applicability to a wider scope of novel electrification solutions. Furthermore, recommendations for improving the guidelines and extending them to the demonstrated new battery installation solutions should be presented. Regulatory aspects for the pertinent safety-critical ship systems as well as fire safety solutions for the battery room should also be addressed. In addition, the recommendations should also consider how integration of the safety considerations affects the overall operational planning and economic assessments.</li><li>The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business cases and provide roadmap for the replication and deployment of the proposed technology, including plans for scalability, commercialization, and deployment. Proposals should identify and propose opportunities for further market uptake.</li><li>Establishment of strong collaboration between industry, training providers and higher education institutions to develop specialized courses on enhanced waterborne transport battery management. </li> </ul><p>Proposals must justify the contribution of their objectives, results, intellectual property (IP) management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&amp;I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged to prioritise shipyards, equipment manufacturers and suppliers located in the EU and EEA.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

As such, air quality and noise issues in the vicinity of airports need to be investigated, quantified and addressed. Airports operations can generate water pollution due to their extensive handling of jet fuel and de-icing chemicals, which, if not contained, can contaminate nearby water bodies. Similarly, attention must be given to other possible airport-related environmental impacts associated with noise, water quality, and local ecology in the vicinity of airports.</p><p>In order to address these issues, the following R&amp;I actions should be undertaken:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Comprehensive real time and real-world measurements of pollutant (exhaust and non-exhaust, including resuspension of dust) and noise emissions. The sources of emissions should be differentiated, and the pollutants identified. Operations should include ground operations, landing and take-off (including emissions from tyres and brakes) and assessing exhaust emission during cruising, including impact of changes in flight altitude on engine performance parameters (stationary engine tests). The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated.</li><li>Pilot testing in 2 different airports (possibility as well for testing on other complex transport nodes) for proof of concept with the aim of increasing scalability and replicability for other similar environments. Proposals are expected to select specific airports that are in vicinity of urban/rural communities and close to water streams/bodies, to examine and quantify the effect of airport emissions on air quality, noise and water bodies.</li><li>Investigation of the adverse health and environmental effects (including biodiversity) of particle emissions, NOx, and non-regulated emissions (e.g. black carbon, tyre and brake particles, secondary organic aerosols, etc.) generated from aircraft and airport operations. The analysis should be supported by gender disaggregated data collection and intersectional analysis.</li><li>Estimates of the impact of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit) or GPUs (Ground Power Units) to stationary aircrafts’ emissions (GHG, air pollutants and noise) compared to conventional operation.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should consider the results from previously EU funded projects such as <a href=\"https://trimis.ec.europa.eu/project/assessing-aviation-emission-impact-local-air-quality-airports-towards-regulation\">AVIATOR</a>, <a href=\"https://trimis.ec.europa.eu/project/nanoparticle-emissions-transport-sector-health-and-policy-impacts\">nPETS</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/814978\">TUBE</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/769627\">ANIMA</a> , <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095754\">NEEDED</a> or any other similar projects.</p>"

Underlying elements, in particular climate data records, reanalyses and forcings, are fundamental to climate science and serve multiple applications across weather, climate, environmental and sectoral domains, generating societal benefits. In turn, methods to distil information from this wealth of data can help extract relevant knowledge and key messages for climate policymaking.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:</p><p>A. Next generation climate data records</p><p>Actions should advance innovative methods to enhance, expand and update climate data records; exploit recently rescued and/or new data streams; develop innovative methods to improve the water-energy-carbon cycle physical and bio-geochemical consistency across data records; and improve their applicability for users.</p><p>B. Next generation Earth system reanalyses</p><p>Actions should undertake research to prepare for the next generation global and European high resolution climate reanalyses. Progress is expected in enhanced data assimilation methods, further coupling the Earth system components, expanding atmospheric composition reanalysis backward in time, piloting carbon-energy-water cycle reanalyses, exploring data-driven methods for reanalyses and applying such improvements in subsequent applications and international initiatives.</p><p>C. Next generation climate forcing and emission data sets</p><p>Actions are expected to conduct research to ensure more updated and sustained production, and quality assurance procedures of climate forcings and emissions data sets in support of international climate change assessments and climate simulations, including harmonization between forcing and emission data sets (historical and scenarios).</p><p>Additionally, all actions should promote the development and use of new, rescued or proxy data streams, and innovative digital tools and methods, including AI-based, to transform climate data into actionable knowledge. These efforts should align with, build upon, and support global intercomparison and coordination frameworks such as CMIP, promoting standardisation, accessibility and utility of climate information across climate science and service user communities, with due consideration of FAIR principles.</p><p>Noting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale.</p><p>Research areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public.</p><p>International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP<sup>[2]</sup>, GCOS<sup>[3]</sup>, and IAMC<sup>[4]</sup> is strongly encouraged, as well as close coordination and complementarity with Copernicus, Destination Earth, and other relevant stakeholders.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos/essential-climate-variables/\">GCOS Essential Climate Variables</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\">https://www.wcrp-climate.org/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos\">https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.iamconsortium.org/\">https://www.iamconsortium.org/</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The implementation of the European Adaptation Strategy, European Climate Adaptation Plan, EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change (along with other Green Deal Missions), Preparedness Union Strategy, and national adaptation efforts are informed with the latest scientific evidence and enhanced through tailored decision-support tools.</li><li>Knowledge gaps identified in the EU Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA)<sup>[1]</sup> and latest IPCC assessments are narrowed, including system specific, region specific and cross-cutting gaps, so that the future EUCRAs benefit from a significant reduction of current risk assessment limitations and useful knowledge is available for various policymaking contexts. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States rely on the most accurate and decision-useful assessments of climate risks that science can provide. For this purpose, the new knowledge feeding future EUCRAs will be essential. In the first EUCRA assessment, a number of gaps in terms of knowledge and action, and corresponding recommendations are highlighted to underpin more effective EU policy intervention to manage climate risks, stressing the importance of a systemic approach to climate risk assessments, adaptation and resilience and of the interaction with non-climate risk drivers, such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation among others.</p><p>To support the future EUCRAs and advance adaptation and climate preparedness, actions should improve the understanding and quantification of climate risks, their underlying drivers, and reduce associated uncertainties for different systems and regions. New knowledge should be integrated to assess the risks of wildcards (high impact low probability or black swan events), crossing of tipping points and transboundary, compound and cascading risks in a way that can facilitate decision-making.</p><p>Evidence from recent experiences of materialised climate risks and the performance of adaptation efforts, encompassing the whole range from failure to success and including the role of behavioural aspects, should be mapped and analysed to improve understanding of the key factors that determine effective environmental and social resilience, preparedness and adaptation capacity<sup>[2]</sup>. However, developing context-specific adaptation strategies is out of the scope of this topic.</p><p>The main focus is tackling knowledge gaps identified in the EUCRA. Actions should extend and improve the evidence base by retrieving inputs from relevant end-users, including local and regional authorities, and civil society organisations. While general aspects should cover the whole EU, actions should also improve understanding of sub-European and national to local specific risks. Actions should enhance methodologies and tools for risk assessment, making the outputs available through user-oriented EU portals. For these purposes, proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Address at least two systems or sectors (e.g. ecosystems, agri-food, health, infrastructures, energy, water, economy and finance) that interact and have transboundary effects.</li><li>Include study cases at sub-European scale. While all the cases together should cover the 4 regions defined in EUCRA<sup>[3]</sup>, some of the individual cases should also address the transnational dimension (i.e. include more than one country of the particular region).</li> </ul><p>Actions should contribute to future editions of EUCRA. Specific resources should be devoted to this purpose. Actions should leverage recent advances on other climate risk assessments and related frameworks from reliable sources (e.g. the World Climate Research Programme, WCRP).</p><p>Actions are encouraged to integrate multiple data sources and to leverage digital technologies, such as AI/ML techniques, tools, and models, including those developed under the European Commission’s Destination Earth initiative, if appropriate.</p><p>Coordination and collaboration with relevant projects from Mission Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 on Climate Science and Responses is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national to local scale assessment, methodological consistency, and cross-fertilisation through project scientific boards; with projects from Cluster 3 Destination Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe for knowledge exchange and better integration of end-user perspectives, and from relevant Destinations in other Clusters. Actions are encouraged to make use of the European research infrastructures including Integrated Research Infrastructure Services for Climate Change Risks<sup>[4]</sup>, if appropriate.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment\">https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See for instance the report<u> “</u><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/5bb2881f-9e29-42f2-8b77-8739b19d047c_en?filename=2024_Niinisto-report_Book_VF.pdf\">Safer together: A path towards a fully prepared Union - European Commission</a>”</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Northern, Western, Central-eastern and Southern Europe as considered in the EUCRA report.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://www.iriscc.eu/\">https://www.iriscc.eu/</a></p>"

More clarity is gained on the implications of climate change and climate policies on European competitiveness, economic security and strategic autonomy, with enhanced assessment of opportunities, risks, benefits and costs for the EU economy and citizens.</li><li>Best available evidence and policy recommendations are made available in a timely manner and effectively transferred to inform the Paris Agreement, European Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA), the European Climate Adaptation Plan, the Preparedness Union Strategy, the Clean Industrial Deal, IPCC, IPBES and other initiative.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>As emphasized by the IPCC, it is urgent to better understand the benefits and opportunities associated with deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation action to inform strategic decisions. Comprehensive assessments of the socio-economic impacts of climate change are essential for this, however, current approaches face significant challenges with a wide uncertainty in global damage estimates, fragmentation, lack of comparability across methodologies, and reliance on extrapolation from historical data, increasingly unrealistic in the context of current unprecedented changes in the climate system.</p><p>Actions should develop and enhance models, methods, and tools to improve the understanding of future socio-economic costs of climate inaction (for the purpose of this topic defined as insufficient, or delayed action), advancing novel approaches and frameworks to address the limitations in existing methodologies, integrating latest scientific evidence, diverse data sources and applicable to various conditions and contexts. In this context, actions are encouraged to leverage emerging digital capabilities, including, if appropriate, those developed under initiatives like Destination Earth. Research should account for the full spectrum of climate impacts, such as those from extreme and low-probability high-impact events and the consequences of trespassing Earth system tipping points, to ensure more comprehensive and accurate assessments. Cascading and compound effects as well as non-market impacts (e.g. health, biodiversity and ecosystems, migration) should be considered. Actions should also contribute to rethinking discount rates and damage functions to better reflect the long-term uncertainty of climate impacts and their implications.</p><p>Actions should assess foregone co-benefits and missed opportunities of climate inaction, and their distribution, ranging from health-related gains to economic benefits like business and industrial opportunities, job creation, energy and economic security, innovation and lower costs, as well as environmental and social improvements such as from biodiversity conservation, and reduced inequalities. They should assess increased adaptation needs and costs associated with inadequate mitigation, accelerated climate impacts, lost resilience, crossing of adaptation limits as well as the impact on public budgets<sup>[1]</sup>. To provide the full picture, the cost of climate inaction should be compared with the cost of ambitious mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>Actions should emphasise treatment of uncertainty, ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change. They should explore approaches more compatible with planetary boundaries, going beyond traditional welfare and cost-effectiveness models.</p><p>This topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant SSH disciplines. Actions should include a process of co-design with stakeholders (e.g., representatives of governments, public administrations, such as civil protection competent authorities, or the private sector) to support uptake of the results.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated:</p><p><u>Area A: Global</u></p><p>Analysis should be global in scale, while also providing regionally resolved insights to enable comparisons across world regions, distinguishing between developing and developed, and duly reflecting diverse circumstances and contexts. International cooperation is generally encouraged and specifically required with low and lower/upper-middle-income countries<sup>[2]</sup> – particularly major GHG emitters<sup>[3]</sup> such as China (contributing to the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiative<sup>[4]</sup>), India, Brazil and Indonesia. It should enable delivery of robust, representative and widely accepted estimates, and support scientific capacity building where appropriate.</p><p><u>Area B: The EU</u></p><p>Actions should focus on the EU. Particular attention should be given to consequences for EU industrial performance, security of supply and strategic autonomy.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] For example, the proposals could build upon the joint World Bank and European Commission reports on disaster and climate resilience: <a href=\"https://civil-protection-knowledge-network.europa.eu/disaster-prevention-and-risk-management/economics-disaster-prevention-and-preparedness\">Economics for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <u><u><a href=\"https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lendinggroups\">https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lendinggroups</a></u></u><u>; standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply - only participants from some of these countries are automatically eligible for funding</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgtot#emissions_table</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <u><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/europe-world/international-cooperation/bilateral-cooperation-science-and-technology-agreements-non-eu-countries/china_en#:~:text=In%20line%20with%20the%20ongoing,the%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China.\">International cooperation with China in research and innovation</a></u></p>"

However, effectively communicating both the science and the necessary climate actions remains a significant challenge. Particularly challenging is understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and misinterpretation. There is also a crucial need for a strengthened public trust in science and in democracy, and for evidence-based climate communication strategies that foster a sense of agency through empowering and positive narratives. Complex messages should be made accessible, relevant, and reliable to non-specialist audiences.</p><p>Actions are expected to advance the understanding of the sources, channels, types, and influence of misinformation and disinformation on the public perception and assimilation of climate change-related information. The role of AI should also be investigated. Actions should identify, develop, and test strategies for the public and private sectors to detect, monitor and counteract mis/disinformation about climate and climate policy. Such tools and products should be made available for policymakers, companies and the general public to incentivise and equip society to critically assess climate change-related information online and offline.</p><p>Research is expected to explore how to bridge the gap from climate knowledge and awareness to behavioural change, taking into consideration various factors that shape perceptions across different segments of the society. Actions should generate knowledge and develop innovative, engaging, tailored and multilingual tools, learning techniques, and narratives for impactful climate change communication frameworks at scale. Best-practice examples on European and international level should be retrieved. Climate scientists should be trained to effectively communicate with non-specialist audiences, including policymakers and other stakeholders. Research should investigate how to design and implement targeted communication campaigns that boost climate awareness and preparedness while preventing climate anxiety and counteract disinformation. These campaigns should promote fact-checking, clear and transparent knowledge on climate science and climate policymaking and foster the ability to interpret uncertainties. Citizen engagement, of youth and other vulnerable audiences in particular, is encouraged.</p><p>Actions should develop communication strategies, tools and products tailored to real-world context and societal needs, to counter disinformation and enhance climate communication, leveraging visual and digital tools including AI, as appropriate. They should demonstrate clear pathways for uptake and scaling such as piloting with end-users and integration into existing platforms or frameworks.</p><p>The primary focus of actions should be on Europe, with local and national foci as appropriate, while other regions may be used for framing information. International cooperation is encouraged, especially with the United States<sup>[1]</sup> and low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding <sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>This research requires a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach drawing on insights from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (SSH) including behavioural sciences and gender, media studies, and communication theory. Participation of the private sector, in particular SME, is also strongly encouraged.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe. Collaboration with the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Climate neutral and Smart Cities is recommended when performing empirical work. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply – legal entities from the USA are not automatically eligible for funding.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Please refer to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\">Horizon Europe List of Participating Countries</a> on EU Funding and Tenders Portal for up-to-date information.</p>"

There is reduced reliance on external expertise, increased representation of African science and scientists in international bodies such as the IPCC and UNFCCC, and enhanced African contribution to global climate initiatives such as CMIP, CORDEX and ISIMIP.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Africa is among the regions most severely affected by climate change, mostly due to high vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. While significant advancements in global weather and climate science have transformed resilience efforts elsewhere, their benefits in Africa remain to be harnessed, to unlock the continent’s ability to address climate challenges more effectively.</p><p>Actions should address critical knowledge gaps for improving weather and climate modelling for Africa in the context of changing climate, with focus on the understanding and representation of weather and climate dynamics in Africa at regional, interregional or continental scale. They should enhance models’ predictive skill and reduce uncertainties in key areas such as rainfall and extreme weather events. Actions should harness observational data to advance process-based understanding and model performance across various Earth System components (e.g. land, ocean, atmosphere). This includes improving data collection, assimilation and quality assurance practices, integration of local and rescued historical data to provide high-quality inputs for models. Actions are encouraged to leverage digital technologies, including AI/ML techniques, tools, and models as well as advances in high performance computing to achieve the topic’s goals.</p><p>The research should be performed in close cooperation and co-creation between African and European teams in a way to ensure relevance, acceptance and co-ownership of solutions by African stakeholders. Actions are also expected to contribute to local capacity-building and knowledge exchange to support competence growth and equip African researchers with the data, tools and expertise necessary to sustain future progress. Strong partnerships should be established between relevant institutions in both regions such as universities, research bodies, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and African Regional Climate Centers (RCCs)<sup>[3]</sup> to enable mutual learning and collaborations.</p><p>Synergies and complementarity should be sought with other relevant EU-supported initiatives on climate modelling and capacity development in Africa such as Regional Centres of Excellence related to the green transition<sup>[4]</sup>. Additionally, actions should facilitate access of African researchers to cutting-edge European research infrastructures including supercomputing assets and data repositories to strengthen institutional and regional expertise and capacity.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/resources/team-europe-tracker/partner-countries/sub-saharan-africa/climate-change-adaptation-resilience-africa_en\">Climate Change Adaptation &amp; Resilience - Africa | Capacity4dev</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-climate-change-and-sustainable-energy-ccse_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-climate-change-and-sustainable-energy-ccse_en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://afri-res.uneca.org/pages/africa-regional-climate-centers\">Africa Regional Climate Centers | AFRI-RES</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://africa-knowledge-platform.ec.europa.eu/arcx\">About the Project | Africa Knowledge Platform</a></p>"

International climate policy is informed primarily by the assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the most comprehensive and authoritative evaluation of the state of knowledge on climate science, including the Earth’s climate system and its expected changes under different scenarios. Despite the exponential increase of available data, other evidence and knowledge accumulated on these issues, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of key issues and processes. These may include factors such as insufficient or divergent evidence, low confidence findings or high uncertainties. Some of these gaps are identified in AR6 (specifically, in Working Group I contribution), “The Next Frontier for Climate Change Science”<sup>[1]</sup> and other relevant sources. Moreover, science has progressed since the closing of the evidence base used for AR6, raising new questions and avenues for inquiry.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should seek to narrow the knowledge gaps in the realm of Earth system science (understood here as the scope of Working Group I of the IPCC), offering flexibility for applicants to define the specific research areas targeted. Proposals are expected to focus on issues clearly within the scope of Cluster 5, Destination 1, and not prominently addressed by other topics of the 2025 and 2026-2027 Work Programmes, encouraging new scientific insights and approaches, and the involvement of researchers and entities new to Horizon Europe. Successful proposals are expected to enhance the scientific foundations and inform scientific assessments in a way that ensures they are comprehensive, accurate, and relevant for decision-makers.</p><p>Proposals should clearly identify the knowledge gap(s) they seek to address, substantiate why recent and ongoing research efforts are unlikely to sufficiently address the issue, explain how the proposed action is expected to contribute to the advancement of Earth system science and identify policy relevance of the research proposed.</p><p>International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP<sup>[2]</sup> and GCOS<sup>[3]</sup> is <u>strongly </u>encouraged where relevant.</p><p>Proposals indicating use of satellite remote sensing data and derived products are encouraged to collaborate with projects selected under ESA’s FutureEO programme and the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative (ESSI) to facilitate access to and uptake of satellite data products and related tools or methodologies. They should dedicate resources for collaborative actions.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/72f1cb35-cee7-11ee-b9d9-01aa75ed71a1\">The next frontier for climate change science - Publications Office of the EU</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\">https://www.wcrp-climate.org/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos\">https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results under this topic are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>European battery cell manufacturers are supported in their transition from incumbent (Gen.3) liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery to high performance (solid-state) lithium-ion batteries;</li><li>Increased diversity of chemistries, cell design (application-oriented) of the existing production lines and enabling European Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to stay competitive;</li><li>Scaled production for premium products is targeted in the medium-term (for specific applications such as aviation), and large-scale production is targeted in the longer term. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes <strong>or</strong> lithium metal anodes.</p><p><strong>Process-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades</strong></p><p>Projects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption.</p><p>Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable;</li><li>Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently;</li><li>Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing.</li> </ul><p><strong>Feasibility and Impact Validation</strong></p><p>Projects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency.</p><p>Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments.</p><p><strong>Advanced Materials and Cell Design Integration</strong></p><p>Projects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process.</p><p><strong>Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control</strong></p><p>Projects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste;</li><li>Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants.</li> </ul><p>In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process.</p><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)<sup>[1]</sup> whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu).</p><p>JRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).</p><p>Projects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.</p><p>To strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Shortened development time of battery cells and battery systems by minimising the experimental testing effort, thus reducing the overall costs and the time to market;</li><li>Increased battery reliability and safety through better understanding of ageing, and safety-relevant (deactivation, degradation, failure) mechanisms;</li><li>Acceleration of a more reliable verification and validation of new solutions contributing to increased user acceptability (safety, performance &amp; costs) and competitiveness of the European battery value chain;</li><li>Standardised battery system testing &amp; validation approaches focussing on the combination of physical and virtual test methodologies. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.</p><p>To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).</p><p>Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;</li><li>Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;</li><li>Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;</li><li>Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;</li><li>Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life.</li> </ul><p>Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;</li><li>Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.</li><li>Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort.</li> </ul><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>Proposals are expected to also establish cooperation and complementarity with the selected proposal under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-02-03: “Creating a digital passport to track battery materials, optimise battery performance and life, validate recycling, and promote a new business model based on data sharing (Batt4EU Partnership)” with regards to safety and ageing information as part of the battery passport.</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)<sup>[1]</sup> whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu)</p><p>JRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).</p><p>Projects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.</p><p>To strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en</p>"

Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.</p><p>The instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.</p><p>The action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&amp;I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p>The project selected should address all of the following actions:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Make a consolidated analysis:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the <strong><em>Descriptions of the Actions</em></strong><sup>[4]</sup> of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation.</li><li>of all <strong><em>First reports on Societal Readiness</em></strong> to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the <em>Description of the Actions</em>’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified.

Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&amp;I activities.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>Mid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analyse the various <strong>interdisciplinarity</strong> mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.</li><li>Organise<strong> annual workshops</strong> in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.</li><li>Set up a<strong> public web platform</strong> during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should be updated and completed on a regular basis.</li><li>Eventually provide a set of <strong>recommendations to the European Commission</strong> taking stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-projects in their <em>Final reports on Societal Readiness.<strong> </strong></em>Practical improvements of the current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision<sup>[5]</sup> should be kept in mind when providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.</li> </ul><p>An analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) applied to R&amp;I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Battery recycling is of strategic importance for both Europe and India, not only to keep raw materials in the respective territories but also to reduce the environmental impact of the recycling process. R&amp;I in this area has been identified as a priority by the EU-India Trade and Technology Council’s Working Group on Green and Clean Energy Technology to reinforce bilateral cooperation.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Battery recyclers based in the EU and India benefit from of the improved sustainability, safety, and affordability of innovative recycling processes.</li><li>Stakeholders on battery recycling based in the EU and India benefit from each other’s experience on recycling logistics, including the informal processes and supply chain constraints.</li><li>The cooperation between EU and India key researchers, institutions and industries which are active in battery recycling is supported and strengthened. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Projects are expected to build a jointly operated recycling pilot line on Indian soil demonstrating innovative recycling processes for lithium-ion batteries going beyond the current state of the art in terms of recycling efficiency (in particular of Li), environmental impact, cost, and compatibility with different types of batteries (including those currently on the market and to be anticipated in the coming years). The pilot line must be able to process black mass including mixed chemistries with Li as end product, with a purity level suitable for Cathode Active Material (CAM). Recovery of graphite or silicon/graphite in various compositions should also be addressed. Adequate benchmarking figures must be provided to show progress beyond the state of the art.</p><p>Projects are also expected to demonstrate effective use of technologies for logistics, sorting, collection and discharging of end-of-life batteries. This should involve the informal sector (i.e. end users, collection points, sales channels) and include the following two areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of innovative and digitalised waste collection systems towards zero-risk to improve quantity, quality, safety of the stored End of Life batteries</li><li>Safe, fast, cost-efficient ways for large-scale discharging/deactivation End of Life batteries (both damaged and scraps), anticipating the development for new chemistries.</li> </ul><p>Projects are furthermore expected to assess the environmental impact of the piloted innovations in the recycling processes through Life Cycle Analysis.</p><p>Projects to be aligned with the missions, policies and priorities in the area of battery recycling, in both the regions (India and the EU). On the Indian side, alignment with relevant regulatory and strategic frameworks is expected, such as the Battery Waste Management Rules (2022) and the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage. EU projects are expected to build upon the activities of past and ongoing recycling-related projects under the BATT4EU partnership, as well as progress being made on the implementation of the Battery Passport. Projects are furthermore expected to be in line with the Batteries Regulation<sup>[1]</sup> (in particular with sections referring to recycling efficiency) and the Safe and Sustainable by Design guidelines<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>The exploitation of results, including IPR, should be appropriately addressed in the proposal.</p><p>Joint work should benefit from the Indian and European experience in battery recycling. Aligned projects should have the same start date, the same duration, same targets, and must show clearly how the coordination among them will bring added scientific value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects a genuine EU-Indian cooperation, aligned projects should involve properly coordinated research activities between EU and India in the jointly developed research plan of the two coordinated projects. Independent projects, which are not aligned, will be considered ineligible. Proposals will include detailed explanations about tasks and effort of the coordinated proposal as a whole and cross-references to the other part of the proposal.</p><p>The coordinated call aims at exploiting synergies between India and Europe in terms of scientific expertise and resources in topics related to battery recycling by implementing coordinated projects. Potential areas for collaboration (i.e. the coordinated part of the call) could include (but are not limited to) demonstration of more flexible and adaptable recycling processes capable of treating mixed battery chemistries; innovative &amp; digitalised waste collection systems; advanced sorting systems; active monitoring systems for high level of safety; safe, fast and cost-efficient discharging/deactivation (gen4 included); prediction for second-life use of batteries, diagnostics including State of Health.</p><p>The topic is within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in relation to battery recycling technologies. For the purposes of this topic, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI), Government of India has made the required funding available for the coordinated projects of the Indian side. A balanced effort and matched budget between Europe and India regarding the two coordinated calls are expected.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj\">Regulation - 2023/1542 - EN - EUR-Lex</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/recommendation-safe-and-sustainable-chemicals-published-2022-12-08_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/recommendation-safe-and-sustainable-chemicals-published-2022-12-08_en</a></p>"

Appropriate KPI must be defined for the energy density (volumetric and gravimetric), Power density and C-rate, number of cycles and cost defined under operational conditions.</li><li>Boost EU competitiveness in next-generation battery technologies for mobility applications.</li><li>Develop pilot manufacturing capability for next generation lithium-based batteries.</li><li>Strengthen the EU battery value chain, including new manufacturing equipment, automation, and scalable production processes.</li><li>Advance the understanding of next-generation battery interfaces at an industrial scale, ensuring manufacturability, durability, and cost-effectiveness. </li><li>In the case of aviation, the battery requirements should be compatible at minimum with EASA CS.23 (level 4), CS.27 and preferably with CS.25 categories. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic will support the scaling-up of next generation (i.e., beyond generation 3) lithium-based batteries (e.g., semi and all-solid state, generation5) from cell prototypes (TRL 4-5) to demonstration of scalable production and demonstration of cell integration into module/pack level. The projects will cover pilot production, process automation, system integration and demonstration, advanced cell design, and supply chain development to ensure that Europe remains at the forefront of battery innovation.</p><p>The projects must address the needs of a single specific and strategically relevant transport mode, and the targeted mode must be clearly indicated in the proposal. The following transport modes are in scope: Automotive; Aviation; Rail; Waterborne.</p><p>The projects are expected to cover all of the following production targets:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Upscaling of components production Technologies:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Optimisation and pilot-scale integration methods of anode and cathode materials compatible with next generation electrolytes </li>   </ul> </li><li>Development of Cell Concepts, Manufacturing Equipment and Machinery   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Development of flexible and high-throughput processing methods for large-scale cell production (e.g., laser patterning, vacuum sintering, and advanced calendaring). </li><li>Development of next-generation production machinery, tailored for next generation lithium-ion cell manufacturing (e.g., solid electrolyte deposition tools, high-precision stacking machines). </li>   </ul> </li><li>Design and demonstration of module and packs into vehicles/relevant environment   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Develop module/pack design and relevant sensors and Battery Management Systems (BMS), optimised for supporting the system, for seamless cell-to-system integration, regulatory compliance, and specific end-user application requirements. </li><li>Perform comprehensive validation, including performance, durability, and safety testing under realistic operational conditions, addressing thermal management, mechanical stress, vibration resistance, and electrical performance at relevant scales. </li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design<sup>[1]</sup> (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered as a reference for project proposals.</p><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)<sup>[2]</sup> whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website<sup>[3]</sup> (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu)</p><p>JRC will assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) and the co-programmed Partnership on Advanced Manufacturing in Europe (Made in Europe).

This can be accelerated by modernising the construction sector and embracing the latest developments in robotics and automated systems. There is need for further research on innovative on-site robotic and other automated solutions and techniques that make renovation and construction works more sustainable, less disruptive, faster, as well as more accurate, cost effective and resource efficient.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Test and validate the use of innovative on-site robotic and automated solutions and techniques both for construction of buildings and for renovation of which at least one must investigate 3D printing;</li><li>Apply a research methodology which allows for a robust comparison of at least the three expected outcomes of the proposed innovative solutions and techniques with current best practices;</li><li>Investigate aspects of on-site workers’ safety and human-robot collaboration related to the future application of the proposed solutions and techniques;</li><li>Test and validate at least three prototype solutions and techniques to investigate their applicability for a variety of building typologies, duly justified to represent a relevant part of the European building stock. The prototypes should be validated in a lab or another relevant environment. Testing and validation must address solutions for both renovation and construction. The prototypes should be applicable either to renovation, or to construction, or to both, but both renovation and construction need to be addressed in a proposal.</li> </ul><p>Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value regarding various aspects of on-site robotics for construction and renovation, as well as performing experimental research for validating full-scale prototype buildings renovated and/or constructed with robotic solutions.</p>"

Smart buildings can contribute to reducing energy demand, curbing operational CO2 emissions, integrating RES and enhancing grid flexibility through optimised energy usage. At the same time, it is essential that smart buildings are flexible and adaptive to changing needs and usage patterns and are user-friendly to encourage widespread adoption of these technologies by grid operators, construction professionals, building facility managers and users. Furthermore, to ensure the societal benefits of the smart building technologies there is a need for increased user knowledge, acceptance and satisfaction.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop solutions that enhance the smartness of buildings by using and facilitating the upgrade of existing Building (Energy) Management Systems (BMS/BEMS) and/or other technical equipment;</li><li>Ensure that the proposed solutions are user-friendly and provide the expected indoor environmental quality, as well as user satisfaction and occupant comfort;</li><li>Demonstrate the proposed solutions in at least three pilots. These pilots should collectively cover at least three different climatic zones, three different building types (residential, tertiary etc.), and three different technical building systems;</li><li>Develop a methodology to measure the achieved energy demand reduction, increased flexibility in the grid, and enhanced interoperability, compared to current best practices;</li><li>Investigate the cost-effectiveness and replicability of the proposed solutions. </li> </ul><p><u>This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.</li><li>This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities. </li> </ul>"

A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and renovation projects. Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the built environment;</li><li>Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics. In at least two cases, the proposed planning methods and procedures should be relevant for renovation;</li><li>Investigate the use of innovative tools and methods which facilitate the adaptation of the buildings stock to changing user needs, while positively contributing to occupants’ comfort and health;</li><li>Propose and apply a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the developed pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, including the calculation of their whole life carbon reduction compared to a “business as usual” scenario;</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders of the whole renovation and construction value chain, which must include among others: municipalities, citizens (including vulnerable groups) and civil society organisations and the building and construction sector professions;</li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and its network of innovation clusters<sup>[2]</sup>.</li> </ul><p>Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on innovative building solutions for resource efficiency, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People).

Such domains include, for example, climate mitigation, integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage in buildings, grid connections, accommodation of distributed energy generation and storage at district level, permitting, data privacy and security and the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Presently, these constraints, which inhibit the demonstration of complete and qualified PEDs, require the cooperation of key professionals from the public and private sector, such as municipal and regional authorities and those from the energy and construction sectors, in complex implementation processes.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate innovative approaches and solutions for overcoming constraints which prevent the successful implementation of PEDs;</li><li>Develop supportive local planning frameworks for the design and realisation of PEDs;</li><li>Demonstrate the proposed approaches, solutions, and supportive local planning frameworks in at least three districts in diverse geographical areas that implement energy efficiency measures alongside renewable energy installations, storage solutions, digital and smart technologies, and local energy communities;</li><li>Develop and/or update existing guidelines, tools, and training materials for key professionals that will enable other cities to successfully replicate these innovative approaches, solutions and supportive local planning frameworks in their district/cities;</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders, including citizens, through co-creation processes and community engagement activities. </li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p>"

Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;</li><li>Develop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions; </li><li>Validate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;</li><li>Research the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;</li><li>Consider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;</li><li>Contribute to the development of European standards<sup>[2]</sup>, where relevant;</li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters<sup>[3]</sup>. </li> </ul><p>Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>“<a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/923706b7-8f41-11ee-8aa6-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings</a>”, European Union, 2023’.

Where possible, the integration with neighbouring industries and/or communities should be considered for the benefit of energy and resources sharing and efficiency.</p><p>The solution should be designed to ensure that the industrial process avoids or has very low GHG and other pollutant emissions, ensures high reliability and safety, and high physical and cyber security. It should be physically demonstrated in an industrial environment and be applicable to a significant share of the total energy demand of the industrial plant. The project should demonstrate through numerical simulations that the physically demonstrated solution can be scaled up to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>The project should facilitate the future deployment of the solution in the EU and Associated Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector(s). Already before starting the design phase, the needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same industrial sector(s) should be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can be adapted to meet most of them, to identify common components to be optimised/standardised and to issue/disseminate technical and economic guidelines.</p><p>Proposals are expected to present a strong business model and sound exploitation strategy for the proposed solution, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.</p>"

There is still limited understanding how smart buildings solutions impact the energy performance of buildings and users’ comfort in practice. Research is required on the technical, social, and economic factors that influence how different groups – defined by their social, educational, age, and financial status – use and interact with smart buildings and systems. The whole-life cycle impacts of smart building have to be better understood, from design and construction to operation, maintenance, end-of-life and circular re-use, to ensure delivery of sustainable and cost-effective smart building solutions.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Research and quantify how existing and novel smart building solutions meet the needs of different social and economic groups (based on their gender, age, educational and financial status, etc.);</li><li>Identify major barriers and enablers for the use of smart building solutions among different socio-demographic and socio-economic groups, and research how it impacts the energy performance of buildings;</li><li>Validate of findings in at least three different categories of existing buildings (e.g. private residential, social housing, commercial building, office building, etc.), each one in a different Member State or Associated Country.</li><li>Develop actionable recommendations tailored to key stakeholders (such as equipment providers, architects, building owners and facility managers) to support the design, deployment and operation of inclusive, user-centric smart building solutions.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to contribute to the objectives of Built4People, transfer knowledge to its network of innovation clusters<sup>[1]</sup> and report on results in support of the monitoring of the Built4People KPIs.</p><p>Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of scientific advice and technical analysis of solutions and technologies, support to the transfer of research output to standards, and access to the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment research infrastructure for full-scale testing of buildings.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/\">https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/</a></p>"

Renovation approaches should cover the whole workflow from design, off-site manufacturing and on-site installation to strategies for maintenance, operation and end of life.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate cost-effective approaches (comprising design, planning and construction processes and techniques) for deep renovation to at least NZEB performance levels of multi-storey buildings (&gt; 5-storeys);</li><li>Ensure that the approaches make use of prefabricated solutions that are adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into a variety of existing building elements and features (e.g. various existing wall materials, presence of balconies and overhangs, existing piping in the way, etc.);</li><li>Ensure that the approaches minimise the disturbance for building owners, tenants and users, notably through a significant time reduction of on-site construction activities and of unavailability of the building and its main functionalities, and a minimal impact on occupancy comfort during the renovation;</li> </ul><p>Demonstrate the proposed approaches tailored to three multi-storey buildings (&gt; 5-storeys), each in a different Member States or Associated Countries and covering different building categories (residential or non-residential). This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People).

Several projects have focused on developing data analytics tools to integrate building energy performance certificates (EPCs) with other tools like the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI), Building Renovation Passports (BRPs), and Digital Building Logbooks into a unified framework or global information tool. More work is needed to integrate whole life carbon data in energy information tools to capture both operational carbon (energy used during the building's use phase) and embodied carbon (associated with extraction of raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, construction, and eventual disposal or recycling), as well as the (potential for) carbon removal in sustainably sourced construction products. On the other hand, more robust life cycle assessments based on more accurate and reliable national and international life cycle inventories of embodied environmental flows are needed to set up a solid construction digital product passport system.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate digital data exchange platforms for buildings to enable the development of comprehensive building information tools, assessments and/or certificates. These platforms should incorporate a wide range of data from, for example, whole life carbon assessments, national/international databases of embodied flow coefficients for construction materials and products, Digital Product Passports, Energy Performance Certificates, Smart Readiness Indicators, Building Renovation Passports, and Digital Building Logbooks.</li><li>Use advanced data analytics and wherever possible existing recognised data standards to exchange data and ensure the interoperability with real-time digital twins and BIM-based models.</li><li>Validate the proposed platforms in at least three large scale pilots. These pilots must encompass a range of building types (such as residential, commercial, educational, etc.) and address diverse use cases (including energy monitoring, renovation optimization, etc.). </li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to contribute to the objectives of Built4People, transfer knowledge to its network of innovation clusters<sup>[1]</sup> and report on results in support of the monitoring of the Built4People KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/\">https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/</a></p>"

One of the key principles for housing renovation towards 2030 and 2050 is affordability, i.e. making energy efficient, comfortable, healthy, sustainable and climate-resilient buildings widely available, in particular for medium and lower-income households and vulnerable people and areas. A better understanding of the impact of current policy frameworks on the affordable housing sector and on energy poverty is needed.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Research the effectiveness and implications of existing policies at different levels of governance (from local to European), regulations, support instruments and business models on the renovation and provision of rental properties in the affordable housing sector.</li><li>Validate a methodology for comparing the affordability of different types of rented properties located in different local housing markets, with different climate conditions, and for different demographic groups, including those in a vulnerable situation;</li><li>Design and validate new or improved solutions (policies, regulations, support instruments and/or business models) that improve affordability while still meeting decarbonisation targets for the housing sector. Quantify the effects of those solutions on the cost of a ‘deep renovation’ of rental properties in the affordable housing sector, considering the scale of the renovation (e.g. small multi-apartment buildings, large multi-apartment buildings; groups of buildings) and the type of governance and ownership models.</li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to contribute to the objectives of Built4People, transfer knowledge to its network of innovation clusters<sup>[1]</sup> and report on results in support of the monitoring of the Built4People KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are encouraged to share information, best practice, and results with the 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impact'.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/\">https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/</a></p>"

Thermal and/or electrical energy storage can be integrated, if it can contribute to better matching heat sources with process needs and/or to offer more flexible electricity consumption from the grid.</p><p>The temperature of the heat supplied to the process is not specified, but the proposals will be evaluated on their potential to enable the deployment of heat upgrade solutions in more sector(s) and process(es), where they are not yet state-of-the art.</p><p>Projects must address all the following items:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Optimise and demonstrate physically within one or more operational industrial site(s), the transformation of process(es) in at least one industrial sector, by recovering excess/waste heat from the process itself, possibly combined with local renewable heat or heat recovered in nearby locations and local thermal and/or electrical energy storage, and by upgrading the heat (e.g. with heat pump) for use in the process(es).</li><li>Maximise the replicability and deployment of the concept/solution in the EU and Associated Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector. Already before starting the design phase, the needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same industrial sector(s) should be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can be adapted to meet most of them.</li><li>Identify common components, optimise and define a standardised version of them.</li><li>Develop open technical and economical guidelines and open tools for system design and business case development.</li><li>In case the targeted industrial sector(s) and process(es) has/have been covered by the actions under the topic LIFE-2024-CET-HEATPUMPS<sup>[1]</sup>, this proposal should build on the results of these actions and if possible, cooperate with them, both for the definition of the solution to demonstrate and the dissemination channels.</li><li>Disseminate results notably (but not only) to the relevant communities in cluster 4 ‘Digital, Industry and Space’ private-public partnerships and to JRC Sevilla and INCITE for work on BREFs in the context of the IED2.0.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/life-2024-cet-heatpumps\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/life-2024-cet-heatpumps</a></p>"

There is need for further development of techniques using innovative on-site robotic and other automated systems that make renovation and construction works more sustainable, less disruptive, faster as well as more accurate, cost effective and resource efficient, while delivering, at least, the same building elements’ energy performance compared to current best practices. Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate innovative on-site robotic and automated techniques for building renovation and the construction of new buildings. At least one of the proposed techniques should involve 3D printing;</li><li>Develop techniques that are specifically for building-site applications (e.g. solutions focusing on prefabrication in workshops/factories away from the building site are out oof the scope), flexible to adapt to various building typologies and, where possible, to materials and components already on the market;</li><li>Ensure that the proposed techniques appropriately take into account aspects of on-site workers’ safety and human-robot collaboration;</li><li>Demonstrate the proposed techniques in at least three demonstrations to investigate their applicability for a variety of building typologies and climatic conditions, duly justified to represent a relevant part of the European building stock. Proposals must address the energy renovation of existing buildings but may also address new constructions. </li> </ul><p>Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of scientific advice and technical analysis of solutions and technologies, support to the transfer of research output to standards, and access to the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment research infrastructure for full-scale testing of buildings.</p>"

Small IT rooms or small data centres are an essential part of the twin green and digital transition. It is important to address the energy and resources consumption over the full ICT value chain. Solutions already exist, such as re-using waste heat from data centres, or moving towards circular models (longer lifetimes, reparability, reuse and recyclability). Most recent analysis suggests that the energy consumption of consumer devices in 2020 accounted for roughly 50% of the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies, with the two next largest contributors being respectively the production of ICT devices (~20%) and the operation of data centres (~15%)<sup>[1]</sup>. Moreover, this is expected to change dramatically by 2030, as the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies is expected to increase by 50% over this decade. The Commission has set the strategic goal of ensuring that data centres are climate-neutral, energy- and resource efficient by 2030. However, most efforts are directed towards data centres in scope of the Energy Efficiency Directive recast.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate state-of-the-art holistic and cost-effective approaches to thermal management and excess heat recovery (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade of heat) and re-use in local or nearby site creating effective added value in existing IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres (in the range of 100-500kW, not covered by Energy Efficiency Directive recast), taking into account thermal envelope/building (by means of simulation or digital twins, among others), integration with building automation and control systems and potential to improve the self-assessment and self-optimisation functionalities at all levels, and integration into existing BMS allowing for further development of energy services. Demonstrators should be located in both cold and warm climate Member State or Associated Country to tackle climate specific challenges of thermal management of waste heat.</li><li>Develop business cases for state-of-the-art solutions for excess heat recovery &amp; re-use (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade), for example by re-using excess heat in an existing system in the building (such as heating or water production purposes), or in a local district heating and cooling network, or in any other local or nearby site creating effective added value to the recovered heat.</li> </ul><p>Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 4 HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-09: Energy efficiency and sustainability of AI data processing in Data Centres (IA) demonstration pilots.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022SC0341\">eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022SC0341</a></p>"

The complexity of these circularity strategies, such as material reuse and recycling, and addressing the changing nature of assessed systems with long life cycles are critical for achieving more reliable assessment results. Further work is needed to advance and achieve more detailed modelling frameworks that integrate circularity assessment with life cycle assessment, supporting the delivery of net-zero whole-life carbon buildings.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop a comprehensive modelling framework that integrates circularity assessment in life cycle, covering cradle to cradle system boundary;</li><li>Apply the developed modelling framework to at least three real-life buildings in different climatic regions in different Member States or Associated Countries, for which renovation project developers have adopted ambitious circularity strategies to achieve zero whole-life carbon buildings. Circularity strategies should include reuse and/or recycle, as well as at least one of the following: reduce, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, and repurpose;</li><li>Assess the embodied emissions (from materials, products, and construction processes) and operational emissions (from energy use for HVAC, DHW, electrical appliances, lighting) of the real-life buildings subjected to renovations during their entire life cycle, referencing life cycle stages in EN 15978. </li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to contribute to the objectives of Built4People, transfer knowledge to its network of innovation clusters<sup>[1]</sup> and report on results in support of the monitoring of the Built4People KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/\">https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/</a></p>"

At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.</p><p>To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;</li><li>Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures<sup>[1]</sup>;</li><li>Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;</li><li>Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;</li><li>Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;</li><li>Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD). </li> </ul><p>Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04<sup>[2]</sup> and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.</p><p>As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01<sup>[3]</sup> and other directly relevant call topics.</p><p>In view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad<sup>[4]</sup> and Diversify – CCAM<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>In line with the European Artificial Intelligence strategy and requirements for trustworthy, explainable, and safe AI.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>AI for advanced and collective perception and decision making for CCAM applications</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Centralised, reliable, cyber-secure &amp; upgradable in-vehicle electronic control architectures for CCAM connected to the cloud-edge continuum.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Cocreate, Embrace – grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101147397\">101147397</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>Diversify CCAM by integrating European cultural and regional variations in the design and implementation of citizen-friendly systems to foster mobility equity - grant agreement id: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101147484\">101147484</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Validated human behavioural models representing the variety of human driving behaviour in safety-relevant scenarios, shared through a common repository and to be used:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>to define pass criteria/ assessment criteria for CCAM systems in type approval schemes, consumer testing campaigns and industrial development processes; </li><li>to design safe, human-like behaviour of CCAM systems that can be anticipated easily by all road users and is acceptable to both CCAM vehicle occupants and all road users. </li>   </ul> </li><li>Application of such human behavioural models in the virtual safety validation of CCAM systems to realistically represent the behaviour of human-driven vehicles in closed loop simulations of mixed traffic, thereby reflecting the variety of human driving behaviour, including behaviour in complex real-world and emergency conditions. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.</p><p>This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving<sup>[1]</sup> and BERTHA<sup>[2]</sup> for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.</p><p>To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.</p><p>Proposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART<sup>[3]</sup> and SUNRISE<sup>[4]</sup> and complemented by the project SYNERGIES<sup>[5]</sup>. Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02<sup>[6]</sup>. Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.</p><p>To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for the parametrisation and validation of behavioural models, while considering regional and cultural differences as well as specificities of respective road infrastructures.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[8]</sup>.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Integrated 4D driver modelling under uncertainty, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://i4driving.eu/\">101076165</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>BEhavioural ReplicaTion of Human drivers for CCAM, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://berthaproject.eu/\">101076360</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Harmonised European solutions for testing automated road transport, grant agreement id: <a href=\"https://www.headstart-project.eu/\">824309</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://ccam-sunrise-project.eu/\">101069573</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101146542\">101146542</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] Generation of scenarios for development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>Federated CCAM data exchange platform (see below).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.</p><p>To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.</p><p>Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.</p><p>To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus<u>,</u> it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM<sup>[1]</sup> and AIthena<sup>[2]</sup>.</li><li>Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES<sup>[3]</sup>. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects;</li><li>Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently;</li><li>Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change.</li> </ul><p>The research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act.</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Trustworthy AI for CCAM, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101076911\">101076911</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101076754\">101076754</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101146542\">101146542</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space<sup>[1]</sup> aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).</p><p>Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&amp;I initiatives. The FAME<sup>[2]</sup> project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&amp;I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&amp;I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE<sup>[3]</sup> and SYNERGIES<sup>[4]</sup>. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre<sup>[5]</sup>. In parallel, the DeployEMDS<sup>[6]</sup> builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.</p><p>Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena<sup>[7]</sup> and AWARE2ALL<sup>[8]</sup> have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks. </p><p>By establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society.</p><p>Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps;</li><li>Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space;</li><li>Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles;</li><li>Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators;</li><li>Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform;</li><li>Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures. </li> </ul><p>A strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects<sup>[9]</sup> is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl<sup>[10]</sup>. The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space (<a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/data-sharing/\">Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving</a>). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/edic\">EDIC</a>) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces.</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[11]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/smart-mobility/creating-common-european-mobility-data-space_en\">Creating a common European mobility data space - European Commission (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Framework for coordination of Automated Mobility in Europe, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069898\">101069898</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://ccam-sunrise-project.eu/\">101069573</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101146542\">101146542</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://dssc.eu/space/BPE/179175433/Data+Spaces+Blueprint+%7C+Version+0.5+%7C+September+2023\">Data Spaces Blueprint</a><sup> </sup></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>See for more information: <a href=\"https://deployemds.eu/\">https://deployemds.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101076754\">101076754</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>Safety systems and human-machine interfaces oriented to diverse population towards future scenarios with increasing share of highly automated vehicles, grant agreement ID: <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101076868\">101076868</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup>The awarded proposal should build on the outcomes of the preparatory action PrepDSpace4Mobility and the EMDS study under CEF.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><p>Demonstration of combined solutions for infrastructure construction that achieve the following targets:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>At least 50% of the construction materials used are recycled or sourced from recycled materials;</li><li>Reduced pollutant emissions by at least 30% considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure;</li><li>Reduced degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats during construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of transport infrastructure (thereby contributing to maintaining biodiversity);</li><li>Increased climate resilience of infrastructure to extreme weather and human caused events, assuring at least 80% capacity at network level during the disruptions;</li><li>Structured analysis and recommendations on the need for EU standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;</li><li>Guiding document on the necessary adaptations to public procurement rules that contribute to including clear sustainability and resilience award criteria. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050<sup>[1]</sup>. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.</p><p>The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy<sup>[2]</sup> (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.</p><p>Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;</li><li>Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;</li><li>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;</li><li>Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;</li><li>Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);</li><li>Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;</li><li>Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;</li><li>Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS<sup>[3]</sup>), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity. </li> </ul><p>The projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment<sup>[4]</sup> (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks<sup>[5]</sup>, in particular cascading impacts across sectors.</p><p>Proposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards,<sup>[6]</sup> and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures. If the proposed activities and solutions involve the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and/or techniques, the proposal is expected to demonstrate that robustness of the solution.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/transport-and-green-deal_en\">Transport and the Green Deal - European Commission (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/be22d311-4a07-4c29-8b72-d6d255846069_en?filename=2021-mobility-strategy-and-action-plan.pdf</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutions_en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment\">European Climate Risk Assessment — European Environment Agency (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52024DC0091\">EUR-Lex - 52024DC0091 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>https://im-safe-project.eu/</p>"

In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.</p><p>Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.</p><p>The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.</p><p>Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/digital-transport-and-logistics-forum-dtlf_en\">Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF)</a> and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13566-Transport-data-creating-a-common-European-mobility-data-space-communication-_en\">European mobility data space (EMDS)</a>.</p><p>Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.</p><p>Building on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;</li><li>Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.</li><li>Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.</li><li>Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.</li><li>Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation;</li><li>Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics;</li><li>Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU<sup>[2]</sup>, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive<sup>[3]</sup>, and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain;</li><li>Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR<sup>[4]</sup>, digital identities<sup>[5]</sup>, data spaces<sup>[6]</sup>, AI act<sup>[7]</sup>, Data Governance Act<sup>[8]</sup>, Cybersecurity Act<sup>[9]</sup>; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance. </li><li>Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices.</li><li>Identify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs. </li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52023PC0441</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022L2464</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0868</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019R0881</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Input is provided for the implementation of the existing and forthcoming Union’s regulatory initiatives related to measurement, calculation and reporting of emissions in transport, such as Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)<sup>[1]</sup>, Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)<sup>[2]</sup>, and the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)<sup>[3]</sup>;</li><li>Methodological components are developed and proposed to complement the methodology for accounting emissions provided under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.</p><p>Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)<sup>[1]</sup>, Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)<sup>[2]</sup>, Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV)<sup>[6]</sup> and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)<sup>[3]</sup>, and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);</li><li>Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting &amp; Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER)<sup>[8]</sup>;</li><li>Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards<sup>[9]</sup>;</li><li>Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport<sup>[10]</sup>;</li><li>Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector. </li> </ul><p>Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;</li><li>Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;</li><li>Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;</li><li>New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;</li><li>Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information<sup>[11]</sup>. </li> </ul><p>The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services. </p><p>The proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; </li><li>radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; </li><li>GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; </li><li>GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format; </li><li>GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded; </li><li>GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations. </li>   </ul> </li><li>Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations; </li><li>allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft. </li>   </ul> </li><li>Based on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU);</li><li>Building on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive)<sup>[12]</sup> must be ensured;</li><li>Define R&amp;I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions measuring framework. </li> </ul><p>The project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Mechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>COM(2023) 441 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>COM(2023) 441 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>https://emissionfactors.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup>This standard has also been formally adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) under the reference CEN ISO 14083</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <sup> </sup>https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9781f65f-8448-11ea-bf12-01aa75ed71a1</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[11] <sup> </sup>Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[12] <sup> </sup>Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources, and repealing Council Directive (EU) 2015/652</p>"

The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;</li><li>Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive<sup>[4]</sup> and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;</li><li>Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle;</li><li>Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC);</li><li>Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT;</li><li>Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains. </li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>COM(2021) 324 final <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324\">eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download\">https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future, COM/2020/789 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=CELEX:32023L2661\">Directive (EU) 2023/2661</a></p>"

This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;</li><li>Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;</li><li>Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;</li><li>Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;</li><li>Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;</li><li>Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards;</li><li>Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices;</li><li>smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic;</li><li>road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project;</li><li>development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc).</p><p>Proposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety<strong> </strong>and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning.</p><p>Proposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions<sup>[1]</sup> and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and behavioural norms.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>E.g. https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/861570 and <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430</a> projects</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Knowledge of high-risk locations along the road network becoming available, before crashes actually occur, enabling road authorities to deploy appropriate countermeasures proactively;</li><li>Predictive identification of safety-critical situations based on data from multiple sources and enabling real-time interventions to avoid crashes;</li><li>Determination of the optimal sample size to allow for reliable real-time crash occurrence prediction;</li><li>Enhanced monitoring of traffic flows and incorporation of traffic flow variations and patterns in real-time crash prediction, which will also lead to more effective traffic management by foreseeing unexpected or disruptive events. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.</p><p>In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.</p><p>Proposals should address all the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON<sup>[1]</sup> could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);</li><li>Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;</li><li>Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;</li><li>Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;</li><li>Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;</li><li>Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;</li><li>Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;</li><li>Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services.</li> </ul><p>Particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.</p><p>Ways to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.</p><p>Research is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955269</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The need to perform research in the field of icing, to ensuring safety and efficiency of proposed new solutions (TRL 3-5), is justified by the increasing incidence of weather hazards caused by climate change, the new generation of low carbon dioxide (CO2) aircraft with associated disruptive configurations, and the stringency of new policies and certification rules.</p><p>In the mid-term, project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Generating scientific expertise to develop means of compliance for the certification of icing systems;</li><li>Generating scientific knowledge to be able to develop new prototypes of ice detection and protection. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade.</p><p>The aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.</p><p>To enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&amp;I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):</p><p>1. R&amp;I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;</li><li>Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;</li><li>Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);</li><li>Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability. </li> </ul><p>2.<strong> </strong>R&amp;I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>3. R&amp;I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;</li><li>High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);</li><li>Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);</li><li>Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters. </li> </ul><p>This research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>RES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection</li><li>RES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD)</li><li>RES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis</li><li>RMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements</li><li>RMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance degradation </li> </ol><p>A close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Note: the project will assess the use of specific models for the prediction of icing conditions (e.g., addressing cloud micro-physics for the formation ice crystals, super cooled water droplets), which can be coupled to climate models (e.g., General Circulation Models).</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This flagship pilot is the culmination of the entire activity catalogue carried out by the CCAM Partnership since its launch in 2021. It will combine in one project the most promising CCAM use-cases across three key domains, with the technological advancements from all its R&amp;I clusters<sup>[1]</sup> supporting and enabling CCAM systems and services towards market uptake.</p><p>This action is expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Large-scale demonstrations of inclusive, user-oriented, and well-integrated CCAM systems and services for people and goods in mixed traffic through Field Operational Tests (FOTs), Technology Pilots, and Living Labs, building upon advanced and emerging SAE Level 2 systems to move towards SAE Level 3 and 4 functionalities, at multiple test sites and corridors showcasing CCAM potential<sup>[2]</sup>, for a minimum of 12 months.</li><li>Validation of enabling technologies that facilitate the extension of Operational Design Domains (ODDs) in large-scale operations and enhance perception performance under poor lighting and adverse weather conditions in large-scale demonstrations and pilots. Assessment of deployment readiness and demonstration of technological maturity focusing on their reliability, security, and real-world applicability.</li><li>Identification of the remaining technological and societal development needs to accelerate deployment and drive user and societal demand. These demonstrations will strengthen the connection with users and society through a co-creative process, ensuring that technological developments align with real-world needs and societal expectations.</li><li>Recommendations for regulatory action aimed at facilitating the deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) in Europe, by engaging with relevant policy and regulatory bodies.</li><li>Identification and selection of viable business models for each of the use-cases explored per domain, aiming for continued operation after the flagship pilot through private investment or national/local public funding including mechanisms for transferability and replicability to enable a broader application of results to other cities and regions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>CCAM solutions are expected to provide a more user-centred, inclusive mobility system that enhances safety, reduces congestion, lowers harmful emissions, and contributes to decarbonization. In addition, CCAM solutions enhance transport effectiveness, thereby strengthening Europe's competitiveness in the global mobility sector. Novel mobility services can enable seamless integration with existing services such as public transport and logistics, while higher levels of automation are expected to boost transport productivity and efficiency. However, the benefits of these solutions must be proven through large-scale demonstrations, validating their effectiveness for both people and goods. It is also of key importance to integrate and test enabling vehicle technologies and to validate trusted communication and cyber security, as well as real time information transmission. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of technology maturity is necessary, evaluating the readiness of automated driving functions within mixed traffic conditions and in confined areas. This evaluation helps determine the readiness of automation technologies for deployment, considering factors such as operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and user acceptance. By fostering a systematic approach to large-scale demonstrations, technology validation, and maturity assessment, and by prioritising zero-emission mobility, these efforts contribute to the seamless integration of CCAM solutions across the entire public and private transport ecosystem.</p><p>The proposed action is expected to <strong>demonstrate</strong> different CCAM solutions and technologies in all the following domains:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Individual mobility</strong> within mixed traffic environments, encompassing urban, suburban, motorway, and rural settings, with a focus on the seamless integration of automated and conventional vehicles. Use cases should consider diverse road conditions, infrastructure variability, traffic dynamics, and user needs, ensuring safe, efficient, accessible and user-centric mobility solutions. A key aspect is the integration of advanced technologies (e.g. AI, V2X, cybersecurity, precise positioning, etc.) and the validation of technological enablers ensuring that automation solutions are robust, scalable, and adaptable to all CCAM use cases for people and goods.</li><li><strong>Shared mobility </strong>and <strong>public transport</strong> operations in urban, regional and rural areas, for end-to-end journeys aiming to enhance safety, accessibility, equity, and sustainability, including improving business cases for mobility providers. Validate realistic door-to-door mobility services including links to mobility hubs, ridesharing and parking areas to enhance end-to-end journeys in urban areas and regions.</li><li><strong>Freight transport</strong> for hub-to-hub, corridors, and <strong>logistics</strong> hubs on public roads and confined areas, integrating logistics, fleet and terminal operators. Validate realistic end-to-end use cases, such as logistics hubs at airports, ports, cross-border, and transhipment terminals, connecting use-cases in confined operations with TEN-T freight corridors.</li> </ul><p>Where relevant, intersecting social factors, such as gender, age, social origin and income level should be considered. All new vehicles acquired for the project's activities, as well as all vehicles participating in final demonstrations conducted in public spaces, are expected to be environmentally friendly, with a special focus on electric vehicles, to maximise synergies and ensure the future integration of solutions into the sustainable mobility mass market.</p><p>The proposed action should integrate all the following <strong>common activities </strong>across domains:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Ensuring close coordination and synergies with innovation actions planned under the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance, (ECAVA), in particular the Autonomous driving technology roadmap, announced by the European Automotive Action Plan.</li><li>Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action, <em>HORIZON-CL5-2025-01-D6-02: Preparing for large-scale CCAM demonstrations.</em><sup>[3]</sup></li><li>Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action <em>HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05</em> Robust Knowledge and Know-How transfer for Key-Deployment Pathways and implementation of the EU-CEM.<sup>[4]</sup></li><li>Ensuring close coordination, once launched, with <em>HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-08</em>: <em>Demand-side 3C pilot demonstrators on converged Telco Edge Cloud Infrastructure</em>, in particular the pilot demonstrator on unlocking telco-edge-cloud functions for the mobility ecosystem.</li><li>Ensuring inclusive engagement of all key European private stakeholders (e.g., shared mobility, public transport and logistics operators, infrastructure providers, associations, SMEs and start-ups, in particular technology developers), and notably a broad representation of the European OEMs, in addition to Tier-1 suppliers, as well as public players (e.g., municipalities/cities/regions, motorway operators, emergency service operators, public transport authorities, research institutions) and community groups (e.g., user groups) for the transport of people and goods, across their entire value chain, in the designated domains. Each of these shall contribute to European technological innovation, sovereignty and competitiveness and none shall contrive the security and/or public policy interests of the Union.</li><li>Assessing the transferability, adaptability, and scalability of advanced technologies such as photonics and Generative AI as key enablers for the extension of ODDs<u>,</u> ensuring broad deployment potential.</li><li>Executing public engagement and awareness campaigns to increase societal readiness and promoting the use of CCAM as well as implementing CCAM education and training programs.</li><li>Assessing the degree to which the demonstrated services comply with current regulatory requirements and providing recommendations to ensure full compliance.</li> </ul><p>Bringing forth real-world evidence on the effects, impacts, and long-term implications of integrating mixed CCAM solutions into the mobility system including long-term impact for users.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Exemplifying concrete and strategic benefits of vehicle-vehicle or vehicle-infrastructure cooperation to improve safety, optimize traffic flow, and enhance the overall efficiency of CCAM transportation networks considering both digital and physical infrastructure and including guidance for remote operations and management.</li><li>Using data from large-scale demonstrations to identify and extract pertinent scenarios and edge cases, ensuring these insights are systematically integrated into related databases for validation scenarios, while also exploring data sharing opportunities with relevant authorities.</li><li>Facilitating the interoperability of connected and automated systems across vehicle brands, regions, and Member States and Associated Countries, taking into consideration different traffic environments and road densities, also in line with the Automotive Action Plan on large-scale cross-border testbeds.</li><li>Encouraging collaboration with the European Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative by adopting existing interfaces and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are expected to build strongly upon, and collaborate closely with, the CSA resulting from HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02<sup>[5]</sup>, “Preparing for large-scale CCAM demonstrations”, ensuring that the implementation of their activities and findings aligns with the strategic direction outlined in the CSA.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.ccam.eu/our-actions/clusters/\">https://www.ccam.eu/our-actions/clusters/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Such as previous experience in testing, developing and deploying CCAM services.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02\">https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02?keywords=ccam&amp;isExactMatch=true&amp;status=31094501,31094502,31094503&amp;frameworkProgramme=43108390&amp;order=DESC&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;sortBy=relevance\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02?keywords=ccam&amp;isExactMatch=true&amp;status=31094501,31094502,31094503&amp;frameworkProgramme=43108390&amp;order=DESC&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;sortBy=relevance</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

These should be developed using advanced foresight methods <u>(</u>e.g. qualitative scenarios, horizon scanning, technology roadmapping, etc.), complemented by iterative validation through a minimum of 3 dedicated Living Labs selected to represent diverse European regions, urbanisation levels, and governance capacities, ensuring a structured, robust, and anticipatory approach to long-term decision-making.</li><li>A data-driven understanding of the socioeconomic effects of different CCAM deployment pathways, based on a quantified assessment across Member States and Associated Countries, economic sectors, and demographic groups, at national and cross-national levels, using innovative, integrated economic-transport modelling that captures dynamic interactions, systemic feedback loops, and long-term impacts. Socioeconomic effects may include, but are not limited to, employment and growth aspects, equity, and transport poverty.</li><li>Robust governance models, policies and business strategies (including for SMEs and micro-enterprises) that strengthen Europe’s leadership, economic resilience, and market positioning in CCAM, developed through interdisciplinary methods combining policy analysis, institutional diagnostics, and scenario-based stress testing, to ensure robustness under diverse future geopolitical and economic conditions. These should identify viable business cases, recommend sectoral R&amp;D priorities, and support innovation scaling for both public and private entities. Additionally, they should ensure long-term adaptability to geopolitical and market uncertainties, promote equitable growth, reduce external dependencies, and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, all while promoting sustainable growth.</li><li>Ensuring close coordination and synergies the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA), in particular the autonomous driving roadmap, announced by the European Automotive Action Plan.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>CCAM is a key area of global competition and one of the five pillars of the European Automotive Action Plan for the automotive sector, aimed at helping the industry regain its leadership in the shift towards smarter (AI-powered), cleaner, and more connected vehicles, However, CCAM deployment is shaped by evolving geopolitical dynamics, rapid technological advancements, and economic uncertainties. Europe must secure its leadership in CCAM and strengthen its socioeconomic resilience by continuously addressing vulnerabilities and identifying robust pathways for policy development and market deployment. This topic will assess the global geopolitical landscape of CCAM innovation, map future pathways, and develop evidence-based strategies for policymakers, businesses, and investors. The results will support robust, future-proof policies, business strategies, and investment frameworks, ensuring a resilient, inclusive, and competitive European CCAM ecosystem.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Conduct a comprehensive geopolitical and economic analysis of CCAM to map Europe’s strategic position in global competition. Identify vulnerabilities, dependencies and opportunities in business models, supply chains, critical raw materials, technological capabilities, digital and physical infrastructure, validation processes, safety benchmarks, and pricing strategies, supported by AI-driven analytics and innovation mapping tools. The analysis should also assess large-scale CCAM initiatives worldwide, identifying scaling trajectories, tipping points, commercialization barriers, and success factors. These insights should inform strategic policymaking, investment decisions, and Europe’s regulatory positioning in global CCAM markets.</li><li>Develop novel, stakeholder-driven participatory future scenarios to explore plausible geopolitical, technological, and economic developments affecting CCAM, and define associated transition pathways toward desirable European futures that ensure resilience, strategic autonomy, and competitiveness. Use advanced foresight methods (e.g. qualitative scenarios, horizon scanning, technology roadmapping, etc.), complemented by iterative validation through a minimum of three dedicated Living Labs, to understand trade-offs, assess risks, and define strategic priorities under different global conditions. The project should also identify KPIs that capture European added value, unique selling points, and global market positioning, and apply these to assess and guide CCAM competitiveness The project should also identify KPIs that measure the European added value, its unique selling points and global market positioning, to apply these KPIs to define CCAM competitiveness.</li><li>Assess the socioeconomic impacts of different CCAM deployment pathways, focusing on economic, employment, and social equity dimensions. Analyse income growth, employment effects, regional economic convergence, and productivity gains using integrated economic-transport modelling approaches that account for dynamic interactions and systemic feedback across Member States and Associated Countries, economic sectors, and demographic groups. Identify potential disparities and propose policy recommendations and investment strategies to ensure that CCAM contributes to inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic growth across all regions of Europe. This should include an evaluation of how CCAM deployment can reduce Europe’s reliance on external supply chains, while enhancing industrial competitiveness.</li><li>Develop robust policy recommendations, governance models, and business strategies informed by institutional diagnostics and tested under diverse future conditions through scenario-based stress testing to reinforce Europe’s leadership and economic resilience in CCAM. Ensure regulatory alignment with global standards, strengthen supply chain resilience by reducing reliance on non-EU dependencies, and promote an open yet competitive market environment. Business strategies should identify viable business cases, recommend sectoral R&amp;D priorities, and support innovation scaling, particularly for SMEs and micro-enterprises. Policies and strategies must be adaptable to shifting geopolitical and economic conditions, securing Europe’s long-term market competitiveness and technological sovereignty.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are expected to collaborate with the CCAM Technology Observatory by exploring and leveraging complementarities between their respective activities and findings<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM).

This is especially relevant for driving in more complex environments like urban areas, where environmental variance is higher and where new scenarios can be regularly encountered. Furthermore, there is the need to limit the latency, bandwidth and energy use for on-board calculations, as well as the need to enhance the security, privacy and reliability (e.g. scene understanding and prediction of near-future scenario development). For rapid decision-making in interactions with VRUs, this is essential for implementing CCAM-enabled solutions and ensuring scalability.</p><p>At the same time, developments of sector-agnostic technologies show advancements -such as GenAI- that can be beneficial for CCAM. First exploratory steps can be expected from a project funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02<sup>[1]</sup> regarding the potential in the virtual generation of edge cases, which could be used for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems.</p><p>Further advancements in GenAI applications specifically for the CCAM domain need to be developed, trained and validated<sup>[2]</sup>. Thus, proposed actions shall include approaches to exploit further technological advancements for CCAM. Major steps are needed to advance to highly advanced, ultra-safe, trustworthy and energy efficient real-time perception and decision-making systems for automated vehicles, specifically focusing on scalable solutions and the exploitation of GenAI. These advancements should leverage low latency systems or distributed computing resources to facilitate real-time processing, thereby improving system responsiveness and safety. This topic will thus contribute to the AI Continent Action Plan<sup>[3]</sup> by fostering AI development and adoption in the automotive sector.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of tools and approaches for robust environment perception and decision making (at the edge, on-board, at infrastructure or back-office). These approaches shall aim at accelerating and advancing the reasoning of decision making, increasing the level of efficiency, (cyber)-security and reliability of the applications, with path planning as initial use case. This is to support amongst others the perception of VRUs, the prediction of their behaviour and their intentions, and includes data sharing approaches for CCAM solutions to create a larger time window for actions in near accident scenarios. The use of advanced GenAI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) or Vision Language Action (VLAs) can significantly enhance these capabilities by leveraging their advanced contextual reasoning and pattern recognition. Furthermore, GenAI can complement existing perception systems by improving sensory input interpretation and providing enriched environmental contexts, which enhance decision-making and adaptability.</li><li>Scenario generation of interactions of CCAM enabled vehicles with other road users, which is essential for advances in validation and testing, extending existing datasets and scenarios as GenAI can, based on existing data, deliver variations of scenarios (e.g. cultural differences of road users and infrastructure variability.)</li><li>Integration of GenAI technologies into existing approaches (development, training and validation) for their further enrichment. Understanding the limits of using GenAI technologies as well as the benefits and develop guidelines for valid approaches for this integration (including consideration of gender biases and fairness to ensure AI systems are transparent and accountable) and providing an outlook on the uptake of the tools and approaches developed can be done for a variety of CCAM components and technologies, as well as for systemic applications such as traffic management and remote control.</li><li>Encouraging collaboration with the European Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative by adopting existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework.</li> </ul><p>Proposed actions should include measures to ensure close coordination with the European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European Automotive Action Plan.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are expected to liaise with the ADRA Partnership<sup>[4]</sup> in order to explore and leverage complementarities between their respective activities and findings.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101146542\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101146542</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] This topic also encourages alignment with national projects and initiatives to allow building up of existing efforts and solutions.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ai-continent-action-plan\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ai-continent-action-plan</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] AI, Data and Robotics Association: https://adr-association.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

Despite policy goals to strengthen multimodal transport, double rail freight’s share by 2050, and increase transport by inland waterways and short sea shipping by 50% by 2050, unimodal road transport remains more competitive, and the growth of multimodal freight has been limited. </p><p>The lack of integration of rail, inland waterways and multimodal data into logistics and supply chain solutions is one of the main barriers, hindering the efficient and competitive adoption of multimodality. Furthermore, improving system resilience requires better tools and solutions for multimodal operators to manage disruptions and ensure supply chain continuity. </p><p>Building on the results of previously funded research projects and initiatives (including e.g. the Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking), proposals should address all of the following aspects: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building on data governance models set in the European Data Act, Common European Data Spaces and the electronic Freight Transport Information Regulation, develop interoperable tools and solutions integrated in existing platforms and solutions (also leveraging the full potential of e.g. Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and other emerging technologies) used by shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, warehouse operators, distribution centres, retailers and e-commerce platforms to connect with multimodal information (e.g. services, visibility, ETA, etc.). Developing any type of digital platform or similar is outside the scope of this topic. The proposed tools and solutions should also help operators to react rapidly to disruptions, considering strategies and alternatives for cases of failure, accidents, sabotage, force majeure, etc.</li><li>Map and identify datasets available or to be developed to enhance the integration of multimodal solutions in other supply chain processes (e.g. rail timetable information). Assess how new technologies (e.g. generative Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things) could be leveraged and applied, including, but not limited to, the procurement and management of smart containers (e.g. for real-time monitoring of cargo conditions, ETA). Explore synchromodality strategies for logistics hubs and multimodal transport networks. </li><li>Based on the business and technical requirements (e.g. transport management systems, data structures, data security) of both freight forwarders and shippers, develop interoperable solutions and tools to support freight forwarders and multimodal operators to address shippers’ demands in terms of information provision and sharing, including as regards logistic hubs and first / last mile connections. </li><li>Define use cases for multimodal transport for intra-European flows between 500 and 1,000 km (from first to last mile delivery), and collaborative business model(s) to shift freight transport demand to multimodal solutions. </li><li>Validate, measure the performance and demonstrate the proposed solutions and concepts in 2 large pilots along segments of the main European freight transport corridors, ensuring geographical balance and covering various types of industrial sectors (e.g. fast-moving consumer goods industry). The pilots should be carried out with the involvement and cooperation of relevant transport operators, logistic companies and infrastructure managers. </li><li>Assess and quantify the value generation (also in terms of sustainability and energy consumption reduction) of the proposed solutions for the shippers, multimodal operators and terminals. </li><li>Analyse and propose recommendations for contingency plans to address disruptions in multimodal supply chains. </li><li>Provide recommendations on possible revisions to the existing regulatory framework and propose initiatives to remove existing barriers to and facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of multimodal transport solutions. </li> </ul><p>Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan. Information exchange with Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking Flagship Area 5 is advised to avoid duplicated research.</p><p>If the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.</p>"

While cities are going through a rapid digital, green and social transformation, local and regional authorities play bigger roles and take on greater responsibilities in contributing to the prosperity, climate-neutrality and competitiveness of the European Union.</p><p>However, the deployment of innovative sustainable mobility solutions has been hampered by fragmentation of the support to cities at regional, national and EU level, lack of resources for experimentation with new approaches, insufficient knowledge on research results and innovative solutions, and difficulties for urban stakeholders to exchange knowledge, experiences and lessons learned, including providing feedback to policy makers and the research community.</p><p>The aim of this coordination and support action is to address the barriers to the deployment of innovative urban mobility projects’ results through a comprehensive and collaborative approach, while further strengthening the European urban mobility innovation ecosystem.</p><p>Taking into account the previous CIVITAS coordination and support action<sup>[1]</sup>, in collaboration with, and avoiding overlaps with, the Cities Mission Platform<sup>[2]</sup> and other relevant initiatives, the action is expected to address - in a clear and streamlined approach - all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Harvesting and spreading innovative urban mobility solutions, and speeding up the take-up of the related projects results by European cities by:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>setting up capacity building and a replication programme, to facilitate twinning, mutual learning and peer-to-peer exchanges, which should include cooperation with industry, SMEs and start-ups, while ensuring a feedback to policy loop;</li><li>optimising the common, user-friendly CIVITAS project evaluation framework, with dedicated support for its implementation by the projects that are part of the CIVITAS initiative;</li><li>optimising and promoting the CIVITAS website as the main knowledge and exchange platform for the European urban mobility community by means of digital tools and structured management approaches to disseminate information about the EU’s urban mobility research and innovation developments and results.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Developing and strengthening the urban mobility community in the EU and Associated Countries and actively engaging stakeholders across sectors and governance levels to facilitate common learning and exchange by:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>facilitating and supporting the Educational and Youth network,</li><li>facilitating and optimising the support to national CIVITAS networks (CIVINETS),</li><li>supporting R&amp;I projects’ clustering, and the coordination of living lab activities,</li><li>organising the CIVITAS Forum, and supporting the organisation of the Urban Mobility Days,</li><li>under guidance of the Commission services, organising the CIVITAS Politicians Exchange Forum,</li><li>facilitating the exchange between cities, urban public transport authorities and the industry, SMEs and start-ups,</li><li>enlarging the CIVITAS network.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>Since 2002 CIVITAS acts as an open platform that facilitates research, the uptake of innovative solutions, the validation of research results, the exchange of knowledge and best practices, and common learning in the area of urban mobility and transport. The project selected under this topic will help to ensure the long-term support for the R&amp;I urban mobility projects offering governance, and an organisational and logistical framework that guarantees the wide dissemination and take up of urban mobility project results.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://civitas.eu/coordination/muse\">CIVITAS MUSE | CIVITAS</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://netzerocities.eu/\">NetZeroCities</a></p>"

Local and regional authorities have an important role to play to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries.</p><p>In the EU, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L1936\">Road Infrastructure Safety Management (RISM) Directive</a> introduced the concept of network-wide road safety assessment (NWRSA) and the concept of proactive road safety assessment through the understanding of the in-built safety of roads. Considering safety at the network-level allows for an overview of the road safety performance instead of focusing on isolated parts of it, while the in-built safety assessment aims to identify parts of the road that have been omitted by crash-based analyses (such crash clusters or hotspot analysis) as they do not concentrate the majority of crashes, yet are crash-prone and/or uncomfortable to navigate. According to the provisions of the RISM Directive, a <a href=\"https://road-safety.transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/new-guidelines-assess-safety-road-infrastructure-2023-01-16_en\">methodology</a> has been developed to assess the network-wide safety of motorways and primary rural roads based on their combined crash-based and in-built safety assessments. While this is a first step in understanding road safety conditions on rural roads, secondary and lower-class roads are not covered and, at the same time, there is not adequate information on road user behaviour.</p><p>In an ageing society, cognitive and physical impairments pose an increasing threat to safe mobility. In rural areas, people with any kind of impairment or disability often lack alternatives to driving a car for their mobility needs. Addressing these issues will not only enhance road safety but also improve the quality of life and prevent the social exclusion of these people.</p><p>In addition to road safety issues, local and regional authorities manage risks associated with extreme weather phenomena and other natural disasters like floods, fires, storms or heavy snowfall. As these may affect safety and operations, relevant authorities need to adopt a more holistic resilience monitoring and response.</p><p>Research should support addressing these challenges by undertaking all the following actions in at least three regions covering both primary and secondary rural roads of adequate length to allow for region-level comparisons:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate the practical applicability of the NWRSA methodology and expand its use to all rural roads for an easy, low-cost, flexible and transparent, yet sufficiently accurate assessment of road infrastructure safety. Identify information gaps and propose methods to leverage available data to supplement the understanding of crash causation and outcomes.</li><li>Develop prevention strategies and measures to reduce fatalities and serious injuries in rural areas with a focus on high-risk locations and situations and on improving road user behaviour. This includes the development of reliable and easy-to-use methods to provide quantified indications of the actual crash risk associated with and the prevalence of risky behaviours. Based on this, enforcement measures with evidence-based effectiveness in addressing the problems and motivations underlying risky behaviour should be proposed, combining traditional methods with innovative enforcement approaches and new technologies, also taking into account the issue of multi-offenders[[<sup> </sup>A small group of repeat offenders account for a large share of crashes (e.g. 5% in population vs. 27% in crashes according to <a href=\"https://swov.nl/system/files/publication-downloads/r-2017-03.pdf\">SWOV 2017 Progressief boetestelsel</a>) and intoxication by drugs ( Recent studies show that the share of crash-involved drivers intoxicated by drugs equals or even surpasses those intoxicated by alcohol [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2023.2174801\">Gjerde &amp; Forst 2023</a>].]]. These enforcement measures, complemented by suitable awareness raising and nudging measures as well as novel incentive mechanisms to promote safe driving, will form building blocks to design integrated strategies fostering safer behaviour according to the local needs and specificities of rural areas. A gender and disability sensitive and intersectional approach, which intersects with other social factors, could be considered. Crash prevention strategies should also include countermeasures to reduce the effects of health-related risk factors and to guarantee at the same time the mobility of older people and persons with health impairments in rural areas.</li><li>Develop tools to make knowledge about climate-related risks easily accessible to local authorities and to enable them to take appropriate actions in order to maintain road safety and the resilience of the rural road network and of the infrastructure for road users even in extreme conditions<sup>[1]</sup>.</li> </ul><p>Projects should select those regions ensuring diversity in terms of road network design, geography and climate conditions, and road safety culture. At least two of those regions should be in countries with higher percentage of fatalities on rural roads than the EU average. The involvement of road authorities is strongly recommended.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Such tools may be based on results from projects under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11 (effects of disruptive changes in transport) as well as on other thorough analyses of how such situations were managed in the past and what can be improved.</p>"

However, these systems face challenges such as operational disruptions, safety and security risks, and evolving passenger demands.</p><p>In the context of passenger transport, resilience refers to the ability of a transport system to absorb disturbances, maintain its basic structure and function, and recover to a required level of service within acceptable time and cost after being affected by disruption. This involves implementing measures that ensure continuous operation, quick recovery from unexpected events, and adaptability to changing circumstances. Enhanced resilience is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring smooth functioning of transport systems and it is a cornerstone of the EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development and implementation of measures to enhance the resilience of urban, sub-urban and long-distance transport systems.</li><li>Leveraging digital technologies (e.g. big data, digital twins) and in particular generative and discriminative AI for anticipating and predicting the evolution of disruptions and their impacts, with real-time planning and information systems for minimizing impact and enabling faster recovery.</li><li>Use of innovative technologies for data acquisition and integrate data from various sources to inform decision-making and optimise strategies, and generate scenario libraries for different disruptive events and monitor the implementation of the response plans</li><li>Involve authorities and operators in the design process to create holistic solutions that are user-friendly and aligned with their needs.</li><li>Conducting safety and security assessments in data interpretation, ensuring decisions are based on objective factors while avoiding biases.</li><li>Test and validate the aspects above in real-life use cases in multimodal transport corridor within urban, sub-urban and long-distance passenger transport with minimum three transport modes per use cases (e.g. buses, metros, trams, trains, coaches, trolleybuses, ferries, share mobility) in at least three pilot sites situated in different Member States and reflecting a diversity of operational, geographic, and technological contexts. </li> </ul><p>Proposals are encouraged to building on results from previous calls on infrastructure and transport resilience (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-11, MG-7-1-2017, HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-09), multimodal traffic management (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-05, MG-2-11-2020), shared mobility and public transport (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-02-04, HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-02). Proposals should also comply with existing EU framework and strategies and building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the European mobility data space (EMDS). Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Detailed clustered collection of critical use cases and scenarios based on the findings of former or current national and international research projects, as well as the identification of missing aspects.</li><li>In-depth analysis of stakeholders that may be affected by critical situations and edge cases and that have high interest and/or influence in resolving these situations through their capabilities. </li><li>Availability of real-time holistic situation interpretation services addressing the respective needs of road users of all kinds, road operators, service providers and related perspectives, as well as its social participation and technological integration, i.e. the role of each technological component in the overall system-of-systems.</li><li>Availability of a “local deconflicting CCAM architecture” that detects and deconflicts corner case situations (automatically through active and passive technologies or by including remote operation techniques). This includes the capability from online calculation of optimal countermeasures to ensure safety, and reduce any negative impacts on all road users, by considering available infrastructure (including also automated and connected digital components, like sensors, intelligent traffic control systems, cooperative communication), and overall conditions. Such an architecture also needs to address relevant requirements, particularly in technology and near and far communications, outlining the technical standards and investments necessary for risk mitigation. These may include solutions to increase road users’ situational awareness and the provision of reliable, accurate and timely warnings.</li><li>Establishment of working methods and harmonization of interfaces with national/local road authorities, operators and emergency services (e.g. first responders in case of accidents), including remote operations and road enforcement. The aim must be the creation or adaption of decision-support tools that can be integrated with mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services. This also includes the definition of related shared governance models. Understanding of the requirements for public road authorities (national and local) to address CCAM critical cases, defining their role in supporting and enabling CCAM operations.</li><li>Enhanced user acceptance through holistic CCAM solutions addressing their individual needs and requirements as e.g. road user, customer, operator, service provider, etc., in terms of trust, safety, security, etc. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Based on the preliminary and final findings of HEADSTART<sup>[1]</sup>, SUNRISE<sup>[2]</sup>, EVENTS<sup>[3]</sup>, ROADVIEW<sup>[4]</sup> and SYNERGIES<sup>[5]</sup> (among others), this call is focussing on CCAM solutions for critical cases, specifically situations and events that are less regular and of higher risk. These cases may also include emergency conditions and unplanned events, on local and on larger (regional, national, European) scale, such as extreme weather conditions, road incidents, cyberattacks, traffic disruptions, and sudden loss of coverage of the Operational Design Domain (ODD).</p><p>CCAM operations may be disturbed under multiple scenarios, and can vary according to the type of road, road attributes, traffic conditions, available infrastructure and technology, malfunctions, incidents, etc. Depending on the specific circumstances and the dimension of the disturbance, the impact on CCAM operations and involved agents (e.g. road users, vehicles, VRUs, infrastructure components, emergency services, operators) may vary. According to the case and the dimension of the incident, different entities and actors of the CCAM system (and even beyond, e.g. regulatory bodies and emergency and crisis response centres) are involved and may need to take part to resolve these events in a resilient, safe and secure way.</p><p>This call adopts a holistic approach, investigating critical cases not only from technological/infrastructure or vehicle-related perspectives (e.g., edge cases for automated vehicles) but also from the viewpoint of the user, customer, service provider, authority, city, etc. In particular, the focus is on how the CCAM system addresses and mitigates potential negative consequences of such events, including safety risks, emissions, loss of trust, and similar impacts. Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of a clustered list of critical scenarios, impacted entities, role and relation of all stakeholders, the estimated impact and the optimal kind of CCAM-based countermeasure.</li><li>Development and testing of tools and services for the detection of critical situations and edge cases, also based on the tools and approaches for robust environment perception done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02.</li><li>Development and testing of CCAM-based countermeasure solutions. Where applicable, the use of artificial intelligence methods and digital infrastructure support should be considered, aligned also to the tools and approaches for robust decision making done in HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-02. The solutions also should reference common EU Emergency Response Protocols, e.g. for first responders. Also, the creation of decision-support tools and the integration of those into mobility platforms, traffic control systems, and emergency services must be considered. In general, customer/user understanding and trust in the CCAM system is crucial in the adoption of a new service. In building trust, it is vital to take into consideration the user perspective and investigate how critical cases can be managed in a way that is effective for the improvement of customer perception.</li><li>Validation and evaluation of solutions in terms of resulting risk reduction and potential negative impacts of critical cases. Solutions will need to be targeted against the scenarios identified and the stakeholders affected and would aim to either eliminate the risk to the service resilience or reduce its likelihood and impact as far as reasonably practicable. This also includes the quantification of the impact, which may also be deduced by using simulation. In addition, also the integration of the solutions into existing platforms needs to be validated in relevant environments (TRL 5). The outcomes of this call are expected to feed into future CCAM demonstrations.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are expected to build on the insights and outcomes of the CCAM Technology Observatory, exploring and leveraging complementarities between their own activities and the Observatory’s findings.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p>Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://www.headstart-project.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] https://ccam-sunrise-project.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] https://www.events-project.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] https://roadview-project.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] https://synergies-ccam.eu/</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>See the evaluation methodology <a href=\"https://www.connectedautomateddriving.eu/methodology/common-evaluation-methodology/\">here</a>.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Extended EU-wide Knowledge Base with tools supporting the safe and practical deployment of CCAM in Europe, identifying business needs and trends, including exploitation and maintenance plans to ensure the long-term availability and usage of the Knowledge Base. </li><li>Enhanced exchanges and cooperation among CCAM stakeholders (in particular public authorities, citizens and user groups) in Europe and with countries beyond Europe on R&amp;I and deployment topics of common interest.</li><li>Strengthened exchanges between EU Member States and Associated Countries and coordination with a possible future Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on CCAM as referred to in the Automotive Action Plan.</li><li>Accelerated implementation of practical safety assessment approaches and procedures from current validation projects across Member States and Associated Countries, reusing Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) concepts and respecting the specific integration aspects and legal conditions per MS. </li><li>A secure application exchange platform that enables applicants and Member States and Associated Countries to collaborate in obtaining open road-testing permits.</li><li>EU-wide federated scenario database<sup>[1]</sup> for the validation of CCAM systems linked to European in-depth accident databases. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Several coordination and stakeholder concertation tools have been established to support the alignment and international outreach of CCAM projects. The FAME project developed a European framework for CCAM testing, evaluation and data sharing and managed the EU-wide Knowledge Base that consolidates information related to CCAM R&amp;I and testing based on results from European and national projects, aiding researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals The platform will be extended in the project funded under the call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05<sup>[2]</sup> to address public authorities and citizens.</p><p>Regular events such as the European Conference on Connected and Automated Driving (EUCAD) and EUCAD symposia, international outreach activities and interactions with the Member States Advisory Group (SRG), extend the work of the CCAM Partnership and facilitate and support international dialogues to exchange knowledge and align activities across Europe and globally, at research and regulatory level.</p><p>The purpose of this exchange and alignment is to address and overcome barriers to the deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV) in Europe. Since 2022, Europe has introduced several regulatory developments aimed at facilitating the rollout of highly automated vehicles. The Implementing Act for Automated Driving Systems 2022/1426, the amendment to the Delegated Regulation 2022/2236 on type-approval, as well as the UNECE WP.29 Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) have all proposed frameworks and methods to ensure the safety of CCAM systems on the road. Despite these advances, a major challenge persists: the fragmented regulatory landscape for CCAM in Europe, which continues to hinder large-scale deployment. The FAME<sup>[3]</sup> and Hi-Drive<sup>[4]</sup> projects are working on recommendations for a harmonized open road-testing framework. Projects like HEADSTART<sup>[5]</sup>, SUNRISE<sup>[6]</sup>, and SYNERGIES are operationalizing the UNECE New Assessment/Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM) scenario-based approach. The project funded by call HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02<sup>[7]</sup> will extend the safety assurance framework (SAF) with ‘In-Service Monitoring and Reporting’ post-deployment. Coordination mechanisms are essential as Member States update regulations to align perspectives and support common approval procedures.</p><p>Proposed actions are expected to address the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Extend the EU Knowledge Base with practical tools that support safe deployment, not only supporting researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals, but also addressing public authorities and citizens, to establish and prepare the implementation of a long-term sustainability plan for structure.</li><li>Accelerate the exchange and cooperation between relevant European and international stakeholders, including Member States and Associated Countries, with the purpose to accelerate deployment. This by means of co-organizing high-level events such as the EUCAD conference and to coordinate with a large-scale cooperation (such as an IPCEI).</li><li>Develop and implement practical safety assessment procedures, as well as a framework for the secure exchange of applications for open road-testing permits across European Member States, with acknowledgement for specific MS regulations and context.</li><li>Support the realization of EU-wide federated scenario databases, with European in-depth accident databases.</li> </ul><p>The project funded under this topic is expected to continue the management and hosting of the CCAM Technology Observatory, including its database and content.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://synergies-ccam.eu/\">https://synergies-ccam.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203053</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069898\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069898</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006664\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006664</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824309\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824309</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069573\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069573</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203230\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203230</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals should address all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strategies, best practices and innovative solutions are made available to local authorities and actors to improve the availability, accessibility, and affordability of rural-urban transport and provide rural and urban populations in a vulnerable situation with better access to services and opportunities;</li><li>Integrated multimodal solutions, which ensure seamless transitions between rural and urban transport modes improving first- and last-mile connectivity, are piloted and related implementation plans are developed for/by local authorities and transport operators;</li><li>Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social group involved in or potentially affected by the R&amp;I development, thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake, and building trust in results and outcomes. Development of options for behavioural change towards healthier, safer and more sustainable mobility and lifestyles in rural and urban populations in a vulnerable situation.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>EU policies, such as the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the European Green Deal, emphasise the need for inclusive, efficient, accessible and sustainable transport systems that leave no one behind. Transport poverty refers to individuals’ and households’ inability or difficulty to meet the costs of private or public transport, or their lack of or limited access to transport needed for their access to essential socioeconomic services and activities. Considering the national and spatial context, transport poverty affects both rural and underserved urban areas. Addressing this challenge requires innovative multimodal transport solutions which integrate various modes efficiently, leveraging digitalisation, shared mobility, and demand-responsive transport to enhance affordability, reliability, and accessibility, thereby ensuring Mobility as a Right.</p><p>Proposals should address all the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building on the outcome of previous calls and existing knowledge (e.g. SMARTA-NET<sup>[1]</sup>, the study on Novel policy ideas for a shift to low-carbon mobility<sup>[2]</sup>, the study on Transport poverty: definitions, indicators, determinants, and mitigation strategies<sup>[3]</sup> and other relevant EU-funded projects<sup>[4]</sup>), and drawing on the feedback experience of existing innovative mobility solutions (e.g. SMARTA-NET Catalogue of rural shared mobility solutions<sup>[5]</sup>), investigate strategies to enhance availability and accessibility of sustainable and inclusive transport services in sparsely populated regions with limited transport options.</li><li>Analyse the demand for mobility services in regions and communities affected by transport poverty and investigate which drivers could facilitate transport users in a vulnerable situation (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport) to use public transport or other shared mobility options (including e.g. underutilised regional and secondary rail lines or feeder services to main rail corridors).</li><li>Develop new sustainable and inclusive integrated multimodal solutions that ensure seamless transitions between rural and urban transport modes, improving first- and last-mile connectivity. Solutions should focus on vulnerable and low-income households (including consideration of gender disparities in mobility and access to transport), and should combine, in an optimal (economic, social, environmental, and operational) way, the various modal transport offers to go beyond forced car ownership. Developing new digital platforms is out of the scope of this topic.</li><li>Each proposal must include pilot demonstrations in at least 4 pilot sites. The pilot demonstrations must cover 4 different areas across the EU and Associated Countries ensuring geographical balance and diversity of issues addressed (e.g. presence or not of transport services such as regional trains, frequency of services, population density). Each proposed issue must be addressed in at least two pilots. The pilots must be community-driven, carried out under the lead or with the involvement of rural/local/regional public authorities/administrations and the local transport authorities, and these entities must be included in the consortium as beneficiaries.</li><li>Elaborate and propose plans for a possible implementation of the developed and tested solutions by local authorities and transport authorities/operators.</li><li>Through the active engagement of public transport operators, local authorities, rural communities, and civil society organisations, through the European Rural Mobility Network (ERMN)<sup>[6]</sup>, elaborate a roadmap to implement and scaling up the tested solutions, while ensuring widespread adoption across diverse regional contexts.</li> </ul><p>Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[7]</sup> through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan.</p><p>If the proposed solutions use position, navigation, and/or timing (PNT) services or data, the beneficiaries must make use of Galileo (other GNSS may additionally be used). Where appropriate, Galileo services such as OSNMA (Open Service Navigation Message Authentication) and HAS (High Accuracy Service) should also be utilised.</p><p><u>This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot</u>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.</li><li>This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable designing inclusive transport systems that consider accessibility, equity, and digital literacy. Proposals should consider citizens engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and support.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.smarta-net.eu/\">https://www.smarta-net.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ae58bebf-b2b9-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1\">https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ae58bebf-b2b9-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b300f5f-b125-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b300f5f-b125-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1/language-en</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>Various shared mobility solutions have been demonstrated in multiple European projects, including , <a href=\"https://ruralsharedmobility.eu/smarta-2/\">SMARTA2</a>, <a href=\"https://projects2014-2020.interregeurope.eu/lastmile/\">LAST MILE</a>, <a href=\"https://interreg-baltic.eu/project/mamba/\">MAMBA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.interregeurope.eu/rural-mobility\">INCLUSION</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mara-mobility.eu/\">MARA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alpine-space.eu/project/melinda/\">MELINDA</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/769819\">Hi-Reach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.upperprojecteu.eu/\">UPPER</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spine-project.eu/\">SPINE</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://www.smarta-net.eu/solutions/\">Solutions – SMARTA-NET</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup><u><a href=\"https://www.smarta-net.eu/ermn/\">ERMN – SMARTA-NET</a></u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <a href=\"https://civitas.eu/resources?f%5B0%5D=project%3A49470&amp;f%5B1%5D=thematic-area%3A896\"> CIVITAS</a></p>"

Great benefit is expected through integration of PNT technology with rapidly emerging technologies, such as 5G/6G and Internet of Things (IoT). The aim is to investigate innovative solutions for PNT – including the impact on the regulatory framework, integrating advanced 5G technologies and IoT to act as complementary, redundant, secure and resilient navigation solutions for aviation, including UAS, in challenging environments.</p><p>The topic also addresses e-conspicuity, aiming to enhance pilot awareness notably at lower altitudes in U-space airspace in order to reduces collision risk in general aviation, where most small aircraft rely on see-and-avoid. Mobile telephony, with minimum network performance requirements, can provide a safe, affordable communication solution for U-space entry and flight safety.</p>"

It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation.

Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;</li><li>Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;</li><li>Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;</li><li>Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;</li><li>National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime. </li><li>Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns; </li><li>The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Proposals are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity;</li><li>address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate);</li><li>address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate.</li> </ul><p>Projects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available.</p><p>Production of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic.</p><p>The projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions.</p><p>The plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment and business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants.</p><p>An assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production. Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG emissions reduction potential; projects are encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>European energy security and industrial competitiveness are contested by the geopolitical circumstances and market situations around the world. Advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute to net-zero manufacturing in Europe. However, remaining challenges impacting the security of supply and competitiveness of these technologies and the integration of their value chains need to be clearly understood, presented, and mitigated.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Energy consumers benefit from the contribution to improved EU energy security and industrial competitiveness of renewable fuel technologies;</li><li>Energy producers and consumers benefit from the improved reliability, robustness and security of renewable fuel technologies (compared to existing ones);</li><li>Diverse stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industry, profit from the enhancement of common knowledge and understanding about existing opportunities of integrated value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;</li><li>Multi stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, technology developers, researchers, industrial and any other relevant stakeholders to the value chain, profit from the generation of multi benefits of promoting sustainable development and sustainable agriculture regarding climate change resilience and regenerative practices, accelerating renewable fuel innovation, and maximising carbon removals.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Projects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.</p><p>Competitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO<sub>2</sub> suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO<sub>2</sub> trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.</p><p>Value chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.</p><p>A sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.</p>"

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

They have to be critical for the overall reliability of the wind energy systems. For instance, in the case of floating offshore wind, these could be dynamic cables, moorings and connection systems (electrical and mechanical) and their interaction with complex ocean flows.</p><p>Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>Digitalisation plays a prominent role under various perspectives, for instance in terms of improved predictive maintenance activities and advanced sensors technologies for diagnostics, condition and health monitoring of the power electronics, and structural health assessment and monitoring.</p><p>Projects should aim at reducing downtime and operational costs, enhancing safety protocols for maintenance crews, and increasing the overall lifespan and efficiency of wind energy assets.</p><p>These solutions should be easily standardised and/or should take into account current standardisation efforts, notwithstanding the TRL level envisaged for the projects developed under this topic.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The EU’s Offshore Strategy<sup>[1]</sup> underlines that the deployment of offshore wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023)<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Our knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted<sup>[3]</sup>. However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.</p><p>Improving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR<sup>[4]</sup> in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;</li><li>The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;</li><li>Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;</li><li>Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;</li><li>Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;</li><li>Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;</li><li>Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;</li><li>Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;</li><li>Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;</li><li>Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. <u> The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project.</u> </li> </ul><p>Particular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures.</p><p>Complementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/restore-our-ocean-and-waters/european-digital-twin-ocean-european-dto_en\">European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO)</a> and its <a href=\"https://edito-infra.eu/\">core infrastructure</a>, for instance the projects funded under topics:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean;</li><li>HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;</li><li>HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06: Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection;</li><li>HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean;</li><li>HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms. </li> </ul><p>In addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics.</p><p>Environmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>COM(2020) 741 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52023DC0668\">COM (2023) 668 final - EUR-Lex - 52023DC0668 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>See for instance the ETC/ICM Report 2/2022: Mapping potential environmental impacts of offshore renewable energy, at: <a href=\"https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy\">https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.ospar.org/\">https://www.ospar.org/</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;</li><li>Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;</li><li>Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda<sup>[1]</sup>. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;</li><li>Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;</li><li>Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;</li><li>Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;</li><li>Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.</li><li>Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process.</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.</p><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf\">Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\"</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation. The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;</li><li>Increased module durability and reliability;</li><li>Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;</li><li>Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);</li><li>Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda<sup>[1]</sup>. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;</li><li>Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;</li><li>Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;</li><li>Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime.</li> </ul><p>Different locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf\">Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\"</a></p>"

The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.</p><p>The operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.</p><p>The EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects. </p><p>Proposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.</p><p>Activities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.</p><p>The proposed action is to be structured as following:</p><p><u>Preparation phase</u>: </p><p>Participating users/buyers of R&amp;D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8). </p><p>The procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to be necessarily tested at the same site.</p><p>At the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation of the lead procurer.</p><p><u>Execution phase</u>: </p><p>This phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts.</p><p>The procurement will be executed as a single joint procedure in which different lots can be considered. The research and specification works are expected to lead to at least two commercial scale demonstrators tested for at least 12 months in a commercially representative site during the action duration following the IEA-OES<sup>[1]</sup> stage-gate metrics. </p><p>Results will be shared with the European industry to accelerate the technology development and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of knowledge creation. At the end of the action, at least one of the demonstrators is expected to be ready for testing in an operational environment at commercial scale. </p><p>At the end of the action, designs are expected to be ready to proceed to Stage 5 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas (Commercial-scale array demonstration).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>IEA-OES: International Energy Agency – Ocean Energy Systems</p>"

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).</p><p>This Destination contributes directly to the Strategic Plan’s <strong>Key Strategic Orientations</strong> ‘<em>Green transition</em>’, ‘<em>Digital transition</em>’ and ‘<em>A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe</em>’.</p><p>In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall <strong>expected impact </strong>of this Destination is to contribute to the <em>‘Ensuring more sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through solutions for smart energy systems based on renewable energy solutions’</em>.</p><p>This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.</p><p><strong>The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are:</strong></p><p><em><u>Renewable energy</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Energy producers have access to competitive European renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies and deploy them to enhance the EU’s energy security. This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage.

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

The cooperation platform should be based on a plug-and-play integration of the energy community eco-system components (hardware and software), using and extending relevant communication standards and data models. The integration mechanism should be embedded within the core systems used by customers/prosumers, DSO (and TSO), aggregators and market operators, fully aligned with SGAM;</li><li>Develop tailored security solutions for private and public communication networks used by IoT apps and devices (smart appliances) across energy carriers;</li><li>Ensure the follow-up and implementation of EU policy measures, including by conducting quality assessments and introducing national community energy targets;</li><li>Foster institutional allies at local and regional levels;</li><li>Provide access to and capacities for using digital planning tools;</li><li>Identify the barriers for network operators (e.g. legal, economic, regulatory etc.) who want to introduce smart consumption options for their customers.</li> </ul><p>Preferably semantically interoperable interactions, as enabled by the ETSI SAREF ontologies, are used. Furthermore, the project should follow the IEC TR 63097 Smart Grid Roadmap, and where relevant, the developed solutions should be open for off-shelf integration using common communication and data standards.</p><p>The project should benefit from the direct participation of energy communities, smart appliances manufacturers, home energy devices manufacturers, home and building energy management system developers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), and aggregators.</p><p>However, in order to comply with Article 33, 36 and 54 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, TSOs or DSOs participating in this project should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities or recharging points for electric vehicles. Moreover, the role of the distribution system operator in facilitating peer to peer trading should be without prejudice to the rules in Article 35 Directive (EU) 2019/944.</p><p>The developed solutions have to be tested within, at least, three energy communities from different European countries, preferably in regions with different socio-economic development contexts and different resource availabilities. Technical and social characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions' credibility. The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems.</p><p>In order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities.</p><p>The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively participate in its activities. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g., clusters of digital projects and coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant.</p><p>In particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p>"

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

This will contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li>Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies.</li><li>Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li>European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations.</li><li>European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy.</li><li>European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.<strong><em> </em></strong>Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty.</li><li>Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal. </li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids &amp; storage</u></em></p><p>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.</p><p>Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system.</p><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em> </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide removal technologies (including conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to energy products).</li><li>Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate. </li> </ol>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years and to their simple installation. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, a surge in the number of end-of-life (EOL) PV modules is expected, of which crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV is the main type. It would therefore be beneficial to improve the eco-design and sustainability of silicon-based solar cells and modules, by reducing the use of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs), revalorising the use of recycled silicon waste, adopting recyclable/repairable module designs and extending their lifetime without compromising their reliability and durability.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Ultra-low carbon footprint and reduced environmental impact PV cells/modules through lifetime extension, Ag or In free, and with designs that allow recyclability and repairability;</li><li>Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;</li><li>Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Extend module lifetime up to 40 years with extreme weather resilience;</li><li>Develop cell/module architectures/designs including recycled content, without In or Ag and without harmful substances (Pb, F, etc.) but without compromising their quality and reliability;</li><li>Develop module designs with improved recyclability and repairability;</li><li>Develop adapted testing methodologies and recycling standards;</li><li>Provide technical solutions for PV module repair in the field to extend lifetime;</li><li>Determine the environmental benefits of recycling precious metals. </li> </ul><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households).

While IPV technologies represent a major opportunity for the European energy transition, unlocking a greater potential for solar PV, it is challenging to bring new products to the market due to the lack of availability of suitable infrastructure to demonstrate technically and economically innovative technologies at scale. In addition, as IPV components are not as standardised and present much greater technological, material and size variability than conventional modules, dedicated recycling and material recovery processes need to be demonstrated.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Increase the potential for commercialisation of IPV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;</li><li>Increase recyclability and minimise the environmental impact of IPV;</li><li>Introduce new business models and open new markets in IPV manufacturing, reuse and recycling;</li><li>Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Suitable IPV manufacturing, technically and economically innovative technologies at scale;</li><li>Flexible IPV production pilot lines to test the 100kWp+ scale (with linked demonstration sites);</li><li>Demonstration of recycling processes for various sizes, materials and technologies of IPV products (BIPV/IIPV, agriPV, VIPV, floating…). </li> </ul><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Develop and/or update relevant models and simulation tools;</li><li>Develop and demonstrate innovative grid control and grid-forming solutions that leverage the capabilities of GFIs with the view to enable mass deployment of GFIs;</li><li>Address use cases for both transmission- and distribution-level grids, ranging from applications used in residential and commercial domains up to the use in large RES generators (PV or wind) and grid-scale battery storage systems. They could also consider solutions that include LVDC microgrids that are connected to the main AC grids;</li><li>Take a system-wise approach, including control strategies that can effectively encompass wider areas; </li><li>Develop interoperability between different solutions and products from different GFI manufacturers. Devise standardised approaches through the use of hardware in the loop and advanced simulation models for GFIs;</li><li>Leverage modern solutions, including digital twins and artificial intelligence. Use and/or develop, to the greatest extent possible, open-source software solutions and or software modules.</li><li>Develop a manual and propose best practices on this matter to be used by TSOs and DSOs. Propose sets of standardised technical requirements for GFIs, test models and procedures for verification of compliance (for the use of TSOs and DSOs) Identify remaining gaps and further needs for research and development. Suggest market conditions and/or opportunities that would incentivise the deployment at scale of GFIs. </li> </ul><p>The demonstration, test and validation of the activities must be carried out in at least two pilots in different EU Member States or Associated Countries. The pilots are expected to address diverse solutions (including voltage levels and geographical landscapes).</p><p>Projects are expected to include at least: one electricity TSO, two DSOs, one provider of technology that includes GFIs, one RES-based energy producer, and one university and/or research organisation. </p><p>Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>one or more suppliers of GFIs, with the aim to cover the whole range of products intended to be connected to both transmission and distribution voltage levels;</li><li>at least one grid-scale battery storage system operator</li><li>at least one aggregator that manages distributed energy resources that include GFIs. </li> </ul><p>This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not necessarily apply per each pilot in particular.</p><p>Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative<sup>[1]</sup> and actively participate in its activities.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research infrastructures<sup>[2]</sup>, as well as related projects offering access to research infrastructures in the electricity grid domain- particularly RISEnergy<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Mediterranean countries other than the EU and with Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\">https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website <a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] RISE Energy- <a href=\"https://risenergy-project.eu/\">Homepage -</a></p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households).

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).</p><p>This Destination contributes directly to the Strategic Plan’s <strong>Key Strategic Orientations</strong> ‘<em>Green transition</em>’, ‘<em>Digital transition</em>’ and ‘<em>A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe</em>’.</p><p>In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall <strong>expected impact </strong>of this Destination is to contribute to the <em>‘Ensuring more sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through solutions for smart energy systems based on renewable energy solutions’</em>.</p><p>This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.</p><p><strong>The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are:</strong></p><p><em><u>Renewable energy</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li><strong>Energy producers</strong> have access to efficient and competitive European renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies with a solid knowledge base and are able to deploy them to enhance the EU’s energy security and reach its climate neutrality objectives, in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</li><li><strong>Technology providers</strong> have access to European, competitive, resilient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, and with strong export potential to supply both the EU internal and global markets. They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies.

This system will enable proactive and adaptive management of storage and flexibility assets (e.g. large industrial plants with flexible electricity demand), ensure seamless integration with existing grid infrastructures (if applicable also with offshore systems) and electricity markets while enhancing system efficiency and resilience (also for rare/extreme events). The project will demonstrate real-time management for optimal energy dispatch, ancillary services and storage cycling, develop a scalable integration framework for seamless cross-border operability, and validate improvements in grid reliability through field demonstrations and simulations, providing a potential blueprint for EU-wide deployment. Proof of concept studies using PHIL technology applied to scaled systems are expected to be used for the proactive and adaptive management algorithms.</p><p>Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative <sup>[1]</sup> and actively participate in its activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\">https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/</a></p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households).

Solutions should address challenges specific to off-grid or non-interconnected area contexts, including storage scale, compromised grid interaction, resilience to potential shortages of critical materials, and multi-energy needs (electricity, heating, cooling). Emphasis should be on robustness and error-freeness, while considering sustainability, efficiency and performance. The project should foresee these solutions for using real-world critical infrastructures through simulation and experiments and establishing a procedure for decision-making, focusing on energy security and resilience against high-impact, low-probability events, by ensuring operational efficiency both on-grid and off-grid. Where relevant, interdependencies among critical infrastructures and system redundancy should be considered.</p><p>Projects are encouraged to support the reconstruction of Ukraine by including Ukrainian beneficiaries.</p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Innovations in machine learning forecasting can help balance energy systems and enable active participation in a decentralized, resilient, and digitalized European energy landscape, optimizing self-consumption and reducing energy costs for consumers.</p><p><u>This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of R&amp;I activities to societal needs and concerns.</li><li>This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities.</li> </ul><p>Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative <sup>[1]</sup> and actively participate in its activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\">https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/</a></p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

Injection tests can be done with water only to reduce cost and testing duration, although this could possibly (but not necessarily) be complemented by water with CO2 (or N2) to determine the reservoir injectivity with different phases.</li><li>Cooperate with a national competent authority to ensure support in terms of the selection of the priority target formations and to have access to existing subsurface data. Demonstrate how the test site has been identified, and that CO2 storage is legally possible in the designated area.</li><li>Test sites must be in a saline aquifer at a minimal depth of 800 m, in a geologically stable area, with minimal faulting and fracturing, that provide significant scalable storage capacity (proven confinement, limited heterogeneity, and with favourable porosity and permeability and porosity), and are expected to gain the necessary permits, following the appraisal and testing. The geological conditions of the site should be defined in term of risks as it is in the Directive, that is, proposed site must demonstrate, in line with existing data, that prior analysis shows that, under the proposed conditions of use, there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.</li><li>Tests should be designed as to allow a reliable quantification of the injectivity index. Test duration should be optimised to achieve a representative pressure transient response.</li><li>The Horizon Europe grant can support all data acquisition, processing and interpretation, modelling, the drilling, completion and logging of the test well, the injectivity test, and the measuring &amp; monitoring technologies.

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

It could cover, for example, catalyst development, renewable energy storage systems, integration of renewable energy technologies into a single energy generation system, hybrid renewable energy systems, heating &amp; cooling systems, fuels production systems, (direct) solar fuels and solar driven chemical processes, hybrid electricity generation solutions between different renewable energy sources, direct utilization of renewable energy sources.</p><p>The following areas are excluded from the scope of the topic as they fall within the scope of partnerships or other calls:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Hydrogen production through electrolysers.</li><li>Fuel cells.</li><li>Basic material research.</li><li>Batteries.</li> </ul><p>The proposal is expected to establish technological feasibility of its concept through a robust research methodology, at least TRL 4 or at most TRL 5. The concept could be based on a new solution or on the improvement of an existing high-risk and high<s> </s>return solution. Technology transfer from sectors other than energy should be considered whenever relevant, as it may provide ideas, experiences, technology contributions, knowledge, skills, and new approaches.</p><p>For bioenergy or biofuel concepts, whenever the direct use of biogenic waste is considered, resource availability and treatment will be taken into account from the design stage.</p><p>In developing its concept, the proposal is expected to address the following related aspects: lower environmental impact, minimise impacts on biodiversity and protected species and habitats, reduced pollution, better resource efficiency (materials, geographical footprints, water, etc…). Whenever risks have been identified, mitigation measures need to be presented.</p><p>The proposal is expected also to present a comparison with current commercial renewable energy technologies and/or solutions to show its advantages in terms of expected economic performance, environmental impact (notably on biodiversity and pollution), energy security, competitivity and industrial independence<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Selected projects are expected to consider the drivers behind social acceptance and trust-building of the technological solution and assess the best way to promote local involvement as part of ensuring a just transition (gender, cultural and socio-economic factors should be accounted for). An analysis of policy approaches that are encompassing (policy mixes), adaptive (policy learning) and context sensitive (working for different places, levels and/or sectors) should also be performed in order to support the deployment of the future new technology.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research infrastructures<sup>[2]</sup>, as well as related projects offering access to research infrastructures in the clean energy domain- particularly RISEnergy<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] For an example of methodology for the assessment of sustainability, circularity and contribution to EU resilience and technological autonomy of clean energy technology in the R&amp;I pipeline, please see <a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-publications/study-circular-approaches-sustainable-and-affordable-clean-energy-transition_en\">Study on circular approaches for a sustainable and affordable clean energy transition</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed from ESFRI website <a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>RISE Energy- <a href=\"https://risenergy-project.eu/\">Homepage -</a></p>"

They benefit also from circular renewable energy technologies that are safe and sustainable by design with reduced and diversified external dependence on critical raw materials<sup>[1]</sup>.</li><li><strong>Economic sectors</strong> benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions that are, among others, competitive, cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and sustainable. Such integration is facilitated through digitalisation and integration of artificial intelligence of renewable energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability.</li><li><strong>European industries</strong> benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international partnerships, and become more competitive in innovative renewable energy technologies in Europe and globally.</li><li><strong>European researchers</strong> benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies including emerging ones, also through international collaborations.</li><li><strong>European citizens </strong>have access to an energy market that is fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels imports. Citizens experience less fuel and energy poverty, and also benefit from new employment and upskilling opportunities. Local communities benefit from a more decentralized, affordable, and secure energy system and from multiple uses of land and water.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>R&amp;I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system through <strong>advanced solutions</strong> for accelerating the <strong>energy systems integration and decarbonisation</strong>. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the energy system <strong>work better for actors</strong> and supply <strong>more reliable, resilient and secure energy</strong> – even under increasingly more frequent extreme climate events.</li><li>The solutions developed will contribute to <strong>increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables </strong>through optimizing cross sector integration and grid scale storage as well as cover off-grid situations. They will improve the preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% renewables in the gross final energy consumption (with the aspiration to reach 45%), and full decarbonisation by 2050. They will <strong>enable</strong> <strong>further electrification of demand </strong>and will enhance the <strong>competitiveness of the European value chain</strong>, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) and decrease dependencies. Such solutions would also enable a better EU resilience to climate risks.</li><li>The solutions will <strong>improve consumer awareness and engagement</strong> in the energy transition, via innovative offers and services (e.g. demand response, energy communities) and will target different types of consumers, including “hard to reach” population groups (such as energy poor or low-income households). This will result in increased trust in, and uptake of the new products and services entering the energy system.</li> </ol><p><em><u>Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</u></em></p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Accelerated deployment of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and/or in industry applications, as well as carbon dioxide removal for negative emissions.</li> </ol><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in both Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) and Innovation Actions (IAs) falling under this destination.

The R&amp;I activities are divided into three challenges:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Breakthrough challenge</li><li>Validation challenge</li><li>Demonstration challenge</li> </ol><p>The breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities.</p><p>The breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new and potentially disruptive solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the wind energy sector and on the acceleration of wind energy deployment at scale both off- and onshore, including with experimental proof of concept, as well as with validation both in laboratory and relevant environment, as appropriate. Concepts and technologies initially developed through the breakthrough challenge could be further matured through the validation challenge.</p><p>The validation challenge entails actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions, both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment that have been developed in the project but also developed previously and separately in other European and national projects. For the validation, the project can consider different use cases (e.g. onshore, offshore).</p><p>The demonstration challenge entails demonstration activities to accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry, in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan (activities up to TRL 7-8). It will solely be implemented by the core consortium.</p><p>The total maximum amount of EU funding for the demonstration activities is expected to be 50 million Euros.</p><p>The project is expected to implement at least 3 demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The proposed solutions should be demonstrated for a continuous period of at least 6 months.</p><p>The project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone, for each demonstration activity, before entering the deployment phase. Before each go/no-go milestone, the project is expected to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans, compliant with the applicable standards and iii) a complete business and implementation plan. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project proposal is also expected to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this, the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.</p><p>Privileged research and innovation areas for the demonstration challenge are the ones listed from a. to f. in the scope: a. industrialisation, scale-up and competitiveness, b. optimisation and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance, c. wind energy system integration, d. sustainability and circularity, e. floating offshore wind and f. research and technology infrastructures for wind energy.</p><p><em><u>Activities directly implemented by the core consortium</u></em></p><p>The activities of the core consortium are expected to include the implementation of direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects). It is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.</p><p><em>Activities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)</em></p><p>A share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to support research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.</p><p>The use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, attracting different stakeholders and innovators to develop and validate new technological solutions in the wind sector and respond quickly to new challenges. A tiered approach to address complex R&amp;I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&amp;I work can continue without major interruption.</p><p>The demonstration challenge is excluded from FSTP calls.</p><p>For the FSTP calls, the following should be taken into account:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of the long-term R&amp;I challenges. Up to 8 million EUR of the EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The FSTP breakthrough challenge should aim at attracting innovative entities that does not necessarily have the capacity to apply directly for EU grants.</li><li>Validation challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&amp;I projects. Up to 16 million EUR of the EU requested contribution is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.</li> </ol><p>The first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP calls for the validation challenge must be published in a later stage considering the experience and the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core project R&amp;I activities. The duration of the actions supported by FSTP should not be longer than 18 months.</p><p>The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.</p><p>For the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.</p><p>The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.</p><p>Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p><strong><u>Governance of the project</u></strong></p><p>The project will have to set out how and with what frequency the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.</p><p>The core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.</p><p>The project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in wind energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Wind Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership related initiative and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advises the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET Plan activities and goals. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.</p><p>The proposal should define mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), benchmarking and progress monitoring). Besides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the wind energy sector<sup>[4]</sup>. The project should report the progress of all its R&amp;I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.</p><p>The consortium will have to present a clear risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.</p><p>In the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges and actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). A given action supported by such FSTP scheme can be implemented by one third party or a by consortium of entities.</p><p>As regards data management, in addition to fulfilling the standard research data management and open access requirements in line with the Grant Agreement provisions, the project is expected to set up a platform, possibly re-using an already existing one, to ensure the accessibility and maintenance of the data generated by the project. The platform should be able to organise and host data generated by other research and innovation projects on wind energy. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable)</p><p>The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&amp;D community.</p><p><em>Cooperation with International Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) on wind energy systems</em></p><p>For activities carried out that are also covered by relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Cooperation Programme for wind energy systems<sup>[5]</sup>, proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.</p><p><em>Duration</em></p><p>The estimated project duration is around 5 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>See for instance: <a href=\"https://etipwind.eu/files/file/agendas/230061-Etipwind-SRIA-final-web.pdf\">ETIP Wind Strategic Research &amp; Innovation Agenda 2025-2027 - November 2023</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>See for instance: <a href=\"https://eera-wind.eu/component/attachments/attachments.html?task=attachment&amp;id=1754\">NeWindEERA – A New Research Programme for the European Wind Energy Sector – September 2024</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] European Commission (2025), <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/other/guidance_fstp-good-practices_en.pdf\">Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] ETIP Wind, EERA JP Wind and IWG Wind (2025); “From innovation to industrial competitiveness – How wind R&amp;I funding will deliver European technology sovereignty”.

As the topic envisages subsequent FSTP calls to progressively develop a given solution, the maximum amount to be granted to each party needs to be sufficiently high to cater for cases where a given legal entity may receive more than one FSTP grant.</p></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>described in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-15-general-annexes_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annex G</a> of the Work Programme General Annexes.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><h4>Specific conditions</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>described in the [specific topic of the Work Programme]</p></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-ria-ia_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE RIA, IA)</a></p><p><strong>Evaluation form templates</strong> <em>— will be used with the necessary adaptations</em> </p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/ef/ef_he-ria-ia_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard evaluation form (HE RIA, IA)</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Guidance</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/programme-guide_horizon_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE Programme Guide</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Call-specific instructions</strong>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/information-on-financial-support-to-third-parties_he_en.docx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information on financial support to third parties (HE)</a>&#xa0;</p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-1-general-introduction_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE Main Work Programme 2026-2027 – 1.

Proposals should steer the development of these technologies at EU level and bring them to the market. Pre-commercial procurement of R&amp;D, validation and possibly, first deployment of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies is considered an effective tool to de-risk such activities and overcome the “valley of death” because real take off by engaging primarily concerned contracting entities is expected. The scope of this action is to design and bring industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies at TRL 8 by the action end. The competitive development in phases of entire industrial value chains should built upon existing knowledge on technology and value chain readiness based on existing EU projects and studies, thus speeding up the de-risking. </p><p>‘Transnational buyers’ could be public plus possibly one or more private procurers, and that provide similar services of public interest. The buyers will collectively develop and implement the pre-commercial procurement of R&amp;D services from a number of providers and designate a lead procurer to award the contracts. The procurement must be open to providers of R&amp;D services established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.</p><p>Inclusiveness of a broad range of public and private procures across EU and Associated Countries and across national borders is encouraged, to effectively share the risk and benefit from creating in the EU market readiness of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies. Public and private EU airport and port authorities and their respective managing bodies, aircraft operators and shipping companies, other state, regional or local authorities and bodies governed by public law or their associations, are some examples of expected public<sup>[1]</sup> and private procurers with an incentive to improve solutions in areas of public interest, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply as fuels. </p><p>The consortium is encouraged to plan activities during the project to raise awareness to the R&amp;D providers that will win PCP contracts about unlocking and increasing their investment capacity in the field of renewable fuel technologies, for example by using possible combinations of the PCP procurement contract with additional support for companies from the EIC, InvestEU, regional funds or possibly other sources of Union funding. Participation of public contracting authorities and entities managing or funding such funds in the project is encouraged. In addition, the procurers should include in the proposal what will be their planned approach for deployment in case the PCP results in successful solutions; this could be through a combination of deploying a limited set of solutions already during the PCP project and/or foreseeing a deliverable that prepares follow-up procurement to purchase (larger volumes of) such type of solution(s) after the PCP.</p><p>Essential value chains to de-risk should be based on identified technologies by our studies<sup>[2]</sup> (i) – vii) below) as those that can contribute essentially to domestic commercial fuel production<strong> </strong>beyond 2030, and possibly other that can be demonstrated at commercial scale by the end of the execution phase of the project<sup>[3]</sup>: </p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li>Production of advanced bioEthanol and further processing into ATJ-SPK</li><li>Biomass Gasification and FT-Synthesis to produce FT-SPK</li><li>Production of BioMethanol for further processing into MTJ</li><li>Hydrotreatment of Lipids from marginal/contaminated lands to produce HEFA</li><li>Biomass Pyrolysis and Upgrading or co-processing to produce biokerosene and bio-heavy fuel oil</li><li>Biomethane from AD and Gasification and Methanation to produce biomethane for shipping or further processing into methanol (methanolysis) for shipping</li><li>E-Methanol production from CO2 and renewable H2 for shipping </li> </ol><p>Industrial value chains of the essential renewable fuel technologies should be developed based on domestic sustainable feedstocks across EU and Associated Countries and on also creating synergies across all end use energy and transport sectors for markets and production facilities for renewable fuels.</p><p>Hydrogen production as end-product is not in scope.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Public contracting authorities and entities as defined in REGULATION (EU) 2021/695, Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>a) <a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/funding-opportunities/calls-tenders/study-development-outlook-necessary-means-build-industrial-capacity-drop-advanced-biofuels_en\">Study on Development of Outlook for the Necessary Means to Build Industrial Capacity for Drop-in Advanced Biofuels - European Commission</a>, b) <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/tender-details/ea9c3f42-1c01-4fb6-9bdb-d361c89aa52d-CN?order=DESC&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;sortBy=startDate&amp;keywords=industrialcapacity&amp;isExactMatch=true&amp;cftPartyLegalEntityId=47352464\">How To Mobilize Industrial Capacity Building For Advanced Biofuels</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>All hydrogen used to the production of the synthetic fuels should comply with the EU legislation on the renewable and low carbon methodology, i.e. the processes of Steam Methane Reforming using fossil fuels for the production are out of the scope, as there is no RI associated to these methods.</p>"

For this purpose, the extraction of residues should respect locally defined retention thresholds for deadwood extraction and exclude negative impacts on soil quality and soil carbon</p><p>To minimise possible local ecosystem interferences, biomass fuels from residues and wastes are expected to be the primary feedstock of the high-efficiency CHP plant. The biomass fuels are expected to be produced with the use of innovative preprocessing and upgrading technologies and through the adoption of advanced supply chains from a mixture of residues and wastes and exclude negative impacts not only overall, but in each individual harvest location, which results in specific operational, economic and logistical and supply chain challenges to be addressed. Proposals should foresee at least one regional value chain demonstration including use of the solid biofuel with verified quality and occurring GHG and air-pollutant reduction in an operational high efficiency CHP plant. Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of feedstock providers (e.g. farmers, foresters, municipalities) to strengthen their position in the value chains relevant for this topic.</p><p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate ways for future efficient, cost-effective, robust, resilient and low pollution CHP plants (including retrofitting and excluding co-firing with fossil fuels) in a local industrial context.</p><p>Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. In this respect, collaboration with suitable networks like e.g. bioenergy clusters should be envisaged to avoid the development of overly site-specific solutions and to enhance replicability. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG and air pollutant emissions reduction potential; projects will be encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs including the overall industrial ecosystem at the place of deployment. Projects are encouraged to support the reconstruction of Ukraine by covering regional value chains in Ukraine and/or Ukrainian beneficiaries.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, SSH research should look specifically at how synergies can be enhanced to achieve the topic’s objective in respect of socioeconomic sustainability. A gender-sensitive and intersectional approach can inform the development of inclusive solutions in solid biofuel supply and CHP, by identifying specific needs, developing solutions that address these needs, and monitoring their impacts on diverse groups.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Deep sedimentary/basement reservoirs are usually characterized by low permeability, high drilling cost and a scarcity of data, as they are typically ignored by hydrocarbon exploration. Major exploration challenges relate to predicting deep sedimentary and basement reservoir structures and properties to identify suitable locations for reservoir-independent approaches, capable of overcoming the low permeability obstacle, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) or closed-loop geothermal systems.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased knowledge base for developers to unlock unexploited geothermal resources, increase drilling success rate, increase geothermal sources performance and reduce the risk of induced seismicity and deploy geothermal energy in a sustainable way in environmental (notably on biodiversity and pollution) and socioeconomic terms.</li><li>Citizens and local communities are engaged and benefit from local, more secure and affordable renewable energy sources.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Advanced methods, technologies and conceptual models, for different geological settings, to identify suitable conditions for geothermal resource exploitation, tackling the issue of data scarcity and leveraging the information available. The proposals are expected to contribute to the assessment of environmental and social impacts and to unlock geothermal resources marked by low natural permeability at depths between 2000-6000m.</p><p>The scope covers advances beyond the state of the art in equipment, methods and models capable of providing in-depth understanding and predictive power for properties and processes beyond conventional depths. The proposals are expected to take into account the impact of reservoir conditions and parameters (i.e. in-situ stress, temperature, geo-mechanical, chemical properties) on the development and performance of the geothermal resources, covering, when relevant, aspects such as the suitability for different stimulation techniques, well designs and completion technologies, the possibilities for the coproduction of raw materials, wellbore stability.</p><p>The proposals are expected to validate the benefit of the proposed solution in the context of state-of-the-art decision and risk analysis methods.</p><p>To ensure trust building and communities’ support, partners are expected to practice inclusive societal engagement, which is early, continuous, and sensitive to the technical specificities (e.g. impact on biodiversity, water balance, pollution, land occupation, visual impact, noise as well as geo-mechanical changes (e.g. seismicity) and underground changes (e.g. disturbance of non-targeted aquifers)) that could affect local communities and ecosystems <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><span style=\"color:black\">For an example of a methodology for the assessment of sustainability, circularity and contribution to the EU resilience and technological autonomy of clean energy technology in the R&amp;I pipeline, please see </span><a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-publications/study-circular-approaches-sustainable-and-affordable-clean-energy-transition_en\">Study on circular approaches for a sustainable and affordable clean energy transition</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Agrivoltaics or the co-location of agricultural activity and PV electricity production is a novel form of PV deployment which could provide farmers with diversified revenue sources and ecological benefits, while reducing land use competition, siting restrictions or adverse impacts on biodiversity and agricultural production. Optimizing system designs and business practices will help to enable simultaneous land use creating synergy for both agriculture and electricity production; this can benefit farmers, lower PV costs and enable the European Union to reach the goals of the EU solar energy strategy.</p><p>Similarly, offshore/nearshore PV systems represent a tremendous deployment potential in Europe and globally, due to their advantages in conserving land resources and optimizing light utilization. However, prevailing technical challenges limit deployment in most sea conditions usually found in Europe.</p><p>Project results are therefore expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, depending on the proposed system (agriPV or offshore/nearshore PV): </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Harvesting of crops and photovoltaic electricity, providing sustainable solutions for energy production/use/efficiency, soil and biodiversity protection and water conservation.</li><li>Reinforce the European PV value chain, introduce new business models and open new markets for novel, bankable agri or offshore/nearshore PV systems.</li><li>Minimise the impact of PV on landscape/sea and environment exploiting its modularity and synergies of use. Promote offshore wind and PV co-location and system integration.</li><li>Significant improvement of designs that reduce both CAPEX and OPEX, maximize energy output and thus reduce LCoE.</li><li>Promote integrated and multi-dimensional policy design to overcome socio-technical challenges for agri and offshore/nearshore PV deployment. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address only one of the two areas (agriPV or offshore/nearshore PV). They are expected to demonstrate:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A comprehensive (system) modelling for an accurate and reliable energy yield assessment with comparable methodologies for biodiversity, plant-yield and quality in the case of agriPV, as well as power generation.</li><li>Advanced system components and system concepts/architectures of adequate scale that minimise impact on land/sea/environment while maximizing energy output/optimising connection to the grid.</li><li>Resilience and adaptation of the systems to climate change impacts (extreme events, or in the case of agriPV, changing agricultural practices and/or crops choices, etc.).</li><li>Standardisation for module and structure design for these applications.</li><li>Permitting process definition.</li><li>System demonstrators of adequate scale (min 5 MW altogether) at different EU climate/sea zones.</li> </ul><p>Achieving societal acceptance and sustainability in agriPV development requires clarity in permitting procedures, promoting energy justice principles, mitigating agronomic risks, and balancing economic development with environmental conservation (notably biodiversity). These dimensions need to be addressed holistically with the involvement of policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities working towards a just and equitable deployment of agriPV. In the case of offshore/nearshore PV, aesthetic appreciation, as well as possible conflicts of interest related to water areas (with e.g., commercial shipping, fishing, sand extraction, military use, and recreational sailing) or colocation should be looked at.</p><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation as well as a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

Projects are expected to focus on developing, training and testing AI foundation models, using extensive data sets to accelerate the energy transition in key focus areas of the energy sector. Projects are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building on the results of previously funded projects on the Common European energy data space<sup>[1]</sup> as well as the ongoing work within the Data 4 Energy expert group, projects are expected to demonstrate innovative methods and data governance strategies for sharing data among various energy actors. Projects are expected to demonstrate that they have access to large relevant datasets at the time of submitting the proposal.</li><li>Projects are expected to develop innovative strategies for sharing data in an effective, secure and transparent way to support the development of AI foundation models. An indicative non exhaustive list of strategies that can be explored is the use of data space connectors or federated training of models to allow the integration of confidential data; the creation of synthetic data as an intermediate step to fill data gaps or improve the quality of the data could also be explored. Projects could also explore other innovative data sharing strategies, such as an ‘AI gym’. The data governance strategies that will be developed in the project should be designed in a way to be scalable and operational even after the end of the project.</li><li>Projects are expected to develop foundation models tailored for the energy sector, addressing at least one -or more- of the following use cases: planning and operation of electricity grids (including static power flow modelling and dynamic EMT modelling), forecasting, congestion management, anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, flexibility management, demand-side energy efficiency, smart and bidirectional charging of EVs or other use cases that contribute to the objective of digitalisation of the energy system.</li><li>Projects are expected to perform in-depth testing and validation of developed foundation models in lab demonstrators and real-life pilots, building on the results and using the facilities of previously funded projects on “AI testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)”<sup>[2]</sup>. Regulatory sandboxes could also be considered for real-life pilot implementations.</li><li>Projects are expected to bring together a wide group of stakeholders including data owners (for example energy utilities, grid operators, asset owners), application developers (for example startups, SMEs, hyperscalers) and model deployers (for example industry, grid operators, equipment manufacturers) providing a space of cooperation and collaborative data exchange.</li><li>To scale up the training and development of the models, projects can benefit from the computing capacity of the AI factories that were recently announced by the European Commission<sup>[3]</sup>, in particular the three AI factories that aim to develop AI applications for the energy sector.</li><li>AI models are expected to respect ethical, safety and security principles; furthermore, transparency, explainability, and accountability should be embedded by design in the model development. Open-source development practices should be pursued wherever feasible. Efforts should be made to avoid biases, ensuring that the data produced is representative of diverse populations.</li> </ul><p>Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative<sup>[4]</sup> and actively participate in its activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-01?order=DESC&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;keywords=CommonEuropeanEnergyDataSpace&amp;isExactMatch=true&amp;status=31094501,31094502,31094503\">Establish the grounds for a common European energy data space</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-01-11?keywords=CL5-2024-D3-01-11&amp;isExactMatch=true&amp;status=31094501,31094502,31094503&amp;order=DESC&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;sortBy=startDate\">AI Testing and Experimentation Facility (TEF) for the energy sector – bringing technology to the market</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/ai-factories_en\">AI Factories</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\">https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Renewable heating can be directly used to efficiently decarbonise industrial processes. Concentrated solar thermal technologies offer a great potential to supply renewable heat for industry for temperatures between 150°C - 400°C. Nevertheless, efforts are still required to demonstrate these technologies for a variety of industrial processes.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Showcase the capacity of concentrated solar thermal systems to largely meet the heat demand of industrial processes and to achieve a yearly solar fraction of at least 50%.</li><li>Increase competitiveness of concentrated solar thermal for industrial applications. This is to be proven by an economically feasible business case; by reducing the Levelised Cost of Heating (LCoH); and by valorising and promoting the competitive advantages of the technology such as heat storage, flexibility, and energy security.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals are expected to demonstrate concentrated solar technologies for heat production (within the 150°C - 400°C range), combined with storage, feeding the generated heat to existing heating and/or cooling processes in industry, e.g., drying, melting, sterilisation, refrigeration, etc.</p><p>The proposals are expected to efficiently integrate the solar heat system in the selected industrial application. To a possible extent, the proposals should optimise energy efficiency and heat recovery of the industrial process to maximise the coverage of the heat demand by the solar system and to ensure an efficient solar investment. Hybridisation with other on-site renewable energy technologies could be considered. However, the core solutions are expected to focus on the concentrated solar thermal part and not on the industrial process or on the hybrid renewable energy technologies.</p><p>The proposed solution is expected to be demonstrated in all possible solar incidence, and for a continuous period of at least 6 months. The replicability potential to other industrial processes should also be taken into account.</p><p>The proposals are expected to address the techno-economic feasibility and the environmental impact of the proposed systems, as well as specific issues related to the integration of the solar systems in the industrial process such as surface availability.</p><p>The proposal is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone before entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project is expected to submit: i) a proof of solid engagement of the industrial demonstration party, ii) all needed permits for deployment, iii) credible and detailed engineering plans, and iv) a complete business and implementation plan.</p><p>The use of the European Research Infrastructure for concentrated solar power EU-SOLARIS is encouraged but not mandatory.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advance in the realisation of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan Action of Renewable fuels and Bioenergy (for the fuels part) is supported, overcoming fragmentation by mobilizing resources and establishing across EU<strong> </strong>interregional value chains of renewable fuel technologies and by better alignment of public and private R&amp;I priorities and of funding mechanisms.</li><li>All sector stakeholders benefit from establishment of<strong> r</strong>enewable fuels value chains at EU, national, regional, and local level overcoming fragmentation across Europe.</li><li>Different stakeholders (e.g., EU, SET Plan countries, regions, communities, etc) benefit from their engagement in the co-creation of a very flexible R&amp;I Programme in renewable fuels.</li><li>Researchers, industry, and public authorities have access to increased knowledge and challenges of the different renewable fuel technologies along their lifecycle and value chains and benefit from synergies to overcome fragmentation of the value chains and from increased critical mass in implementing R&amp;I activities in the area.</li><li>Technology providers profit from technology development, successful demonstration and de-risking of a portfolio of renewable fuel technologies, improved access to better financing exploiting synergies across funding schemes, and from more effective market uptake, increased competitiveness and commercialization opportunities.</li><li>Energy producers, clean tech manufacturing industries and consumers benefit from improved performance and security of a portfolio of renewable fuel technologies and from better exploitation opportunities in a larger and more homogeneous marketplace.</li><li>Policy makers and regulators are provided with evidence to accelerate permitting procedures and increase the public acceptance of innovative and sustainable renewable fuel projects, minimizing negative environmental impacts including biodiversity, and improving the regulatory framework.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Following the revamp of the SET Plan and its anchoring to the NZIA and the European Research Area, it becomes urgent to boost the R&amp;I activities envisaged already under the SET Plan Implementation Plans and their further updates and contribute towards pooling diverse resources to increase the R&amp;I funding and impact across the European Research Area. This action is complementary to existing projects and instruments like the Clean Energy Technology (CET) Partnership<sup>[1]</sup> with the vision to support, facilitate and reinforce that work by providing a focused programming framework and coordinated network of active and connected stakeholders in renewable fuels.</p><p>This action aims to create connected regional renewable fuel value chain activities across Europe, involving regions with lower innovation performances, by sharing and transferring capacities and know-how. The challenge is to overcome fragmentation of the value chains where different regions have different capacities (feedstock, technology, skills) and create collaboration at EU, national, regional or local level to collectively develop and implement complete value chains of renewable fuel technologies.</p><p>The action should contribute to the implementation of the Implementation Plan<sup>[2]</sup> and its updated version(s) of the Implementation Working Group of Renewable fuels and Bioenergy under the revamped SET Plan. All renewable fuel technologies, both of biological and non-biological origin, at all TRL levels and market up-take measures, which are listed in this Implementation Plan and its updated version(s), but also new identified interregional and transnational challenges across these value chains, are within scope, including for example feedstock standardization, permitting fragmentation and lack of fit-for-purpose business models in rural regions, and using artificial intelligence as appropriate. Activities should draw from the detailed R&amp;I activities program of the Implementation Plan of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy (Annex I) regarding development, demonstration (also at pilot scale) and scale-up of</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advanced liquid and gaseous biofuels<sup>[3]</sup> through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and/or from autotrophic microorganisms and primary renewable energy.</li><li>Other renewable liquid and gaseous fuels<sup>[3]</sup> (with particular attention to direct solar and algae-based fuels but excluding hydrogen as end-product) through thermochemical/ chemical /biochemical /electrochemical transformation of energy neutral carriers (like CO2 or N2) with renewable energy.</li><li>Solid, liquid and gaseous intermediate bioenergy carriers through biochemical / thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and further upgrading to advanced biofuels</li> </ul><p>taking into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, the European Technology and Innovation Platform on Bioenergy (ETIP Bioenergy), the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) Bioenergy Joint Programme and the SET Plan Direct Solar Fuel forum as its SRIA becomes available.</p><p>The action may support networking and coordination, research and innovation, pilot actions, market uptake measures, training and mobility, awareness raising and communication, and dissemination and exploitation across an entire value chain of renewable fuel technologies, thus providing the highest possible flexibility for activities in supporting the related challenges. The action should establish a joint comprehensive plan of activities. The range of activities supported should include an appropriate set of research projects, demonstration projects, technology transfer projects and other activities.</p><p>The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed above in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.</p><p>The FSTP calls should take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal.</p><p>The FSTP calls should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.</p><p>The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs</p><p>The consortium is expected to ensure that eligibility for financial support to third parties is extended to participants established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries.</p><p>Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Inclusiveness of a broad range of EU Member States and Associated Countries is expected, aiming at involving also partners coming from Eastern Europe who could enable solutions, thus strengthening their engagement in the SET Plan. Participation of public interest legal entities such as state, and notably regional and local authorities, which may have particular interest in regional development of renewable fuel value chains, is encouraged.</p><p>Implementation of the action should profit from and capitalize the expertise in collaborating and networking of the relevant R&amp;D programmes of national governments of the ERA-NET-Bioenergy network<sup>[6]</sup> on European research cooperation and coordination related to the field of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, as well as from the EU ERA-NET BESTF3<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p>The action is expected to have a duration of 5 years. It is expected that the action will organize joint transnational calls on an annual basis and will consider ample time for the implementation of the co-funded projects, notably before its end.

As the topic envisages subsequent FSTP calls to progressively develop a given solution, the maximum amount to be granted to each party needs to be sufficiently high to cater cases where a given legal entity may receive more than one FSTP grant. </p></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>described in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-15-general-annexes_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annex G</a> of the Work Programme General Annexes.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><h4>Specific conditions</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>described in the [specific topic of the Work Programme]</p></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-ria-ia_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE RIA, IA)</a></p><p><strong>Evaluation form templates</strong> <em>— will be used with the necessary adaptations</em> </p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/ef/ef_he-ria-ia_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard evaluation form (HE RIA, IA)</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Guidance</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/programme-guide_horizon_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE Programme Guide</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a>&#xa0;</p><p><strong>Call-specific instructions</strong>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/information-on-financial-support-to-third-parties_he_en.docx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information on financial support to third parties (HE)</a>&#xa0;</p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026-2027/wp-1-general-introduction_horizon-2026-2027_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE Main Work Programme 2026-2027 – 1.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advance in the realisation of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and innovation priorities and targets for ocean energy;</li><li>Energy producers and consumers benefit from increased performance of wave and tidal energy technologies with the focus on efficiency and flexibility, reduced cost, improved reliability and sustainability, operation and maintenance, robustness and security during all stages of the lifetime of an ocean energy farm from installation, operation and maintenance to decommissioning;</li><li>Efficient and effective support to ocean energy research and innovation through alignment and cooperation among different actors, avoiding fragmentation of efforts providing effectively a significant developmental boost of wave and tidal energy technologies.</li><li>Increased contribution of ocean energy to the energy system, with minimal impacts on health and the environment (notably biodiversity) and at the lowest possible cost.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and innovation priorities<sup>[1]</sup> and targets<sup>[1]</sup> for ocean energy focussing on wave and tidal energy development. It will take into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on ocean energy (IWG ocean), the European Technology and Innovation Platform on ocean energy (ETIP Ocean)<sup>[3]</sup> and the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) joint programme on ocean energy<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>The overarching objective is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave and tidal energy systems that can survive in a harsh ocean or sea environment with minimal impacts on health and the environment and biodiversity. The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave and tidal energy development for different type of resources in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market. In this action the following can be considered:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative wave energy devices.</li><li>The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative next generation tidal energy devices</li><li>The development and demonstration of new sustainable materials in ocean energy converters, moorings and foundations whilst ensuring structural integrity, durability and circularity can be considered.</li><li>The development and demonstration of sustainable tailored mooring and connection of electrical or other power transmission systems (cable system, electrical equipment, ....) for wave and tidal energy devices. Advance combined mooring and electrical connectors or hydraulic power transmission to reduce component cost and number of connection operations, included in systems for sharing an anchor between devices in arrays. Develop novel systems for safe and quick connection/disconnection that do not require large vessels and/or diving teams.</li><li>The instrumentation for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of ocean energy devices and structures. Apply recent advances in condition and structural health monitoring from other sectors to ocean energy. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ocean energy technology development.</li><li>Advanced manufacturing of ocean energy devices and structures and auxiliary equipment considering reduced energy, manufacturing costs and materials consumption, high production throughput and optimization of logistics.</li><li>Development of technologies and solutions for the installation, maintenance and decommissioning of wave and tidal energy devices.</li> </ul><p>The validation and demonstration of new ocean energy technologies should be done in a controlled environment meaning that this is done under monitored and reproducible conditions, using for instance, test rigs and test tanks, semi-enclosed basins, or dedicated real-sea demonstration sites with instrumented monitoring infrastructure.</p><p><strong><u>Structure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation</u></strong></p><p>The action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities implemented through financial support to third parties. The latter can include cooperation with the activities undertaken by the beneficiaries of the EU grant and may complement them. The R&amp;I activities are divided into three challenges:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Breakthrough challenge</li><li>Validation challenge</li><li>Demonstration challenge</li> </ol><p>The breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities. The demonstration challenge will solely be implemented by the core consortium.</p><p>The breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the ocean energy sector and on the acceleration of ocean energy deployment at scale. The aim is that the innovative technologies have been at least validated towards the end of the project.</p><p>The validation challenge entail actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment which have been developed in the project or have been developed previously or separately in other European and national projects. FSTP can be used for new illustrative application use-cases demonstrating well defined added value to end users.</p><p>In the demonstration challenge the consortium is expected to carry out demonstration activities (up to TRL 7) in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan ocean energy R&amp;I priorities and targets and accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry. The demonstration activities will be selected using the stage gate approach developed by the IEA OES task 12<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p><em><u>Activities directly implemented by the core consortium</u></em></p><p>The activities of the core consortium are expected to include direct research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects).</p><p>It is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU funding.</p><p>The project is expected to carry out at least three demonstration activities. The focus of each demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone for each demonstration activity before entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project has to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans compliant with the applicable standards, and iv) a complete business and implementation plan. The proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these, while demonstrating how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered.</p><p>The total maximum amount of EU funding for the activities in the demonstration challenge is expected to be 24 million Euros.</p><p><em>Activities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP)</em></p><p>A share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and used to engage research organizations, academia, start-ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage.</p><p>The use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research and innovation activities, and to respond to disruptive developments, attracting different stakeholders and innovators. A tiered approach to address complex R&amp;I challenges should be adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or a by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support to successful projects initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&amp;I work can continue without major interruption.</p><p>For the FSTP calls that are related to the breakthrough challenge and the validation challenge, the following considerations should be taken into account:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of demonstrating and upscaling wave and tidal energy considering the full supply chain. Up to 3 million EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The challenge should aim at attracting new partners (academia, SMEs, scale ups) and solutions.</li><li>Validation challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge or from earlier R&amp;I projects. Up to 6 million EUR EU funding is expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.</li> </ul><p>The first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the project. The FSTP call for the validation challenge should be published in a later stage of the project enabling the use of the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core R&amp;I activities.</p><p>The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call.</p><p>For the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address broad EU geographical balance.</p><p>The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs.</p><p>Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities<sup>[6]</sup></p><p><strong><u>Governance of the project</u></strong></p><p>The action will require a strong internal governance and strong procedures. In the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges/actions for the whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). It will have to set out how and the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls.</p><p>The core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls.</p><p>The project must, for all the research and innovation activities, including the FSTP actions, embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress following the stage gate metrics developed by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring and share communicable results with the European R&amp;D community. The evaluation framework has already been introduced by the Europewave PCP action.</p><p>The project should report the progress of all its R&amp;I activities according to these mechanisms and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to plan.</p><p>The consortium will have to present a comprehensive risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go-decision.</p><p>Besides defining and tracking progress of technology-specific KPIs in the technology areas specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the ocean energy sector. <sup>[7]</sup> These annual reviews will be defined as milestones of the project and, as such, they will be subject to the approval of the granting authority.</p><p>The project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in ocean energy systems’ research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group (IWG) on Ocean Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership (CET Partnership) related initiative, and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board advised the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET plan activities. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority.</p><p>The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&amp;D community.</p><p>For activities in line with relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programme on Ocean Energy Systems (IEA TCP OES)<sup>[8]</sup>, proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research infrastructures<sup>110</sup>, especially the Marinerg-i distributed infrastructure specialising in sea applications., as well as related projects offering access research infrastructures in the ocean energy applications, such as RISEnergy (https://risenergy-project.eu)<sup>[9]</sup>.</p><p><em>Duration</em></p><p>The estimated project duration is around 5 years.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See for instance: <a href=\"https://setis.ec.europa.eu/working-groups/ocean-energy_en\">Ocean Energy - European Commission</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanset.eu/\">Homepage - Oceanset</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See for instance: <a href=\"https://setis.ec.europa.eu/working-groups/ocean-energy_en\">Ocean Energy - European Commission</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanset.eu/\">Homepage - Oceanset</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.etipocean.eu/\">ETIP | Home</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>See for instance: <a href=\"https://www.etipocean.eu/knowledge_hub/1738/\">https://www.etipocean.eu/knowledge_hub/1738/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.ocean-energy-systems.org/oes-projects/performance-metrics-international-framework-for-ocean-energy/\">OES | Performance Metrics</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] European Commission (2025), <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/other/guidance_fstp-good-practices_en.pdf\">Good practices for implementing financial support to third parties (FSTP) in EU grants</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://setis.ec.europa.eu/working-groups/ocean-energy_en\">Ocean Energy - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <a href=\"https://setis.ec.europa.eu/working-groups/ocean-energy_en\">OES | Ocean Energy Systems - an IEA Technology Collaboration Programme</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <a href=\"https://risenergy-project.eu/\">https://risenergy-project.eu</a></p>"

For example, local production and consumption, reduced transmission and distribution losses thanks to the reliance on local networks for energy needs, greater operational flexibility and reduced dependence on expensive fuel imports all contribute to a higher energy autonomy, a more secure supply, and lower, more stable overall energy costs, including for individual citizens. In addition, this alleviates a part of the load on the centralised grid and avoids blockages by the capacity of the grid.</p><p>The action should cover either urbanised or rural contexts in Africa. It should contribute to providing sustainable renewable energy access and creating other socio-economic benefits, such as improved health, economic wealth, skills and jobs, while reducing the stress on the environment, notably on biodiversity, adopting a Water Energy Food Ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus approach and following methods of the circular economy <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Actions are expected to cover the design, construct, commission and operate the demonstration installation, including aspects of energy needs and energy consumption, of grid stability and grid reinforcement in the region concerned. Actions should also develop and implement a tailored value chain approach, identifying the most suitable manufacturing value chains, on the basis of the local context, local material supply chain(s) and local workforce, with the objective of ensuring sustainable local economic development. A gender sensitive approach could further support the activities, taking into account relevant groups in a vulnerable situation such as rural communities, and women.</p><p>African SMEs are expected to play an important role in the overall value chain and to contribute in the identifying the needs. Participation of EU private sector actors should also be encouraged in alignment with the priorities of Global Gateway Strategy. Actions should also include the identification of technical, vocational and educational needs of the workforce and propose relevant training and qualification activities. Actions should finally define a market and business strategy that could take into consideration funding from European and international financial instruments and development finance programmes to ensure impact through a quick and viable commercial take-up of the technological solution demonstrated.</p><p>Social innovation should be considered. The business plan is expected to include appropriate consideration of available financial support instruments (local, regional and/or international) to enhance the speedy market deployment of the solution. The aspects of regulatory environment and local communities’ governance needs and/or impacts are also to be considered.</p><p>Proposals are expected to include a life cycle analysis showing the impact of the proposed solutions when compared to other technologies/solutions on the environment, on climate change targets and on the social and the economic dimensions, taking a cradle to grave viewpoint, encompassing the design and the operation phases. The life cycle analysis should take a cradle to grave approach. Proposals should adopt a circular economy approach. Whenever negative impacts have been identified, mitigations measures are expected.</p><p>As the demonstration installation will be located in Africa, relevant African partners have to participate in the implementation of the project. A balanced involvement in the activities of the projects of European and African partners will be considered an asset in the evaluation. Actions should also participate in and contribute to the African Union<sup>[2]</sup> - European Union collaborative research action on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy, in particular through cooperation/collaboration with the project LEAP-SE (<a href=\"http://www.leap-re.eu\">www.leap-re.eu</a>). Alignment with Global Gateway ongoing activities on renewable energy in Africa should be also prioritized, including the collaboration with EU Delegation and EU private sector actors in Africa, as well as with the Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA) and Cluster 6’s topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-02-two-stage.</p><p>Lesson learned from the implementation of European Renewable Energy Valleys projects should be considered. These projects are REFORMERS<sup>[3]</sup> and CRETE VALLEY<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Proven access to necessary land and / or permits for operation at the time of application and / or convincing risk management regarding delayed availability of land or permits are expected in the proposal.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] For an example of a methodology for the assessment of sustainability, circularity and contribution the EU resilience and technological autonomy of clean energy technology in the R&amp;I pipeline, please see <a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-publications/study-circular-approaches-sustainable-and-affordable-clean-energy-transition_en\">Study on circular approaches for a sustainable and affordable clean energy transition</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>“African Union member states” includes countries whose membership has been temporarily suspended.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136211</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136139</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The REPowerEU plan and the EU Solar Energy Strategy introduced targets for the deployment of solar PV amounting to 600 GWac by 2030. Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel technologies offer therefore the opportunity to innovative start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Increase the potential for commercialisation of innovative PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;</li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;</li><li>Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Solar cells/modules with conversion efficiencies beyond those commercially available and degradation/reliability and performance at least on par with the most reliable commercially available technologies;</li><li>A multi-MWp-ready resilient, energy efficient, defect-free production technology for cells/modules;</li><li>Production equipment &amp; pilot line, including digitalised and automated processing. </li> </ul><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

Provided solutions must be socioeconomically and environmentally sustainable (including biodiversity) and provide a respective assessment. Issues which can be addressed are for example: Innovative design of turbines (and also draft tubes, nozzles and distributors) and generators, including innovative improvements based on future load cycles and extending their intended life time; new models and simulation tools for harsher operational conditions; digitalisation and artificial intelligence to advance instrumentation and controls and flexibility and to develop innovative operational strategies towards reduced O&amp;M costs; transient aspect linked to new operating patterns of hydro plants to cope with climate changes and renewable base load; new materials for increased efficiency and resistance of equipment and increased performance, life time and resilience of infrastructure including e.g. phasing out of PFAS and mineral oils; low-GHG balance concrete; automated maintenance of metal hydropower turbines to reduce cost; operator hazards and reduce LCoE related to OPEX; Improving water uses resilience via integrated operations and management; simulation and forecasting tools for integrated risk and mitigation analysis for climate change adaptation and in response to extreme weather events by taking fully into account biodiversity requirements by targeting good ecological status and e.g. fish migration; water flows and sediment dynamics not hampering flexible hydropower production, innovative techniques for enhancing the life time of concrete structures and the overtopping safety of embankment and rockfill structures.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The REPowerEU plan and the EU Solar Energy Strategy introduced targets for the deployment of solar PV amounting to 600 GWac by 2030. Complying with these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. Novel tandem technologies offer therefore the opportunity for innovative spin-offs or start-ups and scale-ups to manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the resilience of the EU PV value chain and thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing security.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Increase the potential for commercialisation of tandem PV technologies creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;</li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance;</li><li>Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. </li> </ol><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate tandem technologies with similar lifetimes to Si and higher efficiencies (beyond the Si limits);</li><li>Demonstrate interface and thin-film large scale engineering;</li><li>Demonstrate production processes and equipment ready for large scale deployment. </li> </ul><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Large PV systems such as utility scale PV are evolving towards higher voltage architecture (&gt;=3kV) with the objective to minimize losses and improve system efficiency at lower costs. The intention is to integrate also storage into such (hybrid) PV systems offering flexibility. It is consequently essential to build a blueprint for the implementation of high voltage large PV systems and the development of Direct Current (DC) networks around strategic end users for high voltage demand (industrial sites, servers, electric vehicle charging stations…). Understanding the factors that influence the performance and economics of these system architectures will help system planners evaluate the potential benefits of such hybrid resources that could support an increasing future industrial electrification. Another crucial challenge to address in ensuring the continued growth of new investments in solar PV, is the increasing occurrence of zero or negative prices in the electricity market, which dramatically hurt the profitability of operating solar PV assets. To tackle this challenge, PV participation to ancillary services is a way forward, which would reduce significantly system operating costs and PV curtailment and improve system reliability and PV profitability. The coupling/pooling with other generation assets or storage/demand assets is also to be considered.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes as indicated for the proposed scope (high voltage DC PV systems or PV participation in electricity markets):</p><p>Scope 1: High-voltage DC PV systems: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Highly efficient PV systems, optimal utilisation of generated PV electricity, energy savings;</li><li>Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and affordable electricity for industrial users. </li> </ol><p>Scope 2: PV participation in electricity markets: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Increased social profitability of PV by participation to ancillary services;</li><li>Energy efficient, cost competitive and flexible contribution of PV systems to the energy markets. </li> </ol><p>All proposals are expected to support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda. </p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals are expected to cover at least one of the following scopes:</p><p>Scope 1: High-voltage DC PV systems:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Design higher voltage system architectures and evaluate the efficiency benefit;</li><li>Develop the blueprint for an AC (Alternating Current)/DC hybrid solution for managing end user loads, achieving high levels of efficiency;</li><li>Demonstrate a high voltage &gt;3kV operating in DC grids for industrial installations hybrid system;</li><li>Investigate the impact of higher voltage on PV modules. </li> </ul><p>Scope 2: PV participation in electricity markets:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate integrated management of PV generators for dynamic and/or nodal pricing;</li><li>Pool PV with other consumption/production assets to participate in balancing mechanisms; assess the viability of these systems and demonstrate business models and financing schemes;</li><li>Demonstrate reliability, procurement driven risk mitigation and better system availability through digitalization. </li> </ul><p>Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation as well as a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced reliability, resilience, and efficiency of electricity transmission grids. Grid congestion is managed efficiently;</li><li>Enhanced observability of grids and improved forecasting of supply, demand, grid capacity availability, and flexibility;</li><li>Transmission system operators (TSO) leverage modern digital solutions and employ improved systems to effectively manage their grids and improve interoperability with other TSOs;</li><li>Vendor-agnostic reference architectures, solutions and tools are developed to help advancing the TSO control room design and operation. </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Projects are expected to address all the following items:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Design and test innovative solutions, technologies and processes for advancing the way the TSO control rooms are designed and operated, increasing observability and entailing enhanced support for the operators, providing more automation and enhanced support for decision, faster response times and less room for error. The solutions are expected to incorporate both hardware and software aspects;</li><li>Analyse and include, as far as possible, solutions for Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) to extend the real-time monitoring and control capabilities over large areas, while coping with the decentralisation and increased complexity of the system;</li><li>The novel solutions are expected to help the operators to manage better grid congestion and incorporate more renewables while reducing curtailment. The solutions will facilitate data-driven grid operations, capitalising on real-time analytics and data from smart assets. The solutions may include preparation, recovery and/or restoration from incidents (including extreme weather events);</li><li>Help the grid operators to update their operational tools in light of the deep transformation of the grids, notably the distributed nature of generation. May include the option to de-centralise the control for increasing the resilience of decision-making;</li><li>Advance forecasting solutions for energy supply, demand and flexibility made available to the system operator, need for ancillary services, as well as for grid hosting capacity; provide advanced analytics and visualisations;</li><li>Develop interoperability between the control rooms of different TSOs (and using different vendor solutions) to secure seamless data exchanges and coordination. Develop interoperability between the TSO control rooms and other entities connected to the transmission grids, including the adjacent DSOs.</li><li>Leverage modern solutions, notably digital twins and artificial intelligence. Use security-by-design and advanced protection mechanisms against cyber threats. Use and/or develop, to the greatest extent possible, open-source software solutions and or software modules;</li><li>Develop a manual and propose best practices on this matter to be used by other TSOs (including operation instructions). Identify remaining gaps and further needs for research and development. </li> </ul><p>The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two pilots in different EU Member States or Associated Countries.</p><p>Projects are expected to include at least two electricity Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and at least two universities and/or research organisations.</p><p>Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities and projects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>at least one supplier of technology and solutions for TSO control rooms;</li><li>at least two distribution system operators, which manage grids that are connected to the grids operated by any of the TSOs that are partners in the project;</li><li>(at least) one project funded under the separate call ‘Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADSM) for more efficient and flexible distribution grids’ with the view to strengthen TSO-DSO coordination and support interoperable solutions. To that end, the project proposals are expected to describe a credible mechanism to do so. </li> </ul><p>This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not necessarily apply per each pilot in particular.</p><p>Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative<sup>[1]</sup> and actively participate in its activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/\">https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/</a></p>"

To maximise the impact, projects should have a substantial industrial involvement.</p><p>Projects should address most, but not necessarily all of the below issues:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Detailed planning and preparation for retrofitting capture systems to existing industrial plants;</li><li>Demonstrating important system components;</li><li>Identification and characterisation of the clustering potential of (cross-border) regional CO2 emitters;</li><li>Optimisation of industrial symbiosis between emitters and potential users of CO2;</li><li>Development of tools to optimise the design and operation of the cluster(s) and operate CO2 streams with different compositions, flow rates and operating regimes to comply with the constraints for the shared transport and storage infrastructure;</li><li>Identification of potential regional users of a common CO<sub>2</sub> infrastructure (this could also include enlargement counties, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova);</li><li>Comprehensive economic and technical assessment to identify the best (multimodal) transport options, including the re-use of existing infrastructure;</li><li>Development of business models for regional CO2 transport networks, including for dispersed industrial sites to link these to larger industrial clusters or pipeline networks;</li><li>Consideration of feasible CO2 geological storage services</li><li>Comprehensive set of studies and preparatory actions leading to permitting;</li><li>Scenarios for integrating CO2 infrastructure in (plans for) regional, national and/or cross-border energy networks (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas), also in relation to future changes in industrial landscape and energy supply mix. </li> </ul><p>Projects are expected to deliver a strategy for the exploitation of results that includes plans for scalability, commercialisation, deployment, permitting procedures, and identified public and private funding sources for CAPEX and OPEX, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the Regional Development policy funds.</p><p>For CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and (in particular onshore) geological storage, public acceptability is paramount. Therefore, projects are expected to identify and engage relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) in deliberative activities, so as to consider and respond to their needs and concerns.</p><p><u>This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026-2027 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of R&amp;I activities to societal needs and concerns.</li><li>This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities. </li> </ul>"
