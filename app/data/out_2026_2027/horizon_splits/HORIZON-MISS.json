            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality in cities. To this end, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Cities involved in this action advance in achieving their climate neutrality targets, reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions by <strong>improving energy efficiency</strong> in <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, complemented by <strong>urban mobility service car fleets – taxis, ride-hailing, car sharing</strong><strong> </strong>and other<strong> active and shared mobility services</strong>.</li><li>Comprehensive <strong>inventory and assessment</strong> of existing instruments and measures to foster <strong>electrification</strong> and attractiveness of <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, <strong>urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility,</strong> accompanied by targeted <strong>guidance</strong> for responsible authorities, operators and providers through integration of measures to improve energy efficiency in public transport and new shared mobility services.</li><li><strong>Upscaling of innovative and sustainable integrated mobility solutions</strong>, identifying gaps and shortcomings in existing systems and exchanging of best practices in the pilot sites involved in the action leading to a state-of-the-art of electrification and attractiveness of urban and suburban public transport with complementary <strong>urban mobility service car fleets</strong><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>other<strong> active and shared mobility solutions</strong>.</li><li>Enhanced <strong>assessment</strong> <strong>tools</strong> to quantify the direct benefits and associated co-benefits of decarbonised urban mobility service car fleets and of<strong> </strong>new shared mobility solutions complementary to public transport (including evaluation of impacts on modal shift, increased intermodal mobility and diverse user needs), the trade-off analysis between different solution and the recommendation of the most suitable implementation strategies, thereby helping to attract public investments.</li> </ul><p>Further <strong>progress towards achieving the targets set by relevant EU strategies and policies </strong>such as the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0400&amp;qid=1623311742827\">Zero Pollution Action Plan</a><sup>[1]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020DC0789\">Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy</a><sup>[2]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52021DC0811\">new EU Urban Mobility Framework</a><sup>[3]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1498648c-63fc-4715-975d-ccbc64703da5_en?filename=Communication%20-%20Decarbonising%20corporate%20fleets.pdf\">Decarbonise Corporate Fleets Communication</a><sup>[4]</sup> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AJOL_2023_231_R_0001&amp;qid=1695186598766\">Energy Efficiency Directive</a><sup>[5]</sup>.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Public transport is firmly at the centre of sustainable urban mobility policies at EU level and across Member States, in complementarity with active mobility and shared mobility services. However more needs to be done to make sure that<strong> urban and suburban public passenger transport, </strong>including<strong> coaches, </strong>and<strong> urban mobility service car fleets </strong>are<strong> </strong><strong>energy efficient </strong>and<strong> attractive</strong>, contributing to climate neutrality targets as well as to cleaner and healthier urban and sub-urban environments.</p><p>In addition, an optimal integration of public transport with other/new shared mobility services can increase its uptake by offering services that are complementary, offering coherent solutions allowing interconnection between mass transit and “last-mile” solutions. <strong>Designing urban and sub-urban systems</strong> that are <strong>energy-efficient and attractive and are tailored</strong> for complementary mobility options requires different thinking: e.g. new approaches to integrated urban planning; changes to or upgrades of infrastructure and redistribution of public space; better use of data and technology solutions to enable effective multimodality, including leveraging AI solutions; targeted local policies to promote and integrate different mobility options, to increase connectivity especially in peri-urban, rural, and underserved areas throughout the city, extending beyond the city centre.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to explore and test solutions to <strong>increase energy-efficiency and attractiveness of urban and sub-urban public transport, urban mobility service car fleets, </strong>and <strong>other active and shared mobility solutions,</strong> in the pilot sites involved in the proposals, including by facilitating <strong>exchange of experiences and good practices and fostering learning at European level</strong>. The work should lead to an updated and comprehensive overview of the <strong>state of the art of the electrification </strong>of <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, and <strong>urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility solutions, </strong>including an assessment of gaps and shortcomings in existing systems.</p><p>The topic invites proposals from consortia including at least three cities from different Member States or Associated Countries along with at least three follower cities, ensuring a good geographical balance. Follower cities can be from the same Member State or Associated Country as the lead cities. At least one of the three lead cities must be one of the 112 cities selected for the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities. The consortium should bring together academia, responsible local authorities, public transport operators, urban mobility service car fleet providers, shared mobility service providers, and other relevant stakeholders. The goal is to collaboratively test and <strong>implement a mix </strong>of technological and non-technological innovations, along with policy-based measures, to <strong>enhance the energy efficiency and appeal</strong> of urban and suburban public transport in complementarity with urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility solutions. An assessment of the overall ecological footprint, including impacts on air quality, of the tested solutions should also be carried out, taking into account the whole value chain and possible rebound effects.</p><p>From the lessons learnt through the testing of solutions, <strong>recommendations and guidance on optimal integration of energy efficient urban and suburban public transport</strong> with <strong>urban mobility service car fleets,</strong> active and<strong> </strong>shared mobility solutions should be <strong>provided for local authorities and public transport operators</strong>. Recommendations and measures could cover e.g. newly-emerging technologies and soft measures such as marketing, real time information and awareness raising campaigns and co-creation of user-oriented and environmentally sustainable solutions– with particular regard to the specific needs of diverse user groups. Proposals could test the establishment of new operating and business models. Proposals may also include take-up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making. To facilitate replication, upscaling and up-taking of the generated outcomes and to foster capacity building/upskilling of public authorities, local actors and communities, actions should engage in outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[6]</sup>. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform and the CIVITAS initiative are included in the work-plan<sup>[7]</sup>.<em> </em> Proposals should plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM(2021) 400 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] COM(2020) 789 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] COM(2021)811</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] COM(2025) 96 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] DIRECTIVE (EU) 2023/1791 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 September 2023 on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <a href=\"https://civitas.eu/\">https://civitas.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] The CIVITAS initiative should establish, through a collaboration agreement set up together with the Cities Mission Platform, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.</p>"

To this end, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Cities involved in this action advance in achieving their climate neutrality targets, reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions by <strong>improving energy efficiency</strong> in <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, complemented by <strong>urban mobility service car fleets – taxis, ride-hailing, car sharing</strong><strong> </strong>and other<strong> active and shared mobility services</strong>.</li><li>Comprehensive <strong>inventory and assessment</strong> of existing instruments and measures to foster <strong>electrification</strong> and attractiveness of <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, <strong>urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility,</strong> accompanied by targeted <strong>guidance</strong> for responsible authorities, operators and providers through integration of measures to improve energy efficiency in public transport and new shared mobility services.</li><li><strong>Upscaling of innovative and sustainable integrated mobility solutions</strong>, identifying gaps and shortcomings in existing systems and exchanging of best practices in the pilot sites involved in the action leading to a state-of-the-art of electrification and attractiveness of urban and suburban public transport with complementary <strong>urban mobility service car fleets</strong><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>other<strong> active and shared mobility solutions</strong>.</li><li>Enhanced <strong>assessment</strong> <strong>tools</strong> to quantify the direct benefits and associated co-benefits of decarbonised urban mobility service car fleets and of<strong> </strong>new shared mobility solutions complementary to public transport (including evaluation of impacts on modal shift, increased intermodal mobility and diverse user needs), the trade-off analysis between different solution and the recommendation of the most suitable implementation strategies, thereby helping to attract public investments.</li> </ul><p>Further <strong>progress towards achieving the targets set by relevant EU strategies and policies </strong>such as the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0400&amp;qid=1623311742827\">Zero Pollution Action Plan</a><sup>[1]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020DC0789\">Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy</a><sup>[2]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52021DC0811\">new EU Urban Mobility Framework</a><sup>[3]</sup>, the <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1498648c-63fc-4715-975d-ccbc64703da5_en?filename=Communication%20-%20Decarbonising%20corporate%20fleets.pdf\">Decarbonise Corporate Fleets Communication</a><sup>[4]</sup> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AJOL_2023_231_R_0001&amp;qid=1695186598766\">Energy Efficiency Directive</a><sup>[5]</sup>.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Public transport is firmly at the centre of sustainable urban mobility policies at EU level and across Member States, in complementarity with active mobility and shared mobility services. However more needs to be done to make sure that<strong> urban and suburban public passenger transport, </strong>including<strong> coaches, </strong>and<strong> urban mobility service car fleets </strong>are<strong> </strong><strong>energy efficient </strong>and<strong> attractive</strong>, contributing to climate neutrality targets as well as to cleaner and healthier urban and sub-urban environments.</p><p>In addition, an optimal integration of public transport with other/new shared mobility services can increase its uptake by offering services that are complementary, offering coherent solutions allowing interconnection between mass transit and “last-mile” solutions. <strong>Designing urban and sub-urban systems</strong> that are <strong>energy-efficient and attractive and are tailored</strong> for complementary mobility options requires different thinking: e.g. new approaches to integrated urban planning; changes to or upgrades of infrastructure and redistribution of public space; better use of data and technology solutions to enable effective multimodality, including leveraging AI solutions; targeted local policies to promote and integrate different mobility options, to increase connectivity especially in peri-urban, rural, and underserved areas throughout the city, extending beyond the city centre.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to explore and test solutions to <strong>increase energy-efficiency and attractiveness of urban and sub-urban public transport, urban mobility service car fleets, </strong>and <strong>other active and shared mobility solutions,</strong> in the pilot sites involved in the proposals, including by facilitating <strong>exchange of experiences and good practices and fostering learning at European level</strong>. The work should lead to an updated and comprehensive overview of the <strong>state of the art of the electrification </strong>of <strong>urban and sub-urban public transport systems</strong>, and <strong>urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility solutions, </strong>including an assessment of gaps and shortcomings in existing systems.</p><p>The topic invites proposals from consortia including at least three cities from different Member States or Associated Countries along with at least three follower cities, ensuring a good geographical balance. Follower cities can be from the same Member State or Associated Country as the lead cities. At least one of the three lead cities must be one of the 112 cities selected for the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities. The consortium should bring together academia, responsible local authorities, public transport operators, urban mobility service car fleet providers, shared mobility service providers, and other relevant stakeholders. The goal is to collaboratively test and <strong>implement a mix </strong>of technological and non-technological innovations, along with policy-based measures, to <strong>enhance the energy efficiency and appeal</strong> of urban and suburban public transport in complementarity with urban mobility service car fleets and shared mobility solutions. An assessment of the overall ecological footprint, including impacts on air quality, of the tested solutions should also be carried out, taking into account the whole value chain and possible rebound effects.</p><p>From the lessons learnt through the testing of solutions, <strong>recommendations and guidance on optimal integration of energy efficient urban and suburban public transport</strong> with <strong>urban mobility service car fleets,</strong> active and<strong> </strong>shared mobility solutions should be <strong>provided for local authorities and public transport operators</strong>. Recommendations and measures could cover e.g. newly-emerging technologies and soft measures such as marketing, real time information and awareness raising campaigns and co-creation of user-oriented and environmentally sustainable solutions– with particular regard to the specific needs of diverse user groups. Proposals could test the establishment of new operating and business models. Proposals may also include take-up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making. To facilitate replication, upscaling and up-taking of the generated outcomes and to foster capacity building/upskilling of public authorities, local actors and communities, actions should engage in outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[6]</sup>. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform and the CIVITAS initiative are included in the work-plan<sup>[7]</sup>.<em> </em> Proposals should plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] COM(2021) 400 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] COM(2020) 789 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] COM(2021)811</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] COM(2025) 96 final</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] DIRECTIVE (EU) 2023/1791 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 September 2023 on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <a href=\"https://civitas.eu/\">https://civitas.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] The CIVITAS initiative should establish, through a collaboration agreement set up together with the Cities Mission Platform, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The projects are expected to deliver on one of or combination of the following topic outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Faster transition of district heating systems towards low-temperature operations</li><li>Faster transition of building heating systems towards low-temperature operations</li><li>Increased use of renewable energy and/or waste heat.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Low-temperature district heating systems in urban areas offer higher potential for integration of renewable energy sources and waste heat, but their deployment is slowed down because the existing stock of inefficient buildings has been designed for high-temperature heat delivery systems. The topic supports the creation of the conditions necessary for the conversion of existing supply solutions – district heating, as well as individual heating ones – into low-temperature alternatives, along with reducing and optimising the heat load of buildings.</p><p>Efficient district heating systems are expected to meet increasingly stringent criteria in terms of the use of renewable energy, waste heat and/or co-generation in line with Article 26(1) of the Directive (EU) 2023/1791. To help district heating operators meet those criteria, there is a need to demonstrate solutions that support the <strong>transition to low-temperature district heating systems</strong> operating at supply temperatures at below 70°C.</p><p>There is currently a limited choice of established non-fossil fuel heating and hot water systems to replace fossil-fuel based heating systems in multi-apartment buildings. There is a need to demonstrate systems based on <strong>heat pumps solutions</strong> to replace both central and individual fossil fuel boilers in existing residential multi-apartment buildings.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address at least <strong>two </strong>of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Demonstrate system design and technical solutions at district and building level, to enable the integration of various heat supply sources (particularly renewable energy sources and waste heat), and to facilitate the transition to low-temperature district heating systems. Furthermore, refine digital tools for the control and monitoring of district heating systems as well as digital tools to support decision-making both at the initial planning stages and for the standardized replication of solutions.</li><li>Demonstrate building-level heating solutions for hot water and low-temperature heating with maximum heating supply temperatures up to 50°C and fulfilling water safety regulations in at least four residential multi-apartment buildings of at least 1000 m2 each. The solutions should be transferrable and standardised.</li><li>Demonstrate building-level heating solutions for hot water and heating needs in at least four residential multi-apartment buildings of at least 1000 m2 each that use either on-site renewable energy sources or an ambient or geothermal loop shared with other buildings / facilities, or a connection to district heating systems for the heat supply.</li><li>At a building, district or city level, demonstrate approaches for connecting buildings via district heating networks and ambient or geothermal loops to reduce the overall energy demand, to facilitate the deployment of low-temperature district heating systems and to improve heating systems’ flexibility via the integration of heat storage, including in heat networks, by or with the inclusion of energy communities.</li><li>Ensure the participation of local energy communities to assess their socio-economic benefits for the local community and heating system operators.</li> </ul><p>Projects are expected to demonstrate the proposed solutions in two different climate zones, at building, district and/or city level, and to assess the environmental, social and economic benefits of the proposed solutions for the local community and heating system operators while accounting for the regional economic and regulatory aspects. The system design must include advanced controls to allow exploiting the energy flexibility of individual heating systems in a collective way. Projects must present a concise state-of-the-art of existing relevant solutions, knowledge and tools from EU funded projects.</p><p>Projects are expected to contribute to the implementation of Climate City Contracts and/or Sustainable Energy Action Plans, Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential. The collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date. Under the guidance of the Cities Mission Platform, the selected projects will engage in clustering activities with other relevant projects supported under the Cities Mission to promote synergies and complementarities. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform are included in the work-plan.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Projects are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved awareness of the potential of Low Voltage Direct Current (LVDC) microgrids to support the goals of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal, including as defined under the SET Plan<sup>[1]</sup> and the Solar Strategy<sup>[2]</sup>.</li><li>Increased acceptance of LVDC microgrids in Europe, with significant and measurable contributions to human and building safety (notably with respect to DC faults), energy and resource efficiency, integration of renewables &amp; storage and demand response, peak power shaving, resilience, and (where applicable) established proof of concept on how LVDC microgrids can enable energy communities<sup>[3]</sup> to share energy assets and increase self-consumption of local renewables sources.</li><li>Increased uptake in European cities, facilitated by technical guidelines for installation of LVDC microgrids and recommendations on regulatory alignment to European, national, regional and local authorities, as well as power distribution operators.</li><li>Increased number of regulatory options and standards supporting EU industry leadership in the supply of LVDC solutions, in line with the Competitiveness Compass guidelines for fostering innovation and growth.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Most electric appliances in buildings are based on Direct Current (DC): PV panels, stationary and e-vehicle batteries, LED lighting, IT equipment, heat pumps and other appliances. Their connection to a LVDC microgrid inside the building would significantly improve energy and materials efficiency (replacing AC/DC converters by simpler DC/DC converters) and optimise local electrical and/or thermal energy storage and self-consumption of local renewables, contribute to (AC) grids stability through demand response and ancillary services (incl. reactive power support), and increase resilience by enabling islanded operation. The required power capacity of the connection of the LVDC microgrid to the AC (Alternating Current) distribution grid via a central AC/DC converter would be significantly lower than a traditional AC installation, thereby reducing pressure on city grid.</p><p>The LVDC microgrid could also be implemented at small neighbourhood level (e.g. a street), possibly in parallel to an existing AC grid, enabling more efficient and easier sharing of common energy assets and self-consumption in an energy community.</p><p>In order to reach this goal, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop innovative, safe and sustainable LVDC microgrids design methods and tools, ensuring notably grid monitoring, control and safe handling of DC faults at affordable cost; develop methodologies and assess the life-cycle costs/benefits of LVDC microgrids (compared to traditional AC installations), for the application itself and the overall energy system (including the impacts on the AC distribution grid, for example, due to the injection of harmonics, or contribution to grid stability through ancillary services and demand response over the current and next day), from technical, environmental, economic and social aspects (notably on vulnerable consumers energy bill).</li><li>Demonstrate in real life an LVDC microgrid, connecting all electrical applications in at least one residential, office or commercial building, or in one neighbourhood. The proposal must already include a review of the local regulatory framework(s) and grid codes and a demonstration that the real-life implementation(s) of the LVDC microgrid will be possible in the local context(s) (possibly through pre-agreed regulatory relaxation or ‘innovation sandbox’).</li><li>Beyond the real demonstration(s), the installation of LVDC microgrid must be demonstrated virtually in other types of buildings, including at least one building under renovation, in the environment of different cities and countries, including at least one vulnerable urban area if possible, by numerical simulation using digital twins<sup>[4]</sup>, with the objective of assessing the regulatory feasibility and life-cycle costs/benefits (detailed in the first bullet) in these different environments. The total number of real and virtual demonstrations must be at least 3.</li><li>Identify regulatory barriers at European, national and distribution system operator levels, and make suggestions to resolve them.</li><li>Contribute to standardization (CEN-CENELEC, IEC), notably contributing use cases.</li><li>Develop LVDC solutions awareness, education and training materials (respectively for public authorities and general public, for students, for urban planners, project developers and installers), in collaboration with local academia and research partners.</li><li>Disseminate project results, engage all relevant stakeholders along the value chain, including residents, users, industry, and researchers, from the planning phase; organise at least one open workshop coupled with site visits.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires contributions from social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions. Their contributions should enhance the societal relevance and impact of proposed activities from planning to implementation and especially related to the last two bullets.</p><p>The projects under this topic shall be open to cooperate with each other on relevant tasks such as joint workshops and dissemination events and joint policy briefs and contribution to standardisation process, to maximise the collective impact.</p><p>Proposals should build on previous projects, notably Horizon Europe project <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136131\">Shift2DC</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/957788\">HYPERRIDE</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/957769\">TIGON</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101172757\">HYNET</a> and <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101172877\">THEUS</a>. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential. The collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date. Under the guidance of the Cities Mission Platform, the selected projects will engage in clustering activities with other relevant projects supported under the Cities Mission, such as the ones on PED digital twins, to promote synergies and complementarities. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform are included in the work-plan.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://setis.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d312944b-df45-4ebb-b2bd-d8616d13bbf4_en?filename=SET-Plan-LVDC-Implementation-Plan-12sep2024-endorsed.pdf\">SET Plan LVDC Implementation Plan (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] COM(2022) 221 final, p14, The European Commission communication on the EU Solar Energy Strategy recognises that increasing the use of DC technologies could be beneficial to the electricity system: as renewable power from solar is produced in Direct Current (DC), conversion to Alternating Current (AC) to feed into the grid and then converting back to DC, e.g. to store energy, leads to energy losses; such conversion losses are currently growing because more devices and system, such as batteries, heat-pumps, data centres, electric vehicles or appliances, operate in DC.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Energy communities – defined under the Renewable Energy Directive and the Electricity Market Directive, and further supported by the upcoming Citizens Energy Package are identified as a vehicle to empower citizens, small businesses and local authorities to produce, manage and consumer their own energy.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-miss-2023-cit-01-02\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-miss-2023-cit-01-02</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>A growing number of cities across Europe is developing hydrogen strategies, either for mobility applications or for decarbonising their local and peri-urban industries and hard-to-abate sectors. By acting as experimentation and innovation hubs, these cities can be testbeds for the energy transition, balancing decarbonisation with competitiveness and social cohesion.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Investments in - and deployment of - hydrogen applications and infrastructure for hard-to-abate sectors in and around cities to mitigate local air pollution and lead to economic growth and jobs, bringing urban environments at the forefront of sustainability and innovation.</li><li>Communities of practice to foster the interaction between stakeholders from cities, ports, industry, local and regional government, as well as researchers and citizens.</li><li>Enhanced synergies between the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Horizon Europe Clean Hydrogen Partnership.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The selected project is expected to establish ‘twinning’ of Hydrogen Valleys (in particular those that have elements relevant for cities or ports) with cities that are interested to decarbonise their local and peri-urban hard-to-abate sectors using hydrogen and to improve air quality. Focus should be on hard-to-abate and/or hard-to-electrify sectors, such as industrial uses, heavy-duty and long-distance transport, aviation, maritime uses, or any combination thereof. The use of hydrogen for heating purposes is out of scope.</p><p>Twinning will help cities to access the best available expertise and tools that can enable them to identify and implement decarbonisation strategies based on renewable hydrogen. To foster cooperation between cities and Member States, it is encouraged that there is a geographical balance between the participating authorities to foster learning from different projects and approaches.</p><p>This twinning should be based on mentor-mentee pairings; these could also target enlargement countries, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine, and Moldova.</p><p>The project is expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Organise a selection procedure (for example in the form of public calls for expression of interest) to identify the most promising twinning pairs that will be selected to develop collaborative activities;</li><li>Develop and implement for each twinning pair a tailor-made set of collaborative activities;</li><li>Deliver for each twinned city a detailed roadmap outlining the future steps to integrate renewable hydrogen in their industrial decarbonisation;</li><li>Facilitate the interaction between participating cities to address shared challenges and solutions;</li> </ul><p>Collaborative activities can address for example:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Feasibility assessments (including technology choices, sources of renewable hydrogen, business cases, regulatory issues and stakeholder engagement);</li><li>Designing a detailed implementation plan (including funding strategy, permitting, infrastructure requirements, supply chain integration);</li><li>Environmental and socio-economic impact assessment;</li><li>Sharing best practices and lessons learned;</li><li>Education and training.</li> </ul><p>At least one of the cities selected for twinning is expected to be one of the 112 cities selected for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities<sup>[1]</sup>. The project is expected to enhance the synergies between the Horizon Europe Clean Hydrogen Partnership and the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by making optimal use of the information available through the Hydrogen Valley Platform<sup>[2]</sup> and the Cities Mission Platform<sup>[3]</sup>. Under the guidance of the Cities Mission Platform, the selected project will engage in clustering activities with other relevant projects supported under the Cities Mission to promote synergies and complementarities. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing these synergies as well as clustering activities are included in the work-plan.</p><p>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 Communication on EU Missions assessment<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] The EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities aims to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 and ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. On 28 April 2022, the Commission announced the 100 EU cities that will participate in the Mission. In addition, 12 cities have been selected from countries associated or expected to be associated the Horizon Europe programme.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://h2v.eu/\">Mission Innovation Hydrogen Valley Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://netzerocities.eu/\">NetZeroCities</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>COM(2023) 457 final and SWD(2023) 260 final</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>A growing number of cities across Europe is developing hydrogen strategies, either for mobility applications or for decarbonising their local and peri-urban industries and hard-to-abate sectors. By acting as experimentation and innovation hubs, these cities can be testbeds for the energy transition, balancing decarbonisation with competitiveness and social cohesion.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Investments in - and deployment of - hydrogen applications and infrastructure for hard-to-abate sectors in and around cities to mitigate local air pollution and lead to economic growth and jobs, bringing urban environments at the forefront of sustainability and innovation.</li><li>Communities of practice to foster the interaction between stakeholders from cities, ports, industry, local and regional government, as well as researchers and citizens.</li><li>Enhanced synergies between the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Horizon Europe Clean Hydrogen Partnership.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The selected project is expected to establish ‘twinning’ of Hydrogen Valleys (in particular those that have elements relevant for cities or ports) with cities that are interested to decarbonise their local and peri-urban hard-to-abate sectors using hydrogen and to improve air quality. Focus should be on hard-to-abate and/or hard-to-electrify sectors, such as industrial uses, heavy-duty and long-distance transport, aviation, maritime uses, or any combination thereof. The use of hydrogen for heating purposes is out of scope.</p><p>Twinning will help cities to access the best available expertise and tools that can enable them to identify and implement decarbonisation strategies based on renewable hydrogen. To foster cooperation between cities and Member States, it is encouraged that there is a geographical balance between the participating authorities to foster learning from different projects and approaches.</p><p>This twinning should be based on mentor-mentee pairings; these could also target enlargement countries, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine, and Moldova.</p><p>The project is expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Organise a selection procedure (for example in the form of public calls for expression of interest) to identify the most promising twinning pairs that will be selected to develop collaborative activities;</li><li>Develop and implement for each twinning pair a tailor-made set of collaborative activities;</li><li>Deliver for each twinned city a detailed roadmap outlining the future steps to integrate renewable hydrogen in their industrial decarbonisation;</li><li>Facilitate the interaction between participating cities to address shared challenges and solutions;</li> </ul><p>Collaborative activities can address for example:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Feasibility assessments (including technology choices, sources of renewable hydrogen, business cases, regulatory issues and stakeholder engagement);</li><li>Designing a detailed implementation plan (including funding strategy, permitting, infrastructure requirements, supply chain integration);</li><li>Environmental and socio-economic impact assessment;</li><li>Sharing best practices and lessons learned;</li><li>Education and training.</li> </ul><p>At least one of the cities selected for twinning is expected to be one of the 112 cities selected for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities<sup>[1]</sup>. The project is expected to enhance the synergies between the Horizon Europe Clean Hydrogen Partnership and the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by making optimal use of the information available through the Hydrogen Valley Platform<sup>[2]</sup> and the Cities Mission Platform<sup>[3]</sup>. Under the guidance of the Cities Mission Platform, the selected project will engage in clustering activities with other relevant projects supported under the Cities Mission to promote synergies and complementarities. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing these synergies as well as clustering activities are included in the work-plan.</p><p>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 Communication on EU Missions assessment<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] The EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities aims to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 and ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. On 28 April 2022, the Commission announced the 100 EU cities that will participate in the Mission. In addition, 12 cities have been selected from countries associated or expected to be associated the Horizon Europe programme.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://h2v.eu/\">Mission Innovation Hydrogen Valley Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://netzerocities.eu/\">NetZeroCities</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <sup> </sup>COM(2023) 457 final and SWD(2023) 260 final</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Contribute to the objectives of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality targets in cities and<strong> reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions from transport </strong>due to the improved operation of the multimodal hubs.</li><li><strong>Reduce r</strong><strong>oad congestion and improve air quality </strong>to protect health of citizens and urban biodiversity, by increasing <strong>shift towards sustainable and active modes of transport </strong>for city and intercity trips<strong>.</strong></li><li>Contribute to the objectives of the TEN-T Regulation by enhancing the <strong>climate resilience of multimodal passenger hub infrastructures and services in response </strong>to both the long-term effects of climate change and extreme weather events</li><li>Increase <strong>inclusivity, accessibility and improved experience </strong>for all passengers at multimodal hubs, by proposing mobility solutions that respond to the needs of transports users, irrespective of their age, gender, economic or social status, including equal access for persons with reduced mobility/disabilities.</li><li><strong>Provide guidance and best practices </strong>for national/regional/local authorities and urban transport authorities to improve the integration of walking, cycling, shared mobility and micro-mobility at and around in multimodal-hubs, and for identifying and deploying relevant monitoring and security measures related to climate impact on operations.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic focuses on climate resilience of major multimodal passenger hubs’ infrastructures and services within and between cities as well as peri-urban and rural areas. At least three demonstrators per project are required. As defined in the revised TEN-T regulation<sup>[1]</sup>, ‘multimodal passenger hub’ means a connection point between at least two transport modes for passengers, where travel information, access to public transport and transfers between modes are ensured, such as park-and-ride stations, and which acts as an interface within and between urban nodes and between urban nodes and longer-distance transport networks.</p><p>Projects will complement the implementation of the above requirement for TEN-T urban nodes by demonstrating concrete solutions for improving the climate resilience of multimodal passenger hubs.</p><p>Transport is responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emission and pollution in cities. In addition, transport infrastructures and their operation can be affected by severe disruptions and deterioration caused by extreme events (storms, heavy rains, floodings, heat waves, etc.) or prolonged climate stresses (water scarcity, changing groundwater levels, drought, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and accelerated coastal erosion in coastal cities, etc.). Preparing passenger transport systems resilience and the adaptation capacity is crucial to ensure continuity of the transport service and safety of passengers. The recently published “Support study on the climate adaptation and cross-border investment needs to realise the TEN-T network” should be considered<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should address all the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop and test innovative solutions that increase the number of within-hub flows and access/egress trips by public transport, active, shared and micromobility modes to/from the selected major multi-modal hubs considering improved connectivity, accessibility, fleet rebalancing operations, etc.;</li><li>Identify current and future local climate-related vulnerabilities of the selected multimodal passenger transport infrastructures and services, and determine the potential safety issues and economic and social losses caused by climate change extreme events or longer-term climate stresses that may lead to interrupted or low-quality service;</li><li>Develop and test innovative solutions for climate-resilient multimodal passenger hubs and related transport services for protecting existing infrastructures and/or for building/managing new critical infrastructure capable of mitigating the potential climate change risks, as well as for maintaining services continuity, accessibility and efficiency of operations. In this context:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Develop nature-based solutions for increasing multimodal passenger hub’s infrastructures resilience demonstrating the respective environmental, social, and economic benefits.</li><li>Integrate digital monitoring and advanced yet practical digital and/or AI-based methods for assessing, preventing and managing adverse climate impacts that may affect the multimodal hub operation.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Develop and test solutions to ensure or improve the inclusivity and accessibility of multimodal passenger hubs, accounting for both within-hub flows and access/egress trips, considering that climate change may particularly affect most marginalised populations<sup>[3]</sup> or those in a vulnerable situation;</li><li>Establish co-designing process and engaging with the relevant stakeholders to ensure the successful uptake of the proposed and tested solutions, incl. and economic model, contributing to climate neutrality, climate adaptation and enhanced governance of the multi-modal passenger hubs.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should include activities promoting <strong>the New European Bauhaus principles </strong>(sustainability, aesthetics, and inclusion) among national, regional, and local authorities, citizens, and stakeholders through dedicated local initiatives (e.g. events, contests, citizens’ dialogues, living labs).</p><p>Proposals should be implemented within the framework of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) or equivalent plan of the participating cities.</p><p>Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[4]</sup>. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform and the CIVITAS initiative are included in the work-plan<sup>[5]</sup>.<em> </em> Proposals should plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1679</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/26731a63-b904-11ef-91ed-01aa75ed71a1/language-en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] IPCC 2023</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <u><a href=\"https://civitas.eu/\">https://civitas.eu/</a></u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] The CIVITAS initiative should establish, through a collaboration agreement set up together with the Cities Mission Platform, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.</p>"

In order to master the green and digital transition and make our cities climate-neutral and liveable places, European public procurers need to lead by example by procuring more solutions to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. This topic therefore focuses on forward looking procurement of R&amp;D to bring to the market new solutions to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions that can increase Europe’s resilience and preparedness to tackle the climate challenge.</p><p>Although a PCP action was already included under the Work Programme 2025 (HORIZON-MISS-2026-04-CIT-PCP-01), there is still a need for demand-driven innovation in this area. This topic supports public procurers, specifically local authorities, to collectively implement PCPs to drive innovation from the demand side and open up wider commercialisation opportunities for companies in Europe to take or maintain international leadership in new markets for net-zero technologies that can deliver solutions to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. The aim is to leverage PCP to encourage the development and to provide a first customer reference for the piloting, installation and validation of breakthrough innovations. Actions shall be implemented in compliance with the objectives and the sustainable and resilience public procurement obligations under the Net Zero Industry Act<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>PCP actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&amp;D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.</p><p>Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. cities teams that would need to adopt climate mitigation solutions, regional structures cooperating with cities on climate mitigation, citizens etc.) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project. They should demonstrate how the project is anchored in a clear strategy to provide climate-neutral cities and enhance the economy in a sustainable way through stronger early adoption of innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project.</p><p>Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by local public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will (1) procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP, (2) launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions, (3) adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open source solutions), (4) foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens). In these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP (see general annex H). In the first case, the procurers must foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In the first and third case, the procurers must foresee sufficient time during the project to deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end-users to adopt the solutions, with a maximum budget of EUR 200 000. Projects funded under this topic, which target the higher end of the budget range, should demonstrate a greater degree of ambition in terms of innovation level and/or deployment scope. The selection of the third parties to be supported under the grant will be based on an external review by independent experts of the proposed work.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should include at least three cities of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities<sup>[4]</sup>, and the lead procurer from the buyers group should be one of these 112 cities. In addition to the buyers’ group that will implement the PCP, projects are encouraged to actively cooperate with an additional group of follower cities in the preparation and follow up of the procurement, including possibly also in the testing of solutions, to smoothen faster uptake of solutions to the wider followers group. Collaboration amongst the projects financed under this topic and with the ‘Climate-Neutral Smart cities’ Mission Platform is essential to the increase impact and coherence of the action. Appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration should be included in the work plan of the proposal. The Mission Platform will support cities with the preparatory work for the PCP. The Mission Platform will also support the upscaling and replicability of the developed solutions, and the monitoring of the impact of the projects using a common methodology and clearly established indicators. The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date. To ensure that the new solutions are appropriately identified, the projects should plan for liaising with the different other Horizon funded projects, partnerships and initiatives that promote innovation in the different domains (such as CCAM Partnership, 2ZERO Partnership, and Built4People Partnership, Circular Cities and Regions, and CIVITAS) to avoid overlaps or contradictory conclusions.</p><p>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 Communication on EU Missions assessment<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <em>‘</em>Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy, while preserving an open economy’, as reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf\">Conclusions of the European Council of 1/2 October 2020</a><u>.</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>General Annex H to the work programme provides for specific conditions for PCP such as place of performance and commercialisation conditions that can require the majority of the procured R&amp;D activities and later commercialisation/production of developed solutions to take place in the European Union's Member States and Associated Countries, as well as the possibility to limit the participation to the PCP procurement to economic operators that are established in the European Union's Member States and Associated Countries if there are sufficient economic operators in these territories that can develop the requested solutions.

Current urban logistics systems often rely on disposable packaging and fragmented transport operations, resulting in significant material waste, resource inefficiency and carbon emissions. Addressing these challenges requires innovative circular economy approaches, promoting systemic, innovative, circular and scalable solutions for reducing waste generation, in line with the revised EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR)<sup>[1]</sup>, and improving resource efficiency in business-to-business and business-to-consumer logistics.</p><p>Building on previously funded projects’ outcomes and leveraging potential complementarities with existing regional circularity hubs and other initiatives (e.g. the CCRI <sup>[2]</sup> and its related projects <sup>[3]</sup>, as well as the Driving Urban Transition Partnership (DUT)<sup>[4]</sup>), proposals should address <u>all</u> the following actions:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Design and develop solutions for innovative, modular, reusable, and recyclable packaging and loading units. The proposed solutions should reduce single-use packaging in urban freight transport and demonstrate the benefits of their use in urban logistics processes, while considering the impact of packaging waste regulations on logistics and delivery models in urban areas.</li><li>Develop and test digital tools and systems for tracking and optimising the use of the loading units as well as for secure and efficient stowage, transport, and handling, by integrating technologies such as Internet of Things, edge computing, Artificial Intelligence and data-driven collaboration platforms (e.g. data spaces), considering technological sovereignty and energy-efficiency.</li><li>Engage urban and local stakeholders, including local authorities, logistics operators, retailers and citizens, in co-designing innovative solutions to implement reusable and recyclable packaging and use parcel lockers and micro-hubs (pick-up points) for returning new items and collecting used items (for the purpose of repair, reuse, remanufacture, repurpose or recycling), thus promoting the transition to circular urban logistics in various product value chains.</li><li>Demonstrate the proposed solutions in real-world pilots in at least two different urban environments, each pilot covering two different types of goods or more (e.g. textile apparel, consumer electronics), in cooperation with logistics service providers, cities, and e-commerce value chain actors. Pilots should also consider reverse logistics systems, and innovative return and reuse schemes.</li><li>Explore and evaluate environmental, social, and economic (e.g. need for new business models and incentive schemes) impacts of circular economy approaches and specifically the potential of reverse logistics systems to enable circular flows of materials, reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions, and support reuse schemes.</li><li>In a co-creation process with local authorities, propose policy recommendations and guidelines to support cities in designing enabling regulatory frameworks and market incentives aligned with local circular economy goals and in integrating circular economy principles into urban logistics related policies, plans<sup>[5]</sup> and regulations.</li><li>Provide policy recommendations to facilitate the adoption of modular loading units and the integration of sustainable logistics measures into broader urban circular economy strategies across European cities and regions.</li> </ul><p>Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform – through the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[6]</sup> – and the CCRI is essential. Proposals should include appropriate provisions for activities and resources to support clustering activities and cooperation with the Cities Mission Platform, the CCRI, and the CIVITAS initiative<sup>[7]</sup>.<em> </em> Proposals should also plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the above mentioned initiatives. Moreover, proposals are expected to ensure that their dissemination and exploitation strategies feature dedicated actions for promoting their results and lessons learned across the Cities Mission Platform, CIVITAS and CCRI websites.</p><p>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 Communication on EU Missions assessment<sup>[8]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj/eng\">Regulation - EU - 2025/40 - EN - EUR-Lex</a></u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/\">Circular Cities and Regions Initiative</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <u><a href=\"https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects\">CCRI Projects</a></u> (e.g.<u> <a href=\"https://definite-ccri.eu/nachrichten/rewrap-challenging-dominance-single-use-plastic-wraps\">Rewrap: Challenging the Dominance of Single-Use Plastic Wraps | DEFINITE-CCRI</a>)</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://dutpartnership.eu/the-dut-partnership/\">The DUT Partnership</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5]  E.g. within the <u><a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/urban-transport/sustainable-urban-mobility-planning-and-monitoring_en\">Sustainable urban mobility planning</a></u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <a href=\"https://civitas.eu/\">https://civitas.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] The CIVITAS initiative should establish, through a collaboration agreement set up together with the Cities Mission Platform, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] COM(2023) 457 final and SWD(2023) 260 final</p>"

Of particular interest for this topic are cancers with limited treatment options or unclear biological mechanisms, refractory cancers, rare cancers, early-onset cancers, cancer types with low five-year survival rates, or paediatric and adolescent cancers<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Applicants should take advantage of technological advances in AI tools which open new opportunities to collect, combine and analyse large datasets of diverse types, including multi-omics patient data, tumour molecular profiles, immune profiles, medical images and real word data. Age, sex and gender differences should be duly considered. When relevant, proposals should build on current approaches, standards, data repositories and use modelling assets including but not limited to those provided by the future Advanced VHT Platform<sup>[3]</sup>, the European Open Science Cloud<sup>[4]</sup>, the European 1M+ Genomes<sup>[5]</sup> and the European Cancer Imaging initiatives<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>The applicants should address all of the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To develop innovative, dynamic multiscale VHTs for advancing the mechanistic knowledge and understanding of cancer onset and progression and develop or improve innovative personalised treatments. VHTs should integrate AI tools for the analysis of large volumes of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) multimodal data, increasing their predictive capability and, when appropriate, utilise IT solutions for model visualisation via Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality.</li><li>To update and validate VHTs with longitudinal newly collected or existing FAIR patient data and generate evidence that VHT models can deliver clinically meaningful observations to improve treatment of the studied cancer type, demonstrating VHT accessibility and usability for clinical uptake. The use of data and services provided by ESFRI research infrastructures in the life science domain<sup>[7]</sup> should be considered when appropriate.</li><li>To enrich and make available data and model assets in the UNCAN.eu research platform and in the Advanced VHT Platform following the principles of open science. Newly collected patient datasets must be described with metadata records in the EU dataset catalogue of the European Health Data Space.</li><li>Collaboration among different scientific disciplines, including healthcare professionals and patients throughout all stages of VHTs development is envisaged<sup>[8]</sup>.</li> </ul><p>Successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Understanding' project cluster of the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[9]</sup> and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings and joint activities<sup>[10]</sup>. The Commission will facilitate coordination of this activity.

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed and tailored towards and contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Healthy people and in particular people at risk will benefit from microbiome tests and programmes that can discover and predict their transition to cancer <strong>before </strong>the onset of disease.</li><li>People will have a better understanding of risks and will be enabled to address risks early by following treatments or adapting their lifestyles, including nutrition and other interventions.</li><li>Physicians will be able to start cancer treatments earlier with a higher success rate.</li><li>Policy makers and authorities will be enabled to develop and implement advanced and strategic programmes addressing cancer prevention.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic will contribute to the achievement of the EU Cancer Mission’s objective to achieve better cancer prevention and early<u> </u>detection. The focus is on the development of validated microbiome tools, an assessment of predispositions, the comparison with other predictive tools and risk modelling approaches.</p><p>Cancer often develops over several years and progresses silently before symptoms appear. Some cancers are diagnosed at a very late stage, when the disease is nearly incurable. Early and sensitive biomarkers are beneficial for preventive strategies and the survival of patients especially when tests are minimally invasive and simple to perform. The human microbiome is correlated with this process of oncogenesis and tumour progression. The deterioration of the human microbiome towards dysbiosis should be monitored and used as an early predictive biomarker. The potential of the microbiome should be exploited to deliver important contributions to cancer prevention and early detection strategies before the onset of disease especially for high-risk patients.</p><p>Prevention of cancer through early detection is most efficient in fighting cancer and saving lives. Large microbiome biobanks and registries exist at national and international levels to collect and store microbial samples with the intention to analyse and share microbiome data for research and healthcare. The One Million Microbiomes from Human Project has been launched by several countries to build the largest human microbiome high quality database and to provide advanced life science tools for future healthcare.</p><p>The intention is to accelerate the translation of microbiome knowledge to predict and prevent cancer earlier, before the onset of disease, through the development of personalised approaches and tools. The promise of these tools is evident because people could anticipate cancer while they would still have time to act before the onset of the disease. In case of certain types of cancer, earlier treatment could improve lives or even cure patients in line with the goal of the EU Cancer Mission.</p><p>The tools should be based on the collection of a high number of longitudinal samples over several years, they should be validated and their prediction power compared with other minimally invasive (liquid biopsy) tests. To use the resources most efficiently, the tools should be supported by risk modelling approaches and AI technologies.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of microbiome tools for earlier, better and personalised prediction and prevention of cancer before the onset of the disease; if possible 2 years before the onset of the disease. Proposals should deal with several types of cancer if possible.</li><li>Assessments of predispositions, AI risk modelling approaches and organ/body simulations.</li><li>Collaboration with large cohorts/registries from different communities, usage of existing microbiome and clinical data in combination with and generation of new data. These data could include other predictive signs such as sensations of fatigue, unusual pain, weight loss or other body changes.</li><li>Citizen engagement could be included with data and sample collections as well as educational programmes.</li><li>Comparison with other minimally invasive liquid biopsy and other tests concerning their predictive power, simplicity, cost-benefits and potential for commercialisation.</li><li>Validation of the tests in an independent cohort. Development of guidelines that help to manage risk factors such as lifestyle or diet. The outcome and expertise of ongoing EU and International initatives and the International Cancer Microbiome Consortium could be considered for the reliability of the tests and guidelines to be developed. Age, sex and gender differences should be duly considered.</li> </ul><p>The successful proposal is expected to build on resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer (KCC)<sup>[1]</sup> to foster EU alignment and coordination.</p><p>The successful proposal will be asked to join the 'Prevention and Early Detection' project cluster of the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[2]</sup> and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings and joint activities<sup>[3]</sup>. The Commission will facilitate coordination of these activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). Especially through the ’European Guidelines and Quality Assurance Schemes for Breast, Colorectal and Cervical Cancer Screening and Diagnosis‘, and the ’European Cancer Information System (ECIS)’ and the ’European Cancer Inequalities Registry (ECIR), see https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/cancer_en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In order to address the objectives of the EU Cancer Mission, participants will collaborate in project clusters to leverage EU-funding, increase networking across sectors and disciplines, and establish a portfolio of EU Cancer Mission R&amp;I and policy actions.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] examples of these activities are research or research capacity, organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Proposals are not required to include details of these activities, as they will be defined during the grant agreement preparation and during the life of the project.</p>"

Pragmatic trials evaluate effectiveness of interventions in settings that more closely resemble routine, real-world settings, aiming to produce evidence directly applicable to clinical practice<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should address all the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Conduct randomised or cluster-randomised academic investigator-initiated<sup>[2]</sup> pragmatic clinical trials that benefit patients with refractory cancers - at any stage of the disease, for any cancer subtype, in any age group or part of society - to deliver effective, affordable and tailored immunotherapeutic interventions for implementation by healthcare systems at the level of local communities, European regions, EU Member States and Associated Countries.</li><li>All data should be disaggregated by sex, gender, age and other relevant variables, such as by measures of socio-economic status or ethnicity. Translational research is limited to supporting biomarker-informed patient stratification and the conduct and analyses of the proposed clinical trial(s).</li><li>The primary and secondary endpoints of the pragmatic clinical trials should target overall survival, patient-reported outcomes and quality of life issues considered important by and for cancer patients and their caregivers/families. Such endpoints should be defined together with patients and their caregivers/families through research that stimulates social innovation and supports end-user engagement using participative research models.</li><li>The chosen treatment intervention(s) should be adapted to the particular needs of the target population and to the specificities of the provision of care at local, regional, or national level, duly reflecting the diversity across EU Member States and Associated Countries. Furthermore, affordability and accessibility should be taken into account.</li><li>Applicants should include an appropriate mix of stakeholders from various disciplines, sectors<sup>[3]</sup> and regional as well as national health authorities, and provide details of the clinical study(ies) in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</li> </ul><p>The successful proposals are expected to build on resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer (KCC)<sup>[4]</sup> to foster EU alignment and coordination.</p><p>Successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Diagnosis and Treatment' cluster for the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[5]</sup> and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings, and joint activities<sup>[6]</sup>. The Commission will facilitate coordination of these activities.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Some examples: treatment versus active surveillance in patient management, combination of treatment interventions, determination of optimal dose and dose schedule, de-escalation of treatment intervention, comparative effectiveness of different treatment interventions.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Clinical trials in which a health technology (e.g. a medicinal product, a medical device, an in-vitro diagnostic medical device, a surgical or other medical intervention) is tested in humans, independently from commercial interest and for public health benefits.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] such as physicians, academia, patients and their caregivers, patient representatives, engineers, behavioural scientists, SMEs, business networks, insurance companies, charities and foundations, research organisations, civil society.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] Hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). Especially through the ’European Guidelines and Quality Assurance Schemes for Breast, Colorectal and Cervical Cancer Screening and Diagnosis‘, and the ’European Cancer Information System (ECIS)’ and the ’European Cancer Inequalities Registry (ECIR), see https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/cancer_en</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] To address the objectives of the EU Cancer Mission, participants will collaborate in project clusters to leverage EU-funding, increase networking across sectors and disciplines, and establish a portfolio of EU Cancer Mission R&amp;I and policy actions.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] Examples of those activities are research or research capacity, organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Proposals are not required to include details of these activities, as they will be defined during the grant agreement preparation and during the life of the project.</p>"

The focus is on the development of innovative models for earlier, more precise and better integrated palliative care.</p><p>According to an EU conference on innovative palliative care for people with cancer on 8 October 2024<sup>[1]</sup>, palliative care has big potential but such interventions come much too late and are often imprecise. Palliative care is needed very early after cancer diagnosis with the best possible information on patient wishes and effective communication between all involved carers. Barriers also include the insufficient workforce allocation, insufficient retention and resilience of staff, incorrect transferals between care facilities, regional inequities and higher needs for home-based care. In order to improve the access to palliative care, innovative models for earlier, more precise and more patient-centred care should be developed. These models should be built on patients’ needs and the consideration of all possible care options. They should use AI and digital remote tools to empower clinicians, and to deliver well-integrated care with optimal care predictions.</p><p>Proposals should address most of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop innovative models for earlier, more precise/personalised and integrated palliative care, including digital remote tools, to predict patients’ care preferences, to assign clear roles of carers and to avoid obstacles such as insufficient or inequal access.</li><li>Testing and validation of these models in real-world settings through implementation research and clinical trials. Age, sex and gender differences should be duly considered.</li><li>Attention should be given to address staff training, roles and adherence of conditions.</li><li>Usage of AI and digital remote tools (such as explanatory videos, messaging, etc.) to allow real-time communication and to predict care needs and resources.</li><li>Adoption of guidelines for optimal referrals, efficient and sustainable workforce allocation and retention (access to &amp; dissemination of the guidelines should be provided through the future European Cancer Patient Digital Centre).</li><li>Collaboration with EU4Health projects to create synergies and to facilitate implementation.</li> </ul><p>Successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Quality of Life' project cluster of the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[2]</sup>. and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings and joint activities<sup>[3]</sup>. The Commission will facilitate coordination of these activities.</p><p>Applicants should provide details of the clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/rtd/items/867483/#:~:text=The%20conference%20showcased%20best%20practices%20and%20innovations%20in,and%20sustainable%20solutions%20for%20the%20future%20was%20presented.\">RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - Innovative Palliative Care for People with Cancer Conference</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In order to address the objectives of the EU Cancer Mission, participants will collaborate in project clusters to leverage EU-funding, increase networking across sectors and disciplines, and establish a portfolio of Cancer Mission R&amp;I and policy actions</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] examples of these activities are research or research capacity, organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Proposals are not required to include details of these activities, as they will be defined during the grant agreement preparation and during the life of the project.</p>"

The focus is on the development of innovative models for earlier, more precise and better integrated palliative care.</p><p>According to an EU conference on innovative palliative care for people with cancer on 8 October 2024<sup>[1]</sup>, palliative care has big potential but such interventions come much too late and are often imprecise. Palliative care is needed very early after cancer diagnosis with the best possible information on patient wishes and effective communication between all involved carers. Barriers also include the insufficient workforce allocation, insufficient retention and resilience of staff, incorrect transferals between care facilities, regional inequities and higher needs for home-based care. In order to improve the access to palliative care, innovative models for earlier, more precise and more patient-centred care should be developed. These models should be built on patients’ needs and the consideration of all possible care options. They should use AI and digital remote tools to empower clinicians, and to deliver well-integrated care with optimal care predictions.</p><p>Proposals should address most of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop innovative models for earlier, more precise/personalised and integrated palliative care, including digital remote tools, to predict patients’ care preferences, to assign clear roles of carers and to avoid obstacles such as insufficient or inequal access.</li><li>Testing and validation of these models in real-world settings through implementation research and clinical trials. Age, sex and gender differences should be duly considered.</li><li>Attention should be given to address staff training, roles and adherence of conditions.</li><li>Usage of AI and digital remote tools (such as explanatory videos, messaging, etc.) to allow real-time communication and to predict care needs and resources.</li><li>Adoption of guidelines for optimal referrals, efficient and sustainable workforce allocation and retention (access to &amp; dissemination of the guidelines should be provided through the future European Cancer Patient Digital Centre).</li><li>Collaboration with EU4Health projects to create synergies and to facilitate implementation.</li> </ul><p>Successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Quality of Life' project cluster of the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[2]</sup>. and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings and joint activities<sup>[3]</sup>. The Commission will facilitate coordination of these activities.</p><p>Applicants should provide details of the clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/rtd/items/867483/#:~:text=The%20conference%20showcased%20best%20practices%20and%20innovations%20in,and%20sustainable%20solutions%20for%20the%20future%20was%20presented.\">RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - Innovative Palliative Care for People with Cancer Conference</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In order to address the objectives of the EU Cancer Mission, participants will collaborate in project clusters to leverage EU-funding, increase networking across sectors and disciplines, and establish a portfolio of Cancer Mission R&amp;I and policy actions</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] examples of these activities are research or research capacity, organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate.

In particular:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The digital platform should be developed as a module to be fully integrated within the European Cancer Patient Digital Centre whose information portal is currently under development (project EU-CIP<sup>[2]</sup>). Clear links with EU-CIP should therefore be established and solutions developed to link the two projects, including operational solutions and sustainability.</li><li>The platform should include a mix of innovative personalized, evidence-based, and interactive features building on state-of-the-art research to address the mental health needs of AYA patients and survivors<sup>[3]</sup>. Both cognitive (thinking, reasoning, memory, perceptual etc.), affective (depression, anxiety, etc.), and behaviour change aspects should be considered. </li><li>The innovative nature of proposed solutions should be clearly demonstrated.</li><li>Multi-device compatibility (mobile, tablet, web) and multilingual support to reach diverse populations should be included.</li><li>Specific needs and potential solutions should be discussed and developed in close cooperation with end-users.</li><li>Similarly, the efficacy of the proposed solutions to support and boost mental health of young cancer patients, survivors and their caregivers should be demonstrated by testing and validating them by an appropriate number of end users, with different cancer types and belonging to the targeted age group.</li><li>Develop, test and integrate in the platform innovative tools for collection and analysis of mental health relevant Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) and Patient Reported Experiences Measures (PREMs). Effective mining of lived experience data should be enabled to support for example psychometric development and validation, risk modelling, and the co-creation of personalized psychological measures of mental health. </li><li>Therefore tools should be developed and validated in close cooperation with end-users including patients, survivors, healthcare professionals and researchers.</li><li>Develop European Health Data Space (EHDS) aligned guidelines to report and deposit relevant patient reported data collected with the above tools.</li><li>Projects should include an appropriate mix of stakeholders from various disciplines and sectors, including but not limited to physicians, psychologists, nurses, academia, patients and their caregivers, patient representatives, behavioural scientists, cancer survivorship scientists, AI-experts and solutions providers, SMEs, charities and funding agencies, and research organisations.</li><li>Direct involvement of cancer patients and survivors, survivor representative organisations, caregivers is required, along with effective contribution of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant results, enhancing the impact of the proposed activities.</li><li>Due consideration should be given to initiatives such as: EU-CAYAS-NET<sup>[4]</sup>; ERN PaedCan<sup>[5]</sup>, Pancare<sup>[6]</sup> EUonQoL<sup>[7]</sup>, e-Quol<sup>[8]</sup> and other relevant initiatives, including projects funded under the EU Cancer Mission topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CANCER-01-05: Improving the understanding and management of late-effects in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer<sup>[9]</sup>.</li> </ul><p>Successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Quality of life” cluster for the EU Cancer Mission<sup>[10]</sup> and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings, and joint activities<sup>[11]</sup>.

The country has also one of the highest childhood cancer mortality rates globally<sup>[2]</sup>. Disparities in access and quality of cancer care in Ukraine were high before Russia's unprovoked aggression and worsened because of the conflict, which has also led to increased cancer mortality and morbidity, due to discontinuation of treatments and shortage of medical supplies.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following:</p><p>A research capacity-building programme should be set up between EU Member States/Associated Countries and Ukraine, in order to support Ukraine to develop or to further improve research &amp; innovation-related capacities of future or existing Cancer Infrastructures.</p><p>The capacity building programme should include the following components:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of a joint-research training programme, including distance-learning modules</li><li>Twinning research activities, including staff-exchange for the implementation of targeted research projects and access to cutting-edge services</li> </ul><p>The capacity building programme should cover at least the following areas;</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced involvement in quality scientific research, including development and implementation of clinical trials and other epidemiological studies and related training<sup>[3]</sup>;</li><li>Better integration of research and care to improve patient outcomes. Particular emphasis should be given to cancer in children, adolescents and young adults;</li><li>Improvement of digital capacity to support primary and secondary use of patient data, including through improvement of data exchange capacities<sup>[4]</sup> and development of cancer registries where needed.</li> </ul><p>Gender-related aspects, with respect to representation in research and career pathways and any other relevant aspects, should be duly taken into account.</p><p>The research capacity-building programme should be tailored to the needs of the participating entities. This concerns in particular the required participants / stakeholder groups, duly reflecting health and research system specificities. The training module shall consist of balanced theoretical and practical parts, including simulations, case studies, group exercises, mutual learning exercises and on-site visits (when possible) to gather practical experience. Safety of participating staff/researchers should be prioritised.</p><p>Advantage should be taken to the extent possible of experience gained under current and previous initiatives such as CCI4EU<sup>[5]</sup>, Jane<sup>[6]</sup>, Jane 2<sup>[7]</sup>, Crane<sup>[8]</sup>, CanSERV<sup>[9]</sup> and others. The relevant EU research infrastructures in the life science domain<sup>[10]</sup> and other EU initiatives should be exploited for available research services, as appropriate.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/populations/804-ukraine-fact-sheet.pdf\">04-ukraine-fact-sheet.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/351857/9789289057615-eng.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y\">9789289057615-eng.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Topics to be covered include but are not limited to study design, process of trial approval, ethical aspects, recruitment, staffing and training requirements including digital skills, data management and data analysis, organisational aspects, regulatory requirements, clinical core facilities, patient participation and empowerment</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <em>e.g. </em>interoperability of standards, data protection related aspects and others as appropriate</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://www.cci4eu.eu/\">CCI4EU</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] S<a href=\"https://jane-project.eu/\">haping the EU Networksof Expertise on cancer!</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <a href=\"https://jane-2.eu/\">Home - Jane 2</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <a href=\"https://crane4health.eu/\">CraNE4Health European Network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <a href=\"https://www.canserv.eu/\">canSERV - Cutting Edge Cancer Research Services Across Europe</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <a href=\"https://lifescience-ri.eu/home.html\">Home | LifeScience</a></p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed and tailored towards and contribute to the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved understanding of care needs of older patients with cancer and approaches to address them;</li><li>Older cancer patients gain access to innovative age-specific approaches and tools better tailored to their care needs;</li><li>National healthcare providers, policymakers and authorities in European regions, EU Member States and Associated Countries have the evidence to implement tailored care for older cancer patients that have the potential to be implemented in routine treatment and follow-up care in their healthcare systems;</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic contributes to the EU Cancer Mission’s objective to improve quality of life of cancer patients. The focus is on cancer patients aged 65 years and above.</p><p>Currently, older cancer patients represent the largest proportion of cancer patients especially in Europe, with more than two thirds of new cancer cases being diagnosed in patients above the age of 65. Yet, there is still relatively little knowledge about their functional health and care needs during and after treatment.</p><p>Managing cancer in older patients is complex, due to the high heterogeneity in terms of their intrinsic health capacities, including mental health and cognitive capacities, comorbidities, frailty etc. as well as with regard to their performance activities including social interactions, work, mobility etc. Consequently, overall health care needs of older patients with cancer vary significantly.</p><p>Older cancer patients are consistently underrepresented in clinical research, with representation declining progressively with increasing age. This leads to a lack of knowledge regarding treatments, specific needs, and clinical endpoints. Older patients are also particularly vulnerable to treatment toxicities loss of muscle mass, and may experience a large variety of confounding comorbidities and symptoms, which strongly impact their quality of life during and after treatment.</p><p>As such, quality of life expectations should be systematically factored in the decision process to define the optimal approach to cancer management.</p><p>The overall goal of this topic is to advance the understanding of older cancer patients' care needs, and develop innovative, age-sensitive care approaches and tools to boost overall quality of life. In particular:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building on data from existing or newly established cohorts provide a thorough assessment of QoL needs and relevant dimensions in older patients, taking into account aspects such as social and health determinants, including sex, gender, age, comorbidities, intrinsic and functional health status, socio-economic status, living in rural or remote areas, education, access/reachability to disease management programs (due to travel distances and abilities) etc.</li><li>Develop, test, implement and scale up innovative, holistic approaches and tools in real-life settings (e.g. through the implementation of pragmatic clinical trials or effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs) to optimize treatment and/or follow-up regimens for older patients, aiming to reduce comorbidities, impairments and frailty, while improving overall quality of life. Prehabilitation strategies (e.g. to be delivered after diagnosis but prior to treatment) should be also considered. The development of these approaches and tools should consider the potential gender-related differences in treatment outcomes and quality of life, such as the impact of hormonal changes, or caregiving responsibilities.</li><li>Primary and secondary endpoints of the pragmatic clinical trial(s) should support patient-reported outcomes and quality of life. Such endpoints should be defined together with patients and their caregivers through research that stimulates social innovation and supports end-user engagement using participative research models.</li><li>Particular attention should be given to aspects such as pain management, cognitive and social support, mental health services etc. Additionally, rehabilitation tackling common concerns such as reduced mobility, osteoporosis, cardiovascular health, neurocognitive changes, sleep disturbance, loss of independence, time and financial toxicity etc, essential for maintaining good quality of life, should also be addressed. Health literacy including digital literacy could also be considered.

To achieve this, there is a need for tools, solutions and associated business models with market potential that facilitate the adoption of inclusive circular construction economy models, as well as a more efficient use of buildings, ultimately reducing the need to extract raw materials.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop and demonstrate tools and solutions at district or city level to support the introduction of circularity principles in the construction sector, and quantify their impacts (for example: urban mining; reuse and recycling of construction products and materials and other resources, use of secondary biobased materials; building’s innovative, accessible and adaptive design, renovation, and repurposing of buildings in line with waste prevention and circular economy principles).</li><li>Develop and demonstrate solutions for the diagnosis and performance characterisation of used construction products and demolition waste, in terms of their condition and potential reuse, and to create inventories of reclaimed products and materials, as well as appropriate business models including marketplace tools with components and material banks.</li><li>Develop and demonstrate whole life-cycle GHG emissions inventories of buildings to support decision-making and public actions in line with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) recast.</li><li>Contribute to reducing regulatory barriers and developing standards, where relevant.</li><li>Ensure the integration of different value chains, active involvement of all relevant construction sector stakeholders, policy-makers and the people impacted by the solutions developed, including SMEs, building owners, local authorities and civil society.</li><li>Demonstrate the proposed tools and solutions in at least three cities, each from a different Member State or Associated Country, including with a view to showcase potential for large scale cross-border re-use of construction materials and products. The cities must participate as beneficiaries. At least one of the three cities must be one of the 112 cities participating in the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities.<em> </em></li> </ul><p>Given its focus on circularity, this topic contributes to the implementation of the Cities Mission, the New European Bauhaus (NEB), the European Partnership on 'People-centric Sustainable Built Environment' (B4P), and the EU Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI).</p><p>Projects are encouraged to engage in clustering activities with other relevant Horizon Europe projects that share a common theme and address similar issues, and/or are connected to the aforementioned initiatives. This approach aims to promote synergies and complementarities. To this end, proposals should include a dedicated task, allocate appropriate resources, and develop a plan for collaboration with relevant projects, partners, and initiatives. Moreover, proposals are expected to ensure that their dissemination and exploitation strategies feature dedicated (and possibly joint) actions for promoting their results and lessons learned on relevant platforms, such as the Cities Mission Platform, the NEB hub for results and impact, B4P<sup>[2]</sup> and CCRI<sup>[3]</sup> websites, and through related channels. Such activities will facilitate knowledge exchange, encourage the replication and uptake of solutions, and maximise impact.</p><p>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 Communication on EU Missions assessment<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <u> See Article 2(24) of Directive (EU) 2024/1275</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <u> https://built4people.eu/b4pic_network/</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <u>https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/ccri-projects</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <u>COM(2023) 457 final and SWD(2023) 260 final</u></p>"

Assessments will provide critical data to support adaptive management practices that optimise soil health enhancing competitiveness and resilience.</p><p>Soil analyses are subject to variabilities arising from sampling methods, handling and transport of soil samples, variations in laboratory equipment and calibration, lack of standardised testing methods, human error, and the natural variability of soil properties. Moreover, farmers and land managers usually lack a comprehensive understanding of soil health indicators. This undermines their ability to accurately interpret soil analysis results and implement effective interventions, like adjusting fertilisation practices or crop rotation strategies. Limited training in proper sampling techniques and the use of modern diagnostic tools further hinders their ability to make informed decisions and manage soil health effectively. To address these gaps, it is essential to implement rigorous protocols and training for laboratory personnel, as well as enhance farmers’ and land managers’ decision-making capabilities.</p><p>Reliable soil data is also crucial as it underpins models predicting future soil health scenarios, supports the formulation of evidence-based policies and enhances decision-making processes for sustainable land management.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>organise networking and capacity-building activities to equip stakeholders, mainly land managers, laboratory personnel and advisors, with practical tools and skills to improve soil data quality and soil data interpretation;</li><li>compile and promote (standardised) methods and protocols for soil sampling (timing, depth, tools, representativeness, uncertainties), soil analysis (equipment, calibrations, inter-comparisons, uncertainties), and for the design of soil health monitoring programmes;</li><li>facilitate and promote the integration of soil data, datasets and databases from different sources and methods allowing for the combination of results from direct sampling, proximal and remote sensing and other state-of-the-art methodologies;</li><li>identify and promote existing (and, if missing, develop) practical tools (such as guides or apps) on soil analysis and monitoring: indicators, sampling and analysis methods, data management and analysis, interpretation of results, etc., based on solid scientific expertise with emphasis on new methods and technologies;</li><li>conduct activities, such as case studies or piloting collaborative platforms to explore opportunities and limitations of soil data sharing (privacy, fragmentation, lack of standardisation and reference framework, IPRs, interoperability, restricted access policies);</li><li>actively interact or collaborate with relevant standardisation bodies establishing communication and cooperation to ensure that the standards being developed or applied meet the needs of stakeholders and align with existing regulations.</li> </ul><p>The resources and opportunities offered by the project must be accessible to stakeholders even if they are not involved in the project as partners, contributing to address existing imbalances in soil analysis and data availability across the EU.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission Soil. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives<sup>[1]</sup> and engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p><strong>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 </strong><a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/communication-commission-eu-missions-two-years-assessment-progress-and-way-forward\">Communication on EU Missions assessment</a>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Such as projects working on soil indicators like <a href=\"https://mrv4soc.eu/demo-sites/grassland-pasture/\">MRV4SOC</a>, <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101091010\">BENCHMARKS</a>, those working with farmers and citizens such as <a href=\"https://echosoil.eu/\">Echo Horizon - EchoSoil</a>, while also considering integrated platforms such as <a href=\"https://tudi-project.org/\">TUdi Homepage</a>.</p>"

            "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Activities under this topic respond directly to the goal of the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/soil-deal-europe_en\">Mission Soil</a> to set up 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition to healthy soils by 2030. They support the specific objectives of the Mission Soil<sup>[1]</sup>. Activities should also contribute to the Common Agricultural Policy and to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets and more specifically those of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52020DC0380\">EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0699\">EU Soil Strategy for 2030</a> and the <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/soil-and-land/soil-health_en\">proposal for a Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive</a>, the <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">Zero Pollution Action Plan</a>, the <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3f4c4d4a-287e-11ef-a195-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Communication on Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU</a>, as well as to Sustainable Development Goals<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to <u>all</u> the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>enhanced capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&amp;I to co-create and co-implement economically viable soil health solutions;</li><li>improved soil health monitoring and increased availability of high quality, standardised soil data at local and regional level;</li><li>increased availability of practice-oriented knowledge for land managers and land users, leading to better adoption of effective soil health solutions in diverse contexts;</li><li>policy makers are more aware of local needs regarding soil health, including the factors that influence it, and can use this knowledge to design and implement more effective policies to enhance soil health, while considering the economic sustainability of solutions.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The Mission Soil proposes the deployment of living labs as a novel approach to research and innovation in soil health<sup>[3]</sup>. Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance. Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[5]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Living labs can address soil health challenges in or across different land uses (agricultural, (peri-)urban, (post)-industrial, forest and (semi-)natural). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Individual sites can be farms, forest holdings, urban green areas<sup>[6]</sup>, industrial areas, etc. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start a participatory process or build on existing ones. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results. While on average, projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects under this topic should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soil processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common shared soil health challenge(s) within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs either in the Alpine or in the Atlantic biogeographical region<sup>[7]</sup>. Proposals must clearly indicate which of these two biogeographical regions they focus on and must establish the majority of the living labs within the chosen biogeographical region. Living labs under each proposal should work together on common soil health challenge(s) relevant to the selected biogeographical region. The living labs must be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs and how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>[8]</sup>. Proposals with <u>all</u> living labs focusing on soil heath on forests or natural/semi-natural land types are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme (HORIZON-MISS-2026-05-SOIL-02-two-stage: Living labs to enhance soil health in managed forests and in natural/semi-natural lands);</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, strategies, etc.) for the common soil health challenge(s) taking into account relevant soil health drivers and pressures<sup>[9]</sup>. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating;</li><li>establish for each living lab a baseline of the soil conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitor improvements on soil health and ecosystem associated services. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis; proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to the addressed soil health challenge(s), pedoclimatic conditions, land use, and other local/regional factors;</li><li>assess and demonstrate the technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>identify high performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution from social sciences, humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer and socio-cultural and behavioural change.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP), which facilitates active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, SMEs or civil society) in a project’s living labs, can be provided through calls, or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes, including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities and regular monitoring activities of living labs performance. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale, or within other Horizon projects, including those funded under the Mission Soil. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives, as well as participation in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities. Proposals are also encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures (<a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">ESFRI</a>), and to cooperate with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on <a href=\"https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/\">Agroecology</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.foodpaths.eu/sfs-partnership/\">Sustainable Food Systems</a> and/or relevant local and active networks, such as the EIP-AGRI operational groups, to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>To ensure that both biogeographical regions are covered (Atlantic and Alpine), grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but also to at least one project focusing on each of these two biogeographical regions, provided that proposals attain all thresholds.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">Mission implementation plan</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In particular SDG 3- Good health and well-being, and SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-publications-tools-and-data/publications/all-publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">Implementation Plans for the EU Missions - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4]  <a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/soill-catalogue-2024-mission-soil-living-labs-and-lighthouses\">Catalogue 2024 - Mission Soil Living Labs and Lighthouses| Mission Soil Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>In this topic, it is recommended to define the living labs location using the NUTS2 division (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/statistical-atlas/viewer/?config=RYB-2024.json&amp;mids=BKGCNT,NUTS2,CNTOVL&amp;o=1,1,0.7&amp;ch=C01,C02,C03,C04,C05,C06,C07,C08,C09,C10,C11,C12&amp;center=43.5714,28.35678,4&amp;lcis=NUTS2&amp;\">Eurostat Statistical Atlas</a> ; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2003/1059/oj/eng\">Regulation - 1059/2003 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>By urban green areas, we refer to green spaces in cities such as parks, gardens, green roofs or walls, green corridors, squares, recreational areas, etc.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/maps-and-charts/biogeographical-regions-in-europe-2\">Biogeographical regions in Europe</a> according to the European Environmental Agency.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>Mission Soil specific objectives: reduce land degradation relating to desertification; conserve and increase soil organic carbon stocks, no net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils; reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration; prevent erosion; improve soil structure to enhance habitat quality for soil biota and crops; reduce the EU global footprint on soils; increase soil literacy in society.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup>See <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/10693699\">Soil Needs and Drivers of Change Across Europe and Land Use Types - Booklet</a> from PREPSOIL project</p>"

Soil microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) have been crucial in the discovery of antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. However, soils can also be a hotspot for antimicrobial resistance development and can play a key role in the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between organisms and environmental compartments. Antibiotic use is expected to increase globally due to the rising demand for food-producing animals, which may further exacerbate the development of antimicrobial resistance in soils. According to the World Health Organization, antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to public health<sup>[2]</sup>. The driving forces for antimicrobial resistance development in soils are however understudied, as well as the role of soils in the exposure of humans and animals to antimicrobial resistance determinants. Moreover, our knowledge of antibiotics-related genes is currently limited, making it challenging to identify new compounds of interest. To better understand and combat antimicrobial resistance development in soils, a One-Health approach is needed.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>explore the source and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance development and the mechanisms for antibiotic biosynthesis in soils across all relevant land use types. The role of land use, land management practices and other environmental and anthropogenic driving factors should be identified and taken into account;</li><li>analyse the role of soils in the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes among organisms and environmental compartments and in the exposure of humans and animals to antimicrobial resistance genes and organisms;</li><li>expand databases of antibiotics-related genes and antibiotic alternatives from soil microorganisms;</li><li>develop concrete guidelines for policymakers and land managers to: i) better address the exposure of humans and animals to antimicrobial resistant genes and organisms; and, ii) facilitate the discovery of new molecules of pharmaceutical interest;</li><li>carry out communication and awareness raising activities targeted to citizens on the importance of soil and soil biodiversity for human, animal and environmental health as well as on their potential as a source of molecules of interest for pharmaceutical purposes.</li> </ul><p>In carrying out the activities, consortia should work in an interdisciplinary way bringing together life sciences, environmental sciences, health sciences and veterinary sciences.</p><p>Proposals are expected to collaborate with the projects funded under HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-09-01: European Partnership: One Health Anti-Microbial Resistance. Proposals should also demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">EU Soil Observatory</a> and the <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112838\">SoilWise</a> project.

In Europe, forests cover nearly 40% of the total land area, with over 90% classified as managed forests, where human activities such as timber production, habitat management, recreation, etc. take place<sup>[3]</sup>. Maintaining and enhancing soil functions in managed forests is essential for ensuring both their productivity and long-term resilience. In this context, developing a sustainable forest bioeconomy is strategically important for Europe’s green transition.</p><p>The remaining 5–10% of Europe’s forested land consists of unmanaged or natural forests, such as those within national parks or nature reserves. Monitoring the state of soil health in these natural forests lands as well as in any other natural areas<sup>[4]</sup> across Europe, is essential for their conservation as, despite the minimal or absence of human intervention, they remain vulnerable to degradation processes originating from surrounding managed lands and diffuse pollution. Early detection of such risks is critical to allow for prevention and remediation.</p><p>The Mission Soil proposes the deployment of living labs as a novel approach to research and innovation in soil health<sup>[5]</sup>. Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[7]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Living labs under this topic can address soil health challenges in or across two land uses: managed forest or natural/semi-natural lands. Individual sites can be park plots, nature reserves parcels, protected areas, etc., where work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start a participatory process or build on existing ones. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results. While on average projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soil processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common soil health challenge(s) of the selected land use within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs to work together on shared soil health challenge(s) affecting either managed forests or natural/semi-natural types<sup>[8]</sup>. Proposals must clearly indicate which of one of these two land types they focus on. Living labs under each proposal should work on common soil health challenge(s) relevant to the selected land type. The living labs must be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs and how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>15</sup>;</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, strategies, etc.) for the common soil health challenge(s) on managed forests or natural/semi-natural soils, taking into account relevant soil health drivers and pressures<sup>[9]</sup>. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating;</li><li>establish for each living lab a baseline of the soil conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitor improvements on soil health and related ecosystem services. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis. Proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to the addressed soil health challenge(s), pedoclimatic conditions, and other local/regional factors within the chosen land use;</li><li>assess and demonstrate their technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>identify high performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later, during the project implementation. Engage with SOILL<sup>[10]</sup> project to assess the growth and development of these lighthouses and to support the establishment of a labelling process that could formally recognize these exemplary sites as lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, foresters, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, residents, environmental NGOs, youth or other community organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution of social sciences and humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer and socio-cultural and behavioural change.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, foresters, SMEs or civil society) in the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls, or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities, regular monitoring activities<u> </u>on living labs performance and lighthouses growth assessment. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission Soil. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with relevant projects and initiatives carrying out relevant activities under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including those funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-06: Improving grassland management in European livestock farming systems and topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-01-two-stage: Living labs co-creating innovative solutions for forests and freshwater ecosystems restoration. Proposals are also encouraged to engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities and to cooperate with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on Forests and/or relevant networks active at local level, such as the EIP-AGRI operational groups to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders. Lastly, proposals should consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures (<a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">ESFRI</a>).</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>To ensure that both land types are covered (managed forests and natural/semi-natural), grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but also to at least one project focusing on each of these two land types, provided that proposals attain all thresholds.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In particular SDG 3- Good health and well-being, and SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://holisoils.eu/soil-benefits/\">Soil benefits - HoliSoils</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://foresteurope.org/\">Home Forest Europe - FOREST EUROPE</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1992/43/oj/eng\">Directive - 92/43 - EN - Habitats Directive - EUR-Lex</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-publications-tools-and-data/publications/all-publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">Implementation Plans for the EU Missions - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6]  <a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/soill-catalogue-2024-mission-soil-living-labs-and-lighthouses\">Catalogue 2024 - Mission Soil Living Labs and Lighthouses| Mission Soil Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>In this topic, it is recommended to define the living labs location using the NUTS2 division (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/statistical-atlas/viewer/?config=RYB-2024.json&amp;mids=BKGCNT,NUTS2,CNTOVL&amp;o=1,1,0.7&amp;ch=C01,C02,C03,C04,C05,C06,C07,C08,C09,C10,C11,C12&amp;center=43.5714,28.35678,4&amp;lcis=NUTS2&amp;\">Eurostat Statistical Atlas</a> ; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2003/1059/oj/eng\">Regulation - 1059/2003 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>An ecosystem with most of its processes and biodiversity intact, though altered by human activity in strength or abundance relative to the natural state (IPBES)</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/10693699\">Soil Needs and Drivers of Change Across Europe and Land Use Types - Booklet</a> from PREPSOIL project</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <sup> </sup><a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">www.soill2030.eu/about-us</a></p>"

In Europe, forests cover nearly 40% of the total land area, with over 90% classified as managed forests, where human activities such as timber production, habitat management, recreation, etc. take place<sup>[3]</sup>. Maintaining and enhancing soil functions in managed forests is essential for ensuring both their productivity and long-term resilience. In this context, developing a sustainable forest bioeconomy is strategically important for Europe’s green transition.</p><p>The remaining 5–10% of Europe’s forested land consists of unmanaged or natural forests, such as those within national parks or nature reserves. Monitoring the state of soil health in these natural forests lands as well as in any other natural areas<sup>[4]</sup> across Europe, is essential for their conservation as, despite the minimal or absence of human intervention, they remain vulnerable to degradation processes originating from surrounding managed lands and diffuse pollution. Early detection of such risks is critical to allow for prevention and remediation.</p><p>The Mission Soil proposes the deployment of living labs as a novel approach to research and innovation in soil health<sup>[5]</sup>. Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[7]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Living labs under this topic can address soil health challenges in or across two land uses: managed forest or natural/semi-natural lands. Individual sites can be park plots, nature reserves parcels, protected areas, etc., where work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start a participatory process or build on existing ones. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results. While on average projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soil processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common soil health challenge(s) of the selected land use within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs to work together on shared soil health challenge(s) affecting either managed forests or natural/semi-natural types<sup>[8]</sup>. Proposals must clearly indicate which of one of these two land types they focus on. Living labs under each proposal should work on common soil health challenge(s) relevant to the selected land type. The living labs must be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs and how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>15</sup>;</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, strategies, etc.) for the common soil health challenge(s) on managed forests or natural/semi-natural soils, taking into account relevant soil health drivers and pressures<sup>[9]</sup>. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating;</li><li>establish for each living lab a baseline of the soil conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitor improvements on soil health and related ecosystem services. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis. Proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to the addressed soil health challenge(s), pedoclimatic conditions, and other local/regional factors within the chosen land use;</li><li>assess and demonstrate their technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>identify high performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later, during the project implementation. Engage with SOILL<sup>[10]</sup> project to assess the growth and development of these lighthouses and to support the establishment of a labelling process that could formally recognize these exemplary sites as lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, foresters, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, residents, environmental NGOs, youth or other community organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution of social sciences and humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer and socio-cultural and behavioural change.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, foresters, SMEs or civil society) in the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls, or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities, regular monitoring activities<u> </u>on living labs performance and lighthouses growth assessment. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission Soil. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with relevant projects and initiatives carrying out relevant activities under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including those funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-06: Improving grassland management in European livestock farming systems and topic HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-BIODIV-01-two-stage: Living labs co-creating innovative solutions for forests and freshwater ecosystems restoration. Proposals are also encouraged to engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities and to cooperate with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on Forests and/or relevant networks active at local level, such as the EIP-AGRI operational groups to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders. Lastly, proposals should consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures (<a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">ESFRI</a>).</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>To ensure that both land types are covered (managed forests and natural/semi-natural), grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but also to at least one project focusing on each of these two land types, provided that proposals attain all thresholds.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] In particular SDG 3- Good health and well-being, and SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://holisoils.eu/soil-benefits/\">Soil benefits - HoliSoils</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://foresteurope.org/\">Home Forest Europe - FOREST EUROPE</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1992/43/oj/eng\">Directive - 92/43 - EN - Habitats Directive - EUR-Lex</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-publications-tools-and-data/publications/all-publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">Implementation Plans for the EU Missions - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6]  <a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/soill-catalogue-2024-mission-soil-living-labs-and-lighthouses\">Catalogue 2024 - Mission Soil Living Labs and Lighthouses| Mission Soil Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup>In this topic, it is recommended to define the living labs location using the NUTS2 division (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/statistical-atlas/viewer/?config=RYB-2024.json&amp;mids=BKGCNT,NUTS2,CNTOVL&amp;o=1,1,0.7&amp;ch=C01,C02,C03,C04,C05,C06,C07,C08,C09,C10,C11,C12&amp;center=43.5714,28.35678,4&amp;lcis=NUTS2&amp;\">Eurostat Statistical Atlas</a> ; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2003/1059/oj/eng\">Regulation - 1059/2003 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>An ecosystem with most of its processes and biodiversity intact, though altered by human activity in strength or abundance relative to the natural state (IPBES)</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/10693699\">Soil Needs and Drivers of Change Across Europe and Land Use Types - Booklet</a> from PREPSOIL project</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <sup> </sup><a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">www.soill2030.eu/about-us</a></p>"

Activities should also contribute to the implementation of the <u><a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/soil-health/soil-health_en\">Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive</a></u> after its adoption.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to <u>all</u> the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>enhanced adoption of impactful sustainable soil management solutions and strategies supported by AI-powered decision support systems by land managers;</li><li>harmonised, standard, robust, interoperable and accessible methods, protocols and logical architecture for long-term field experiments (LTEs) data collection and integration (including with other datasets) are in place;</li><li>scientists, policymakers, and land managers gain enhanced access to comprehensive, high-quality soil data, enabling better research, informed decision-making, and effective land management practices.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Long-term field experiments (LTEs) can be defined as “agricultural experiments for monitoring soil and crop properties under changing climate conditions and different management with a minimum duration of 20 years”<sup>[1]</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>[2]</sup>. LTEs are typically owned or managed by public research institutions.</p><p>Long-term field experiments provide valuable information on soil health and sustainable soil management practices and can be considered critical infrastructure for agricultural research. However, LTEs present some limitations or needs to maximize their impact.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>There is a need for standardized methods in collecting and reporting soil data to ensure consistency and comparability across different studies and regions.</li><li>Opportunities exist to integrate soil data from long-term field experiments with other data sources (including the Mission Soil projects results, but not only) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of soil health dynamics and trend, as well as response to policies and management strategies.</li><li>Enhancing the accessibility and interoperability of soil data across platforms and sources can facilitate collaborative research and accelerate advancements in soil health management.</li><li>More high-resolution temporal and spatial data are needed to capture short-term soil dynamics and site-specific variations that can influence broader interpretations of soil health trends. </li> </ul><p>On the other hand, independent advisory services on soil health for land managers often face challenges such as limited access to comprehensive data, variability in expertise, and the inability to provide tailored recommendations specific to diverse local conditions. These services may struggle with integrating complex and dynamic factors that influence soil health, leading to generic advice that may not effectively address specific needs. There is an opportunity in utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse vast, complex soil data sets, extract meaningful patterns, and develop predictive models that can enhance the quality of advice provided, improving decision-making, and fostering more effective, sustainable soil management practices.</p><p>Proposed activities should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>design and implement standardised protocols and procedures for harmonised soil data collection, ensuring consistency and comparability, from different LTEs and regions across the EU and Horizon Europe Associated Countries;</li><li>develop robust frameworks for integrating LTE data with other relevant soil health datasets, including outputs from Mission Soil projects, to create comprehensive soil health databases;</li><li>develop open-access and user-friendly interoperable systems and platforms to improve data sharing and accessibility, allowing researchers, advisors, land managers and other stakeholders to easily access and utilize comprehensive soil health information;</li><li>build a network of at least 50 LTEs covering most representative pedo-climatic regions in the EU and Associated Countries involving at least 7 owning institutions, to test and validate the developed infrastructure;</li><li>promote the use of the developed infrastructure for widespread collection and integration of as many as possible soil-health relevant databases (LTEs and others) by, for example, developing intuitive interfaces and user-friendly platforms, partnering with relevant organizations managing LTEs and/or generating datasets, demonstration projects, feedback and improvement loops or training and support services;</li><li>develop AI-driven tools to analyze integrated datasets (including publicly available such as CORDIS, SoilWise repository or repositories like Zenodo), extracting meaningful patterns, and generating predictive models that inform soil health dynamics and management strategies;</li><li>examine potentially correlated explanatory covariates and their relative contribution to the outcome to facilitate spatial downscaling and forecasting in data poor regions and areas by using pre-trained deep learning models;</li><li>develop and train open-source and/or modular AI components, providing comprehensive documentation and tutorials, and establish and nurture open-source communities by, for example, hosting hackathons, workshops, or online platforms to encourage the development, sharing, and integration of the developed modular AI components into commercial applications for land managers and advisors, with a focus on small-scale producers;</li><li>mine large data from publicly available databases (e.g. CORDIS, SoilWise repository or repositories like Zenodo) to pre-train deep learning models and artificial intelligence mobile apps that will facilitate real-time soil status assessments.</li> </ul><p>The project(s) must implement the multi-actor approach<strong> </strong>and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and all relevant actors (landowners, farmers, scientists, advisors, local/regional/national public authorities) throughout the different stages of project development and implementation. Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to incentivise and support third-party developers to create or improve innovative AI-powered applications that deliver tailored advice to farmers and advisors, enhancing soil management practices and benefiting small-scale producers.</p><p>Proposals should build on the work done by the <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a> project and collaborate with the <u><a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">EU Soil Observatory</a></u>.</p><p>Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with other Mission Soil relevant projects developing soil information systems, in particular project <u><a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101218840\">African Union Soil Observatory</a></u> (AUSO), and other projects that are being funded by other entities in the EU, Horizon Europe Associated Countries and in Africa, including philanthropic organisations.

Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance. Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[5]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Living labs can address soil health challenges in or across different land uses (agricultural, (peri-)urban, (post)-industrial, forest and (semi-)natural). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Individual sites can be farms, forest holdings, urban green<sup>[6]</sup> areas, industrial areas, etc. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start the participatory process or build on existing ones. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results. While on average, projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects under this topic should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soils processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common shared soil health challenge(s) within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs either in the Continental biogeographical region or in one or more of the following three biogeographical regions: Black Sea, Pannonian and Steppic<sup>[7]</sup>. Proposals must clearly indicate their focus and should establish the majority of the living labs within the chosen focus biogeographical region or region(s). Living labs under each proposal should work together on common soil health challenge(s) relevant to the selected biogeographical region or region(s). The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs and how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>[8]</sup>. Proposals with <u>all</u> living labs working on soil management practices to decrease eutrophication within a specific river catchment area, are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme <u>(</u>HORIZON-MISS-2027-05-SOIL-02-two-stage: Living Labs for co-creating solutions to reduce eutrophication from agriculture);</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, strategies, etc.) for the common soil health challenge(s) taking into account relevant soil health drivers and pressures<sup>[9]</sup>. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating;</li><li>establish, for each living lab, a baseline of the soil conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitor improvements on soil health and associated ecosystem services. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis; proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to the addressed soil health challenge(s), pedoclimatic conditions, land use, and other local/regional factors;</li><li>assess and demonstrate the technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>identify high performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later. Engage with <a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a> to assess the growth and development of these lighthouses and to support the establishment of a labelling process that could formally recognize these exemplary sites as lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution of social sciences and humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer and socio-cultural and behavioural change.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls, or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with <a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities and regular monitoring activities<u> </u>on living labs performance. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives and engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities.

Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance. Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[5]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Living labs can address soil health challenges in or across different land uses (agricultural, (peri-)urban, (post)-industrial, forest and (semi-)natural). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Individual sites can be farms, forest holdings, urban green<sup>[6]</sup> areas, industrial areas, etc. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start the participatory process or build on existing ones. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results. While on average, projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects under this topic should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soils processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common shared soil health challenge(s) within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs either in the Continental biogeographical region or in one or more of the following three biogeographical regions: Black Sea, Pannonian and Steppic<sup>[7]</sup>. Proposals must clearly indicate their focus and should establish the majority of the living labs within the chosen focus biogeographical region or region(s). Living labs under each proposal should work together on common soil health challenge(s) relevant to the selected biogeographical region or region(s). The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs and how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>[8]</sup>. Proposals with <u>all</u> living labs working on soil management practices to decrease eutrophication within a specific river catchment area, are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme <u>(</u>HORIZON-MISS-2027-05-SOIL-02-two-stage: Living Labs for co-creating solutions to reduce eutrophication from agriculture);</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, strategies, etc.) for the common soil health challenge(s) taking into account relevant soil health drivers and pressures<sup>[9]</sup>. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating;</li><li>establish, for each living lab, a baseline of the soil conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitor improvements on soil health and associated ecosystem services. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis; proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to the addressed soil health challenge(s), pedoclimatic conditions, land use, and other local/regional factors;</li><li>assess and demonstrate the technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>identify high performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later. Engage with <a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a> to assess the growth and development of these lighthouses and to support the establishment of a labelling process that could formally recognize these exemplary sites as lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution of social sciences and humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer and socio-cultural and behavioural change.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls, or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with <a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">SOILL</a>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities and regular monitoring activities<u> </u>on living labs performance. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives and engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities. Proposals are also encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures (<a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">ESFRI</a>) and to cooperate with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on <a href=\"https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/\">Agroecology</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.foodpaths.eu/sfs-partnership/\">Sustainable Food Systems</a> and/or relevant networks active at local level, such as the EIP-AGRI operational groups to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>Grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but also to at least one project focusing on the Continental biogeographical region and to one project focusing on one or more of the three biogeographical regions (Black Sea, Pannonian and Steppic), provided that proposals attain all thresholds.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">Mission implementation plan</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In particular SDG 3- Good health and well-being, and SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-publications-tools-and-data/publications/all-publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">Implementation Plans for the EU Missions - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/soill-catalogue-2024-mission-soil-living-labs-and-lighthouses\">Catalogue 2024 - Mission Soil Living Labs and Lighthouses| Mission Soil Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <sup> </sup>In this topic, it is recommended to define the living labs location using the NUTS2 division (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/statistical-atlas/viewer/?config=RYB-2024.json&amp;mids=BKGCNT,NUTS2,CNTOVL&amp;o=1,1,0.7&amp;ch=C01,C02,C03,C04,C05,C06,C07,C08,C09,C10,C11,C12&amp;center=43.5714,28.35678,4&amp;lcis=NUTS2&amp;\">Eurostat Statistical Atlas</a> ; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2003/1059/oj/eng\">Regulation - 1059/2003 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] <sup> </sup>By urban green areas, we refer to green spaces in cities such as parks, gardens, green roofs or walls, green corridors, squares, recreational areas, etc.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/maps-and-charts/biogeographical-regions-in-europe-2\">Biogeographical regions in Europe</a> according to the European Environmental Agency</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] <sup> </sup>Mission Soil specific objectives: reduce land degradation relating to desertification; conserve and increase soil organic carbon stocks, no net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils; reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration; prevent erosion; improve soil structure to enhance habitat quality for soil biota and crops; reduce the EU global footprint on soils; increase soil literacy in society.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/10693699\">Soil Needs and Drivers of Change Across Europe and Land Use Types - Booklet</a> from PREPSOIL project</p>"

Eutrophication leads to algal blooms, hypoxia, and biodiversity loss, which in turn disrupt the entire food chains threatening both food availability and safety, as well as other ecosystems functions and the services they provide (e.g. drinking water, recreation). Soil management practices, particularly in agricultural soils, can lead to an excessive accumulation of nutrients in soils, predominantly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and runoff or leaching into water bodies. Thus, soil management represents an important strategy to mitigate eutrophication<sup>[3]</sup>. Moreover, degraded soils with low water retention and limited nutrient cycling capacity, exacerbate eutrophication. Therefore, the restoration of soil health offers a critical opportunity for nutrient interception and reduction of downstream aquatic impacts.</p><p>The Mission Soil proposes the deployment of living labs as a novel approach to research and innovation in soil health<sup>[4]</sup>. Living labs have the potential to facilitate a green transition by involving multiple actors in real-life sites within a local/regional setting to co-create soil health solutions and achieve large-scale impacts on soil health and soil governance. Projects funded under this topic should deploy a number of living labs to expand and complement the network of soil health living labs initiated in previous Mission Soil topics to gradually establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Soil health living labs are long-term collaborations between multiple actors to address common soil health challenges in real-life sites at local or regional level<sup>[6]</sup> (10 to 20 sites in each living lab). Depending on the level at which each living lab operates and the specific context (e.g. land use covered, or soil health challenge addressed), applicants can exceptionally propose living labs with fewer sites. Living labs can address soil health challenges in or across different land uses (agricultural, forest and (semi-)natural). Individual sites can be farms, forest holdings, (semi)natural areas etc., where work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions. In the case of eutrophication, the selection of sites should be conducted to ensure a comprehensive representation of the different drivers that contribute to the eutrophication process in a small river catchment, and where solutions can be co-developed and co-implemented. Sites should be located in nitrate vulnerable zones<sup>[7]</sup> as designated by the EU countries or regional authorities in reporting period 7 (or more recent) or a clear rationale of the eutrophication challenge based on national, regional or local data should justify the location in other areas. Sites that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement and serve as places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication are lighthouses. Lighthouse sites can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab. Projects funded under this topic are expected to kick-start a participatory process or build on existing processes. If building on existing processes, the new proposed living labs should complement the existing network of Mission Soil Living Labs and deliver unique results.</p><p>While on average, projects run for around four years, the duration of the projects under this topic should accommodate longer timescales required to establish participatory processes and/or for soils processes to take place.</p><p>Actors working on common shared soil health challenge(s) within and across the living labs of the same project, will be able to compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, replicate actions and solutions and benefit from cross-fertilisation, thereby accelerating the transition towards the shared objective of improving soil health and reducing eutrophication.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>support the establishment of four to five living labs to work together on soil health aspects that could affect eutrophication in nearby freshwater bodies. The living labs must be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries and each living lab should focus on a specific small river catchment, clearly identifying up- and downstream eutrophication challenges. Proposals should explain the rationale and mechanism for cooperation within and across the living labs while explaining how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission’s specific objectives<sup>[8]</sup>;</li><li>establish an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-actor approach in the living labs to co-design, co-develop, and co-implement locally adapted solutions (practices, tools, and strategies) to reduce eutrophication. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts within the river catchment area in which the living labs are operating and take into account the current and future impact of climate change on nutrient exports during floods and droughts;</li><li>establish for each living lab a baseline of the soil and nearby water body conditions to allow for an accurate co-assessment of the changes in the different sites over time. Monitoring improvements in soil health, ecosystem and associated services, and reductions in eutrophication level. The set of soil health indicators/descriptors presented in the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a> should be used as a basis; proposals may complement with additional indicators tailored to eutrophication as well as to the specific pedoclimatic conditions, land use, and other local/regional factors;</li><li>assess and demonstrate the technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental viability of the proposed solutions, as well as their potential scalability and transferability to diverse contexts, including the insights of SSHA;</li><li>identify high-performing sites that may be converted into lighthouses, either at proposal stage or later during project implementation. Engage with the SOILL<sup>[9]</sup> to assess the growth and development of these lighthouses and to support the establishment of a labelling process that could formally recognize these exemplary sites as lighthouses;</li><li>propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the established living labs beyond Horizon Europe funding. Strategies should include the identification of possible business models and actions involving a mix of public or private funding schemes, financial instruments, cooperation with local authorities, engagement of social economy entities, social enterprises, business communities, SMEs, as well as attracting investors and entrepreneurs.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, projects must adopt the multi-actor approach. The actors involved in each living lab may vary, based on its unique characteristics and may include, among others, researchers, landowners or land managers, industry representatives (e.g., SMEs), public administrators and civil society representatives (e.g., consumers, local residents, environmental NGOs, youth organisations). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities, roles and resources of the different actors involved in the living labs. An effective contribution of social sciences and humanities and the arts (SSHA) is expected to foster social innovation, knowledge transfer, socio-cultural and behavioural change, considering the legal/institutional/political framework at local, regional and national level, if relevant.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors, and recipients of financial support to third parties. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. land managers and landowners such as farmers, SMEs or civil society) in the living labs of a project, can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. The type of activities that could be funded are for example, those related to site management or implementation or monitoring of soil health solutions including hourly rates for collection of data, sampling or participating in events, knowledge exchange, capacity building or demonstration and awareness initiatives equipment; equipment; and/or compensation for loss of production. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Dedicated tasks and appropriate resources should be envisaged to collaborate with SOILL <sup>[10]</sup>, the structure created to support soil health living labs and lighthouses with a wide range of actions that include dedicated capacity building, knowledge exchange, promotion, dissemination, networking opportunities and regular monitoring activities<u> </u>on living labs performance. The details of the collaboration will be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Proposals are expected to build on existing knowledge (e.g. data from national soil health monitoring, LUCAS) and solutions developed and tested at national scale or in the frame of other Horizon projects including those funded under the Mission Soil. Proposals should therefore include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives and engage in relevant Mission Soil clustering activities. Proposals are also encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures (<a href=\"https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu/\">ESFRI</a>) and to cooperate with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on <a href=\"https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/\">Agroecology</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.foodpaths.eu/sfs-partnership/\">Sustainable Food Systems</a> and/or relevant networks active at local level, such as the EIP-AGRI operational groups to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">Mission implementation plan</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] In particular SDG 3- Good health and well-being, and SDG 15 – Life on Land</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2019.03.0131\">A Global Perspective on Integrated Strategies to Manage Soil Phosphorus Status for Eutrophication Control without Limiting Land Productivity - Withers - 2019 - Journal of Environmental Quality - Wiley Online Library</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-publications-tools-and-data/publications/all-publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">Implementation Plans for the EU Missions - European Commission</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/soill-catalogue-2024-mission-soil-living-labs-and-lighthouses\">Catalogue 2024 - Mission Soil Living Labs and Lighthouses| Mission Soil Platform</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] In this topic, it is recommended to define the living labs location using the NUTS2 division (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/statistical-atlas/viewer/?config=RYB-2024.json&amp;mids=BKGCNT,NUTS2,CNTOVL&amp;o=1,1,0.7&amp;ch=C01,C02,C03,C04,C05,C06,C07,C08,C09,C10,C11,C12&amp;center=43.5714,28.35678,4&amp;lcis=NUTS2&amp;\">Eurostat Statistical Atlas</a> ; <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2003/1059/oj/eng\">Regulation - 1059/2003 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] <a href=\"https://water.jrc.ec.europa.eu/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b33a220c1b284583851e93a245da02ef\">Nitrates Directive - Vulnerable Zones Reporting</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] Mission Soil specific objectives: reduce land degradation relating to desertification; conserve and increase soil organic carbon stocks, no net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils; reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration; prevent erosion; improve soil structure to enhance habitat quality for soil biota and crops; reduce the EU global footprint on soils; increase soil literacy in society.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[9] See <a href=\"http://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">www.soill2030.eu/about-us</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[10] <a href=\"https://www.soill2030.eu/about-us\">About Us | Soill</a></p>"

The restoration of degraded landscapes using agroforestry can increase the resilience of communities to shocks, including drought and food shortages, and help mitigate climate change. Agroecology and agroforestry also improve farm profitability for farmers, combining economic benefits with environmental sustainability, in line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food.</p><p>However, its adoption in the EU remains limited largely due to farmers' lack of expertise and financial concerns. Initial costs for establishing agroforestry systems can be high, and financial returns may take longer to realize compared to traditional agricultural practices. Existing business models and traditional farm financing is often not tailored to long-term, diversified systems.</p><p>A landscape approach can significantly aid in overcoming the barriers to agroforestry adoption in the EU and Associated Countries by promoting integrated and sustainable land management practices across larger areas.</p><p>Proposals should focus on landscape-scale implementation of agroforestry practices aiming at scaling up sustainable soil management practices in agroforestry systems across entire value chains and territorial contexts. Proposals should apply participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches, involving actors along the value chain, thereby maximizing ecological and socio-economic impact.</p><p>While normally projects run for four years, the duration of the projects should accommodate longer timescales required by agroforestry and for soils processes to take place.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>using an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong>, <strong>participatory and multi-actor approach, </strong>co-design, co-develop, and pilot locally adapted agroforestry farming systems with a landscape approach that demonstrate an enhancement in soil health in a variety of relevant pedo-climatic areas across the EU and Associated Countries;</li><li><strong>assess and monitor the impacts of agroforestry practices on soil health</strong>. For this, establish a baseline of the soil conditions in the areas where the project will be operating to allow for an accurate monitoring of changes in soil health over time and after the project ends under different agroforestry management practices. Activities should allow for a comparison of the impacts of conventional and organic farming;</li><li>assess and demonstrate the technical, social, economic, cultural and environmental <strong>viability</strong> of the proposed agroforestry systems, as well as their potential <strong>scalability</strong> and transferability to diverse contexts;</li><li>involve public and private actors to mobilise finance, including blended, and develop and test long-term, sustainable <strong>business models</strong>, that facilitate the transition to scalable agroforestry systems;</li><li>produce <strong>recommendations on how policy and the macro-economic framework</strong> could support practically feasible implementation pathways and value chain networks for large scale agroforestry deployment;</li><li><strong>provide capacity building and training opportunities for all actors along the value chain—including farmers, advisors, businesses, consumers and policymakers—focused on practical skills and awareness of soil health improvement, efficient agroforestry management, supportive business models, and incentives to accelerate the transition</strong>.</li> </ul><p>Proposals must implement the <strong>multi-actor approach</strong> to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together. The actors involved should include farmers, forest users, researchers, landowners or land managers – both from the farm and forestry sectors, industry (e.g., SMEs), public administrations (both in charge of farming and of forestry matters), representatives of civil society (e.g., consumers, environmental NGOs).</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of small actors, applicants may use financial support to third parties (FSTP), that can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Proposals should fill R&amp;I gaps, demonstrating value added and complementarity with past/ongoing EU-funded R&amp;I projects, including Mission Soil living labs. Proposals must include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to coordinate with relevant ongoing and upcoming projects funded by the Horizon Europe Partnership <a href=\"https://www.agroecologypartnership.eu/\">Agroecology</a>. Proposals must include coordination and cooperation mechanisms and activities, with the aim of exploiting synergies and complementarities that result in greater impact on soil health and accelerated adoption of agroforestry in the EU and Associated Countries.</p><p><strong>Capitalize, where appropriate, on the existence of relevant living labs set up under other EU-funded actions such as the Agroecology Partnership, to scale up practices beyond the farm to the landscape level. </strong>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards <strong>open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs </strong>through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">European Union Soil Observatory</a> (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"https://soilwise-he.eu/\">SoilWise</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).</p><p>This topic should involve the effective contribution of <strong>social</strong> <strong>sciences and humanities disciplines.</strong></p><p><strong>This action supports the follow-up to the July 2023 </strong><a href=\"https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/resource-library/communication-commission-eu-missions-two-years-assessment-progress-and-way-forward\">Communication on EU Missions assessment</a><u>.</u></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://forest.eea.europa.eu/topics/society/agroforestry\">Agroforestry | Forest Information System of Europe</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/8cd17c6f-051b-4105-866b-dcd344d4ba78/content\">Agroforestry for landscape restoration</a></p>"

Addressing these issues is essential to ensure food security and sustainable land use. The integration of biotechnology can play a transformative role in this regard in the varied environmental conditions and land-use types found across Europe. In addition biotechnology solutions that improve soil health (such as novel bio-based fertilizers or microbial inoculants) can significantly enhance crop productivity by restoring essential nutrients and microbial balance in the soil. Finally, biotechnology solutions can provide innovative methods to decontaminate and rehabilitate degraded soils and lands, thus boosting the ecological and economic value of underutilized areas.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>develop, identify, upscale, pilot and validate biotechnology solutions, particularly leveraging the soil microbiome (such as novel bio-based fertilizers or microbial inoculants but not only) which remediate, restore and improve soil health across diverse pedoclimatic and cropping conditions;</li><li>address the following issues: bioremediation of contaminated soils (i.e. by heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, PFAS); increasing soil organic carbon stocks, improving soil structure to enhance soil biodiversity, water retention and nutrient availability; overall, this should lead to enhanced crop quality and productivity, enabled higher and more sustainable biomass production;</li><li>ensure that developed solutions are scalable, sustainable, cost-effective and integrate circular economy principles to boost resource efficiency and support sustainable soil management practices;</li><li>assess the economic, environmental and social impact of developed biotechnological solutions; analyse their socio-economic feasibility (including cost-benefit, adoption barriers, and market potential) and validate their scalability and market readiness through stakeholder collaboration (e.g. SMEs, farmers, industry); address challenges related to environmental stability and sustainability of the developed solutions and the adaptability to varying environmental conditions;</li><li>design integrated market-readiness pathways for the developed biotechnology solutions, to accelerate their safe, effective, and socially accepted deployment. The pathways should ensure regulatory compliance including risk assessment considerations, stakeholder engagement strategies, market acceptance analysis and policy foresight.</li> </ul><p>Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of all relevant actors of the value chain, such as academia, research-technology organizations, small-medium enterprises (including start-ups), investors, product developers, intellectual property and legal advisors, manufacturing and distribution partners, as well as end-users, like farmers and practitioners.</p><p>Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other project funded under this topic and other relevant topics. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, as well as organise common communication and dissemination activities and show potential for upscaling and cross-fertilisation. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.</p>"

This caused problems to farmers and landowners, as well as to society in general. However, our knowledge of changes in soil health over the past centuries to millennia is limited, and available datasets span only the past two or three decades. This knowledge gap hinders a thorough understanding of the long-term drivers and consequences of soil degradation, of improved future projections of soil health under different scenarios of climate and land management changes, of the long-term effects of soil management practices, as well as of how human behaviour can change to adopt measures to increase soil health. This is especially relevant in the context of future climate change.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>study past soil degradation processes and their socio-economic, cultural and natural drivers and consequences across different pedo-climatic regions, based on multiple lines of evidence coming from, for instance, historical documents, historical records, archaeological data, sediment archives, buried fossil soils and archived soil and plant samples;</li><li>apply, validate and advance the development of methodologies to study past soil health, using techniques such as ancient eDNA analysis, pollen, spores, environmental radionuclides and other proxy indicators, and implement a multi-scalar approach to integrate these data at the scale of pedo-climatic regions;</li><li>utilise numerical models and digital tools to reconstruct past soil degradation patterns and predict future trends and develop trajectories for sustainable soil management;</li><li>encourage citizen and stakeholder involvement through active participation in the data collection and data analysis with citizen science initiatives, as well as carry out communication and awareness raising activities on the long-term changes of soil health and the societal impact of soil degradation.</li> </ul><p>In carrying out the activities, consortia should work in an interdisciplinary way bringing disciplines, expertise and approaches from the soil sciences, environmental sciences and social sciences and humanities (including history, archaeology, sociology and social geography).</p><p>Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China under the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biosolutions (FAB) flagship initiative. Development of specific technologies above TRL 4 is out of the scope of this topic.</p><p>Proposals are expected to collaborate with and build on the results of the projects funded under HORIZON-MISS-2025-05-SOIL-02: Social, economic and cultural drivers, and costs of land degradation. Proposals should also demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso\">EU Soil Observatory</a> and the <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112838\">SoilWise</a> project.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>In particular SDG 13 – Climate action, and SDG 15 – Life on Land.</p>"
