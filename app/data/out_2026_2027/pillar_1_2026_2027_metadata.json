Open Science: </h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Under Horizon Europe, all beneficiaries (including those of ERC grants) must ensure immediate open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. Open access must be provided with full re-use rights. Beneficiaries must ensure that they or the authors retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with their open access requirements. Publishing costs can be considered as eligible costs provided that the publishing venue (e.g., journal, book) is fully open access.</p><p>In addition, beneficiaries of ERC grants funded under this Work Programme will be covered by the provisions on research data management as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. In particular, whenever a project generates research data, beneficiaries are required to manage it in line with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability as described by the ‘FAIR principles’ initiative, and establish a data management plan within the first six months of project implementation. Open access to research data should be ensured under the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. These provisions are designed to facilitate access, re-use and preservation of the research data generated during the ERC-funded research work.</p></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><h4>Specific conditions</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/information-for-applicants_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information for Applicants to the Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/experts/guide-for-peer-reviewers_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guide for Peer Reviewers - Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/erc-rules-for-submission-and-evaluation_he-erc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Rules of Submission and Evaluation under Horizon Europe</a></p></div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-erc-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE ERC COG)</a></p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a> </p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ:L_202402509\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Grants AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Online Manual</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/ftp/tc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/legalnotice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Privacy Statement</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a></p></div></div>"

Open Science:</h4><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p>Under Horizon Europe, all beneficiaries (including those of ERC grants) must ensure immediate open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. Open access must be provided with full re-use rights. Beneficiaries must ensure that they or the authors retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with their open access requirements. Publishing costs can be considered as eligible costs provided that the publishing venue (e.g., journal, book) is fully open access.</p><p>In addition, beneficiaries of ERC grants funded under this Work Programme will be covered by the provisions on research data management as set out in the Model Grant Agreement used for ERC actions. In particular, whenever a project generates research data, beneficiaries are required to manage it in line with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability as described by the ‘FAIR principles’ initiative, and establish a data management plan within the first six months of project implementation. Open access to research data should be ensured under the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. These provisions are designed to facilitate access, re-use and preservation of the research data generated during the ERC-funded research work.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\">\n</div><div class=\"eui-u-mt-l\"><div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2026/wp_horizon-erc-2026_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Work Programme 2026</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/information-for-applicants_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Information for Applicants to the Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/experts/guide-for-peer-reviewers_he-erc-stg-cog_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guide for Peer Reviewers - Starting and Consolidator Grant Calls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/erc-rules-for-submission-and-evaluation_he-erc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ERC Rules of Submission and Evaluation under Horizon Europe</a></p></div><h4>Application and evaluation forms and model grant agreement (MGA):</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><strong>Application form templates</strong> <em>— the application form specific to this call is available in the Submission System</em></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/af/af_he-erc-stg_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Standard application form (HE ERC STG)</a></p><p><strong>Model Grant Agreements (MGA)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/agr-contr/general-mga_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HE MGA</a></p></div><h4>Additional documents:</h4> <div class=\"eui-u-mt-s\"><p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ:L_202402509\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EU Grants AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Online Manual</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/ftp/tc_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions</a>&#xa0;</p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/legalnotice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Privacy Statement</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/list-3rd-country-participation_horizon-euratom_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe</a></p></div></div>"

An overview is provided below:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation procedure</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A single submission of the full proposal will be followed by a three-step evaluation, including interviews of all the Principal Investigators. The evaluation will be conducted by means of a structure of dedicated panels. The panels may be assisted by independent external experts working remotely.&#xa0;The composition of the panels at each step is not predefined but will be decided dynamically in relation to the proposals received.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The applicant Corresponding Principal Investigator can request on behalf of the group&#xa0;during the electronic proposal submission that up to four specific persons should not act as an evaluator in the evaluation of their proposal.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 1</u>: One panel is formed with approximately 90 panel members, including 5 chairs, who will assess&#xa0;the extended synopsis&#xa0;of the scientific proposal (only Part I - and not the full scientific proposal) and the Principal Investigators’ CVs and track records.&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 2 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 1 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to seven times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 2</u>: Panel members from step 1 will be divided in panels of comparable sizes. They will assess&#xa0;the complete version of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II).&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 3 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 2 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to three times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 3</u>:&#xa0;The interview panels (that may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals) will&#xa0;assess&#xa0;the complete version of the most competitive of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II) and&#xa0;all their Principal Investigators may be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For all ERC frontier research grants,&#xa0;<strong>scientific excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation</strong>.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The aim is to provide support for a small group of <strong>two to four Principal Investigators to jointly address</strong> <strong>ambitious research problems that could not be addressed by the individual Principal Investigators and their teams working alone</strong>. Synergy projects should enable substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, stemming, for example, from the cross-fertilization of scientific fields, from new productive lines of enquiry, or new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. The transformative research funded by Synergy Grants should have the potential of becoming a benchmark on a global scale.</p><p>Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal. Principal Investigators must also demonstrate that their group can successfully bring together the scientific elements necessary to address the scope and complexity of the proposed research question.</p><p>One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator. At any one time, one Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant Group except the Corresponding one can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.</p><p><strong><em>Size of ERC Synergy Grants</em></strong></p><p>Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of <strong>EUR 10 000 000</strong> for a period of <strong>6 years</strong>. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.</p><p>Additional funding up to <strong>EUR 4 000 000 * </strong>can be requested to cover further eligible costs (e.g. start-up costs, major equipment, access to large facilities, major experimental and field work costs) when these are necessary to carry out the proposed work. The requests for additional funding must be duly justified in the proposal.</p><p><strong><em>Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators</em></strong></p><p>The 'Synergy Grant Group' applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators with competitive track records and, as necessary, their teams.</p><p>Each of the Principal Investigators must present in the proposal a Curriculum Vitae and a Track Record as appropriate to their career stage.</p><p>For further information, please see the ERC Work Programme 2026.</p>"

An overview is provided below:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation procedure</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A single submission of the full proposal will be followed by a three-step evaluation, including interviews of all the Principal Investigators. The evaluation will be conducted by means of a structure of dedicated panels. The panels may be assisted by independent external experts working remotely.&#xa0;The composition of the panels at each step is not predefined but will be decided dynamically in relation to the proposals received.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The applicant Corresponding Principal Investigator can request on behalf of the group&#xa0;during the electronic proposal submission that up to four specific persons should not act as an evaluator in the evaluation of their proposal.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 1</u>: One panel is formed with approximately 90 panel members, including 5 chairs, who will assess&#xa0;the extended synopsis&#xa0;of the scientific proposal (only Part I - and not the full scientific proposal) and the Principal Investigators’ CVs and track records.&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 2 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 1 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to seven times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 2</u>: Panel members from step 1 will be divided in panels of comparable sizes. They will assess&#xa0;the complete version of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II).&#xa0;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Proposals will be retained for step 3 based on the outcome of the evaluation at step 2 and a budgetary cut-off level of up to three times the panel's indicative budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><u>At step 3</u>:&#xa0;The interview panels (that may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals) will&#xa0;assess&#xa0;the complete version of the most competitive of the retained proposals (Parts I and&#xa0;II) and&#xa0;all their Principal Investigators may be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For all ERC frontier research grants,&#xa0;<strong>scientific excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation</strong>. The panels will primarily evaluate:</p><ul><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the ground-breaking nature and ambition&#xa0;of the research project.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the same time, the panels will evaluate:</p><ol><li data-list=\"bullet\" class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>the intellectual capacity, creativity, and commitment of the Principal Investigators, with a focus on the extent to which the Principal Investigators have the required scientific expertise and capacity to successfully execute the project.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The peer reviewers will need to see that the collaborative working arrangements between the Principal Investigators described as part of the research methodology, can ensure scientific excellence.

Synergy projects should enable substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, stemming, for example, from the cross-fertilization of scientific fields, from new productive lines of enquiry, or new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. The transformative research funded by Synergy Grants should have the potential of becoming a benchmark on a global scale.</p><p>Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal. Principal Investigators must also demonstrate that their group can successfully bring together the scientific elements necessary to address the scope and complexity of the proposed research question.</p><p>One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator. At any one time, one Principal Investigator per Synergy Grant Group except the Corresponding one can be hosted or engaged by an institution outside of the EU or Associated Countries.</p><p><strong><em>Size of ERC Synergy Grants</em></strong></p><p>Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of <strong>EUR 10 000 000</strong> for a period of <strong>6 years</strong>. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.</p><p>Additional funding up to <strong>EUR 4 000 000 * </strong>can be requested to cover further eligible costs (e.g. start-up costs, major equipment, access to large facilities, major experimental and field work costs) when these are necessary to carry out the proposed work. The requests for additional funding must be duly justified in the proposal.</p><p><strong><em>Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators</em></strong></p><p>The 'Synergy Grant Group' applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators with competitive track records and, as necessary, their teams.</p><p>Each of the Principal Investigators must present in the proposal a Curriculum Vitae and a Track Record as appropriate to their career stage.</p><p>For further information, please see the ERC Work Programme 2026.</p>"

The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. Given that the financial support to third parties is one of the primary aims of the action and taking into account the nature of the work to be supported and the cross-RI, cross-domain nature of the intended open science projects and services, the maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 750 000. The selection of the third parties to be supported will be based on an external independent peer review of their proposed work.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased adoption of open science and research data management practices in line with the FAIR principles by researchers and across research infrastructures (RIs) in Europe.</li><li>Increased uptake of the EOSC Federation by researchers through the long-term sustainable provision in the Federation of scientific services and high-quality, FAIR research data, and their integration in scientific workflows addressing current gaps and needs of research communities.</li><li>Research communities, as well as ESFRI and other European research infrastructures increase their alignment with EOSC standards and policies, and their capacity to integrate in the EOSC Federation.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims to further increase across Europe the adoption of open science and research data management practices in line with the FAIR principles, and to support the development of a user-focused and science-driven EOSC Federation.</p><p>It capitalises on the previous work by Science Clusters in enabling open science practices, FAIR implementation and managing open calls for multi-disciplinary science projects. It also builds on the experience by several RIs and other organisations as active participants in building the EOSC Federation, either through the establishment of EOSC nodes or the onboarding of resources to EOSC nodes<sup>[1]</sup>, to support the engagement of underrepresented RIs and research communities into the EOSC ecosystem.</p><p>Proposals should cover both the following activities:</p><p>1) Accelerate FAIR adoption and the contribution to and use of EOSC resources by multiple research communities through open science projects.</p><p>This activity should be implemented through open calls that provide grants to third parties for open science projects through a cascading grant mechanism. The open calls should encourage, where applicable, cross-RI and/or cross-domain collaborations, including for data access, use and reuse.</p><p>Open science projects should address questions of high scientific impact, adopting best practices for FAIR data and service management and demonstrating their benefits. Their activities may include developing, annotating, curating and making FAIR high-value datasets, developing direct pipelines to integrate large-scale experimental data in repositories federated in EOSC, operationalising data access for AI-based applications, reusing existing datasets, enhancing existing and developing new vocabularies, data standards, metadata mappings and crosswalks, developing software, tools and services, or supporting open science community building.</p><p>They should cover a broad range of (academic and/or industrial) research communities and scientific disciplines, including those less represented in the EOSC Federation. They should make use of resources available in the EOSC Federation and adopt existing EOSC policies and standards<sup>[2]</sup>, where possible. Projects should strive to ensure the sustained, beyond the projects’ duration, integration, deployment and operation of relevant outcomes in the EOSC Federation.</p><p>At least EUR 29 million of the EU contribution to this topic should be used in this activity<sup>[3]</sup>. The financial support to third parties for the open science projects must be provided in the form of grants that should be between EUR 100 000 and 250 000 per grant for a duration of 12 to 24 months. The consortium shall put in place adequate measures to support the integration of the open science projects’ results into the EOSC Federation. These could include mentoring, training and any other activities providing effective linkage to the EOSC Federation and EOSC Nodes, as needed for the specific nature of each project.</p><p>2) Support the integration of thematic research and RI communities in the EOSC Federation</p><p>The following activities should be included:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Coordinating, aligning and networking existing community-based competence centres on FAIR and open science practices developed within the EOSC ecosystem.</li><li>Developing training programmes, modules and material on FAIR and open science practices tailored to the specific needs of different thematic research communities. This activity should include feedback mechanisms to ensure that the training services are responsive to the evolving needs of EOSC user communities.</li><li>Developing frameworks for the provision and continuous evolution of high-impact services and data repositories onboarded to the EOSC Federation, fostering interoperability and integration of data and resources from diverse scientific domains and promoting their sharing through the EOSC Federation.</li><li>Establishing mechanisms for the integration and long-term sustainable provision of all relevant outcomes into the EOSC Federation, as well as for continuous feedback and adaptation, ensuring evolving requirements of researchers and RIs are met within the EOSC ecosystem.</li><li>Engaging underrepresented thematic research and RI communities to increase their integration in EOSC.</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects, including actions awarded under topics HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-EOSC-01, HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-EOSC-02 and HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-EOSC-01. This may include the upgrade, deployment and adoption where appropriate of existing community-endorsed pilot, tools, services and standards developed by past and ongoing INFRAEOSC projects. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for the European Open Science Cloud<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] Relevant information and documentation about the EOSC Federation can be found in the EOSC Federation Handbook and other relevant documentation adopted by the EOSC Federation.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] As described in the EOSC Federation Handbook and other relevant documentation potentially adopted by the EOSC Federation.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] Including reasonable administrative and management costs related to the open calls for the financial support to third parties.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] https://eosc.eu/partnership/</p>"

The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is the primary activity of the action in order to be able to achieve its objectives. Given the type of action and its level of ambition, as well as that access to certain types of digital services can be costly and that activities other than access will also be supported, the maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 2.00 million.</p><p>The funding rate is 50% of the eligible costs. This is justified as the provision of digital services to users of the EOSC Federation and the broadening and integration of research communities in the EOSC Federation are activities with strong European added value that are typically not supported by national funding bodies.</p><p>At least 20% of the total financial support to third parties must be open to entities eligible for funding as described in the General Annex B, therefore it must not have any additional geographic restrictions for eligibility for funding.</p><p>Beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional access rights:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Each beneficiary must grant royalty-free access to its results to the EOSC Association for monitoring and developing policies and strategies for the European Open Science Cloud. Each beneficiary must also provide directly to the EOSC Association the information the beneficiary deems necessary for monitoring and developing policies and strategies for the EOSC.</li><li>Each beneficiary must grant royalty-free access to its intellectual property rights which are part of the results and are needed for further developing the EOSC to legal entities identified by the granting authority and established in Member States or countries associated to the Horizon Europe Framework Programme.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The EOSC Federation provides to EOSC users with state-of-the-art digital services addressing their needs to store, process and share data, run software, models and workflows, and collaborate with their peers.</li><li>Research and digital infrastructures and other organisations providing scientific services are equipped with appropriate structures and technical, legal and coordination mechanisms to onboard, manage and sustainably operate digital tools and services in the EOSC Federation.</li><li>Investments across Europe in the provision of FAIR scientific data and services within EOSC are more aligned and coordinated, achieving economies of scale and more efficient use of digital resources.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>In order to carry out typical research workflows, researchers need to use a broad range of digital services such as data storage, computing, applications, and collaboration tools. Such services are often cost-intensive and their provision is restricted, e.g. to researchers within a country/region or a specific thematic area. The EOSC Federation aims to provide a trusted, sovereign and secure environment to researchers in Europe to use high-quality, FAIR research data and run research workflows, with a focus on cross-disciplinary and cross-country research collaboration.</p><p>The aim of the topic is to set up an EOSC Federation-wide mechanism that enables multiple organisations to seamlessly offer such digital services, and to support the sustained provision of these services to EOSC users. It also aims to enlarge the EOSC Federation by supporting the expansion of Nodes as gateways through which multiple organisations can offer their resources, such as data and services, to EOSC users.</p><p>Proposals should cover the following activities:</p><p>1) Provide seamless, user-friendly access to EOSC users to digital services for typical research workflows such as data storage, computing, applications, and collaboration tools, through a fully integrated EOSC Federation-wide system.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Gather requirements and analyse needs of researchers and EOSC users for such services and how they can best complement and integrate with existing resources in the EOSC Federation.</li><li>Support developing and embedding a Federation-wide resource management and accounting system for the efficient provision of such services across the Federation, building on the design principles of the ‘virtual credit allocation’ system of the EOSC EU Node and any further development in the EOSC Federation.</li><li>Provide access to EOSC users to such services, based on the researchers' and EOSC users' needs and requirements and making use of a Federation-wide resource management and accounting system and harmonised access policies, in line with the principles and guidelines of transnational and virtual access to European Research Infrastructures and related EOSC Federation policies.</li><li>Upgrade the EOSC user experience through deep, back-end, cross-provider integration of key digital services covering the full research lifecycle, achieving a user-friendly and robust environment.</li><li>Develop, test and demonstrate business models for the effective management of the supply and demand of such services, as well as for their long-term sustainable provision in the EOSC Federation, beyond the end of the project’s duration.</li><li>Develop guidelines to facilitate a harmonised approach to the acquisition and provision of such services that supports research data sovereignty and research security in Europe, ensuring a trusted, secure and sovereign EOSC Federation.</li><li>Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback and improvement, including indicators for monitoring the quality and usage of the services, building on and further developing existing mechanisms of the EOSC Federation, and ensuring that the evolving needs and requirements of EOSC users are met by the EOSC Federation.</li> </ul><p>These activities should be fully concerted and aligned with related parallel activities carried out by the EOSC Federation.</p><p>2) Support the broadening, integration and structuring of the participation of research communities in the EOSC Federation through</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the development and establishment of intra-Node coordination mechanisms and organisational models to enable EOSC Nodes to effectively represent broad communities and multiple organisations in the EOSC Federation,</li><li>the development and use of digital capabilities, and of options for harmonised legal arrangements, such as contractual or service-level agreements, for onboarding and sustainably provisioning communities’ services through EOSC Nodes,</li><li>broadening organisations’ engagement with and contribution to the EOSC Federation, including underrepresented thematic research communities or geographic areas.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should implement the activities through the organisation of joint calls that provide grants to third parties.</p><p>The joint calls should be open to organisations that participate or are interested to participate in the EOSC Federation either by operating an EOSC Node or by onboarding their identified resources to the EOSC Federation, in line with the relevant criteria set by the EOSC Federation.</p><p>Proposed activities should be driven by current gaps and needs of scientific communities, digital infrastructures and service providers. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how they will contribute to addressing these needs and increasing the uptake of the EOSC Federation by researchers.</p><p>The activities should comply with and contribute to the continuous update and upgrade of related EOSC Federation policies and standards, including technical and interoperability standards, the use of open standards, harmonised access and use policies, and cybersecurity<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should include a robust and credible plan for the long-term, beyond the project’s duration, sustained operation of the services that they will make available in the EOSC Federation, and any other relevant project results.</p><p>For what concerns provision of access to digital services by third parties funded under the joint calls, proposals should include a list of the digital services that will be supported through the joint calls. The third parties funded under the joint calls should identify the specific digital services that they will provide for access and the amount of access made available to EOSC users, allocating budget according to users’ demand and making use of the Federation-wide resource management and accounting system. These third parties should also fulfil further conditions and requirements described in the ‘Virtual Access Activities’ part of the ‘Specific Features for Research Infrastructures’ section of this Work Programme, for what concerns publicity of the access offered, determining the access costs, and setting criteria for access by EOSC users in line with the EOSC Federation access policies. Proposals are expected to address compliance with these specific conditions and notably ensure that the selected third parties will provide appropriate documentation to support and justify the amount of access provided and corresponding costs.</p><p>Projects are encouraged to explore synergies with relevant EU initiatives such as EuroHPC. To ensure coherence and complementarity of outcomes, funded projects are expected to cooperate with each other and with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of the EOSC Federation including actions awarded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2023-01-EOSC-04, HORIZON-INFRA-2024-EOSC-02-01, HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-EOSC-01, HORIZON-INFRA-2026-01-EOSC-01 and closely interact with the organisational setup of the EOSC Federation. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for the European Open Science Cloud<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] As described in the EOSC Federation Handbook and other relevant documentation potentially adopted by the EOSC Federation.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] https://eosc.eu/partnership/</p>"

Effective and transparent community-driven data sovereignty frameworks are important enablers of open science, in particular ensuring safe and trusted management of personal or sensitive data, safeguarding the quality of curated research datasets and the effective application of related EU and national digital and data legislation. Data sovereignty mechanisms can also improve the resilience and preparedness of research and data infrastructures against risks related to access to and preservation of critical data and services, including risks related to data generated and stored outside the EU/EEA.</p><p>The exponential growth of available research data and the increasingly collaborative and cross-disciplinary research has accentuated challenges related to secure, efficient and lawful cross-border data sharing for research purposes. Removing barriers to data sharing while ensuring data sovereignty is crucial to realise the potential of EOSC to foster trusted cross-country and cross-discipline scientific collaboration.</p><p>This topic aims to support data sovereignty while enabling seamless and trusted data sharing and access across scientific disciplines, EU Member States and third countries where the EU considers sufficient data protection is in place, tackling different regulatory regimes and procedures. </p><p>Proposals should include the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development and implementation of national, community and/or institutional research data sovereignty frameworks, including policies for data sharing and access, harmonised and aligned with EU digital and data legislation and international agreements such as adequacy decisions and digital partnership agreements, as well as best practices from EOSC, related common European data spaces and international data-sharing standards and initiatives.</li><li>Demonstration and validation of concrete adoption cases of data sovereignty policies by national, community or institutional actors, aligned with open science and the FAIR data principles.</li><li>Development of harmonised governance frameworks, ensuring smooth enforcement of data sovereignty policies.</li><li>Development of comprehensive data provenance tools to trace and verify the quality and lineage of data used in research, and demonstration through identified use cases within relevant selected thematic areas.</li><li>Development of templates and guidelines for secure and sovereign data management, including template agreements on data sharing, publication, and reuse, and guidelines for licensing.</li><li>Development of guidelines for classifying critical data and services based on sensitivity and relevance to scientific communities and European policies, and for managing risks related to access to and preservation of such critical data and services.</li><li>Analysis of data categories and definitions across scientific disciplines, incorporating compliance with security requirements set out in EU and national legislation.</li><li>Development of recommendations for the establishment of a support centre, linking with relevant national and thematic competence centres, focused on compliance of data management with EU and national legislation, and proof of concept of its integration and sustainable operation in the EOSC Federation. </li> </ul><p>Projects are encouraged to explore synergies with relevant EU initiatives such as other common European data spaces that address sensitive data or data critical for research. To ensure complementarity and use of latest research results, proposals should build on ongoing and previous INFRAEOSC projects such as those funded by topics 2023-EOSC-01-06, 2023-EOSC-01-04 and 2024-EOSC-01-04 and align with the EOSC Federation policies and standards<sup>[1]</sup>.

It therefore has the potential to facilitate and provide appropriate frameworks for knowledge valorisation, open innovation practices and industry-academia collaboration especially for what concerns results that stem from cross-discipline or cross-country research. Activities funded under this topic should aim to support the capacity of the EOSC Federation and its community to better valorise research results in line with the EU’s code of practice on intellectual assets management<sup>[2]</sup> and standardisation in the European Research Area<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>A key element in this effort is to clarify the legal conditions to valorise knowledge resources, including resources provided in the EOSC Federation. As knowledge resources have various degrees of copyright protection, it is often challenging for researchers to navigate in what they are allowed to do with the knowledge resources and how they can be used in industry-academia collaboration. A better overview of requirements and more legal clarity will therefore incentivise researchers to valorise the knowledge resources of the EOSC Federation.</p><p>This effort should also take into account the specific needs of different research communities contributing to the EOSC Federation, ensuring they have the possibility to set better legal terms for knowledge valorisation through appropriate choice of licenses etc. More guidance is therefore needed to ensure that contributors can share their knowledge resources in the EOSC Federation with fewer legal strings attached.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should include the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analyse opportunities and barriers emerging from the provisions of the EU’s current legal framework on intellectual property and relevant types of licenses that set the legal conditions for researchers to valorise knowledge resources in EOSC Federation.</li><li>Gather requirements and needs, develop and analyse potential business models and access schemes for innovators and start-ups in Europe to access and use resources available in the EOSC Federation.</li><li>Develop a number of case studies of identified EOSC stakeholders valorising their results and/or establishing collaboration links with the private sector.</li><li>Map out and evaluate the possibilities of relevant types of licenses for knowledge resources to facilitate knowledge valorisation and engage in open innovation and industry-academia collaboration.</li><li>Organise workshops, webinars and awareness-raising campaigns, and develop guiding material targeted at EOSC users and communities contributing to EOSC on how to facilitate and engage in knowledge valorisation and industry-academia collaboration based on the knowledge resources of EOSC Federation.</li><li>Develop recommendations and best practices, based also on the case studies, for further development of the EOSC Federation to facilitate knowledge valorisation and industry-academia collaboration. </li> </ul><p>To ensure complementarity with and use of the latest EU guidelines and research results, proposals should build on ongoing and previous Horizon Europe-funded projects, including IP4OS, EU guiding principles for knowledge valorisation, Knowledge Valorisation Platform and code of practice for intellectual property management and standards.

All fields of research can be considered.</p><p>Major upgrades or extensions of existing infrastructures may also be considered if the result is significantly transformative with regards to the scientific outputs or the technical approach of the infrastructure and equivalent to a new infrastructure concept. Proposals considering routine maintenance, incremental gains or just a new component of a research infrastructure are not in scope of this topic<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>When developing a new concept, applicants should assess as a first option extending the scope of already existing infrastructures and/or sustainably integrating existing pan-European and national capacities to address the specific research infrastructure service needs, identifying what is missing and the new developments necessary.<sup>[3]</sup> Otherwise, applicants should explicitly justify why this option cannot be considered.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the uniqueness and added value for the European Research Area (ERA) of the new, upgraded or extended research infrastructure, considering the European landscape of research infrastructures and the ESFRI landscape analysis and, where relevant, the capacity to better tackle scientific and societal challenges, notably in support of strategic research and innovation agendas developed by key EU initiatives including European Partnerships<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals for research infrastructure concept development should tackle all key questions concerning the technical and conceptual feasibility of new, upgraded or extended fully fledged user facilities.</p><p>In this respect, proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>demonstrate relevance in relation to the ERA, including to the existing landscape, and the expected advancement with respect to the state-of-art of the new, upgraded or extended infrastructure;</li><li>highlight the research challenges the new, upgraded or extended research infrastructures will make possible to address, including at global level;</li><li>indicate the gaps in the research infrastructure landscape the new, upgraded or extended infrastructure will cover and the synergies with other existing infrastructures at European and global level, including those co-financed from other EU instruments such as through Cohesion funds;</li><li>indicate, when relevant, the potential impact of the new research infrastructure at regional level.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should also convincingly demonstrate that the project will effectively:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>identify technologies, with due attention to technology sovereignty, and the architecture (e.g. single site or distributed) for developing the research infrastructure;</li><li>identify scientific user communities (and their related needs) that will benefit from access to research infrastructure services, including scientific data and instrumentation, and develop the planning of research services to users;</li><li>identify governance options as well as strategic approaches for institutional/stakeholders’ commitment and engagement, as well as for ensuring a wide membership;</li><li>develop initial financial plans for the implementation and operation of the new, upgraded or extended research infrastructure as well as preliminary ideas for long-term sustainability, including synergies with other funds and programmes (e.g. ERDF for construction);</li><li>develop plans for efficient data curation and preservation and for the provision of access to data collected or produced by the future infrastructure, in line with the FAIR principles.</li> </ul><p>When relevant, ethical dimensions, environmental (including climate-related) impacts as well as the optimisation of resource and energy use should be integrated in the concept development of new, upgraded or extended research infrastructures. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p>Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Flagship Research Infrastructure projects that the JRC is planning to set-up to address new and upcoming priorities of the European Commission in the coming decades. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>A research infrastructure is of European interest when is able to attract users from EU or associated countries other than the country where the infrastructure is located.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Unlike a major upgrade or extension, the research infrastructure complemented by its new component is not equivalent to a new infrastructure concept and is not transformative enough to qualify as the next generation of research infrastructure of European interest</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] This option considers a new concept, which could develop independently and would qualify, alone, as a next generation of research infrastructure of European interest but which, for the sake of sustainability and consolidation of the European landscape of research infrastructures, would benefit from developing by extending or integrating into an existing research infrastructure.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/european-partnerships-horizon-europe_en#what-are-european-partnerships\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/european-partnerships-horizon-europe_en#what-are-european-partnerships</a></p>"

This thematic clustering is aligned with ESFRI approach: <u>proposals should explicitly state which ESFRI domain</u><sup>[1]</sup><u>they address </u>(see specific conditions on procedure for ranking proposals). Proposals should foresee close collaboration across projects under this topic to ensure, where applicable, policy coordination, technical interoperability and other synergies.</p><p>Building on the clusters under Horizon 2020<sup>[2]</sup>and Horizon Europe<sup>[3]</sup>, on the development of catalogues of services, and on new access pathways and improved services such as under Horizon Europe INFRASERV<sup>[4]</sup> projects, proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthening the representation of the research infrastructures cluster, as a single or coordinated voice, in key EU policy developments and strategic initiatives and contribute to policies in their domain with a research infrastructure component. Coordination with cross-domains fora, such as the ERIC Forum and EIROforum should also be ensured.</li><li>Strengthening coordination among research infrastructures to foster complementarities, interoperability, harmonisation, integration and synergies within the domain, and where relevant with other domains to address increasingly complex and multidisciplinary science and technology challenges.</li><li>Developing, optimising and connecting catalogues of research infrastructures services of European interest. Attention is required to new users, notably researchers and innovators from widening countries and candidate countries, industry (including SMEs, startups and scaleups), early-stage career researchers, and non-expert users. Flexibility to address future needs should be considered.</li><li>Developing and implementing intermediary services, user support, tools and notably AI assisted research infrastructure services navigation. When relevant, resulting data and digital services should be made accessible through EOSC.</li><li>Elaborating and promoting indicators flagging the strategic relevance of specific research infrastructures services to key EU R&amp;I priorities and initiatives, including through common or coordinated impact assessments, and possible validation mechanisms with these initiatives.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should involve, not necessarily as beneficiaries, ESFRI Landmarks and Projects and/or ERICs in the domain, other research infrastructures that are international European research organisations and, where relevant, well-established networks of key European research infrastructures open to external users. Proposals should elaborate on which key EU priorities and initiatives (such as Horizon Europe partnerships, missions) they will consider and the nature and objectives of the envisaged coordination mechanisms or joint activities.</p><p>To ensure a holistic view from design to implementation of possible access schemes, proposals should ensure strong and continuous collaboration with the cross-domain preparatory action exploring a more integrated and sustainable scheme for access to research infrastructures HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-DEV-05<sup>[5]</sup>, and the actions supported under topics HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-SERV-01 and HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-SERV-02. This collaboration should ensure a common front page to all above actions highlighting the common objectives of EU supported access, the main conditions and requirements, providing preliminary guidance on access opportunities and directing to the single-entry point portal of each pilot of HORIZON-INFRA-2027-SERV-01-01. The collaboration should also promote simplified access pathways, good practices on call conditions, converging access modalities and selection process, and effective governance of the set of projects acting as an access programme with appropriate advisory bodies.</p><p>Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) research infrastructures in the area of health and food. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] ESFRI domains: 1.

The completion of the training programme should lead to recognised accreditation in ECTS points.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims at the training of staff managing research infrastructures, the adequate supply of skilled human resources, and strengthening and sustaining specific education curricula and courses with due attention to widening and candidate countries as well as to evolving research infrastructure environments.</p><p>The complexity of research infrastructures and the exploitation of their full potential require adequate skills for their managers. Research infrastructures are built and operated at the cutting edge of what is technologically feasible, involving a high associated risk that needs to be managed.</p><p>They may involve a wide consortium of partners for their funding, construction and operation, either because they are distributed research infrastructures, or because certain problems are of a scale that can only be tackled through European and international cooperation.</p><p>This renders their governance and the associated financial and legal issues a complex problem. The skills and expertise specifically needed to effectively construct, manage and use research infrastructures are therefore not widely available.</p><p>Proposals should build on existing curricula such as those developed under the RItrainplus<sup>[1]</sup> project and strengthen and continue professionalising the training offer including through sustained and recognised executive master’s in management of research infrastructures. Proposals should pay attention to the upskilling of research infrastructures managers with regard to the impact of increased digitalisation of research infrastructures, including use of AI, further internationalisation and geopolitical changes, and closer links to industry. Proposals should engage with pan-European research infrastructures such as those prioritised by ESFRI, ERICs and EIROforum, to ensure the proposed training fits the needs of complex research infrastructures.</p><p>The proposed action should include several of the following objectives:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the training of staff managing research infrastructures, and exchanges of staff and best practices. The training may also be offered to students engaged with a research infrastructure or aiming at a research infrastructure career path.</li><li>Develop specific education curricula and courses targeting pan-European research infrastructures, taking into account their diverse scientific fields and organisational models; in doing this, engagement with universities is expected.</li><li>Offer dedicated scholarships to staff in Ukrainian research infrastructures, while promoting and disseminating training opportunities to widening and candidate countries in particular.</li><li>Address training topics such as the socioeconomic impact of research infrastructures, scientific capabilities and capacity, engagement with academic users and industry (including understanding the needs of startups and scaleups), in-depth guidance on State Aid rules, and the long-term financial and environmental sustainability of the infrastructure’s activities.</li><li>Address the areas of data management, exploitation and stewardship skills, FAIR principles and data protection rules.</li><li>Pay attention to training research infrastructure staff in the different governance models for international research infrastructure collaborations, across different scientific fields, taking stock of the rapidly evolving geopolitical context.</li><li>Address training on research security and provide an overview of how research infrastructures need to face these challenges in their operations.</li><li>Report on the sustainability of the training activities, and engage with national agencies, ERICs, international organisations, and other relevant stakeholders.</li><li>Demonstrate an evolution based on related past activities and the experience gained in projects such as RAMIRI (Realising and Managing International Research Infrastructures) and RItrain (Research Infrastructures Training Programme).</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] RItrainPlus - RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TRAINING PLUS <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101008503\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101008503</a></p>"

Exchange best practices on risk-assessment and develop guidance.</li><li>Describe where applicable the expected impact of realised risks beyond the research infrastructures concerned i.e. impact on related operational or deployment programme where relevant, on international agreements, on addressing EU priorities, on EU competitiveness, on EU strategic autonomy; in this context, identify which research infrastructures services could qualify as ‘critical R&amp;I services’.</li><li>Implement mitigation and, where applicable, contingency plans to address capacities at risk, in order to ensure the sustainability of the research infrastructure concerned as well as to preserve EU capacity and research freedom to address its policy, priorities and socio-economic challenges investments across Europe for trusted and secure storage, processing and sharing of critical data including through EOSC.</li><li>Develop guidance and disseminate best practices on risk-assessment and research security, taking into account EU recommendations in the field of research security and foreign interference.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><ul level=\"0\"><li>A state-of-the-art EBRAINS digital infrastructure for brain research, providing data, digital tools and services to the European research communities in neurosciences, brain medicine, and brain-inspired technologies. The platform will be powered by AI and will integrate innovative AI tools to support intuitive interaction with users, facilitate brain research, data analysis, simulations and modelling of the brain, and support FAIR data indexing and archival to scale-up data integration and curation.</li><li>New services and applications for neuroscience, brain health and cognitive technologies, aligned with national and European research priorities. Workflows that connect and integrate large sets of data, services and tools available at EBRAINS will be in the focus in combination with access to large storage and compute resources.</li><li>Innovative brain-inspired AI tools, that are based on insights from brain research, for example, in learning, decision process, plasticity, with application in research, robotics, and neurotech.</li><li>Detailed, data-driven, multi-scale models of complex behaviour, intelligence, consciousness and language, to study the role of variability in human brain organization during the lifespan, under different conditions.</li><li>Digital brain twins and/or body twins, informed by real-life sensor data, to assist the development of new digital tools for brain medicine, e.g., for diagnostics, rehabilitation, intensive care and surgery.</li><li>A framework for the European Brain Data Space, aligned with the European Health Data Space, in connection to EOSC and linked with common European data spaces in the life science and health sector, to support collaborative digital neuroscience and reproducible brain science, and to bridge basic and clinical research in the context of the European partnership for brain health.</li><li>Strengthened European cooperation advancing brain health research to ensure streamlined efforts, avoiding duplication while maximizing impact particularly in the context of the European Partnership for Brain Health through shared infrastructure, leading to improved diagnostics, innovative therapies, and more personalized treatment plans, ultimately enhancing patient care and public health.</li> </ul><p>EBRAINS is an integrative, distributed digital research infrastructure (RI) of pan-European relevance, developed under the EU-funded Human Brain Project (HBP), to cross-fertilise progress in neuroscience, medicine and advanced computing including AI. While since 2021 EBRAINS is included in the ESFRI roadmap, EBRAINS continues developing as the reference RI for digital neuroscience to help reach a deeper understanding of the human brain and to catalyse new findings in science, and innovative brain-inspired technologies and computing. Furthermore, EBRAINS, as part of the upcoming European Partnership for Brain Health, will facilitate medical innovation providing value added services and access to world-class EU HPC resources to a wide community of professionals, including clinicians, neuro- and computer scientists. Importantly, EBRAINS has potential to contribute to the novel EuroHPC AI Factories and the planned AI Gigafactories, fostering the translation of insights from neuroscience for novel AI, neuro-inspired computing and neurorobotics into business and industry. </p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope of this topic is to support the excellence and attractiveness of the EBRAINS Research Infrastructure by operating existing, improved and new services, advancing scientific and technological discoveries in neurosciences, brain medicine and brain-inspired cognitive technologies, and attracting a wide community of users, including industrial users.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Operate the EBRAINS research infrastructure digital facilities, providing access to a federated supercomputing RI, large data storage, computational capabilities and cloud services, with access to the European HPC capacities towards exascale, and AI Factories and future AI Gigafactories.</li><li>Support the use of EBRAINS digital services by researchers across Europe. Support the development of services involving scientific, medical and industrial stakeholders via co-design approach, including the integration of new data and services from new users and/or EBRAINS national competence nodes, enriching the cloud-based deliveries and facilitating the sharing of produced data and use of national resources.</li><li>Integrate AI tools in EBRAINS services to support intuitive interaction with users, to facilitate brain research, neuroscience data analysis, simulations and biological modelling of the brain, and to support FAIR data indexing and archival to scale-up data integration. This includes developing new foundational models dedicated to the field of neuroscience. The unique multi-scale database with data from the micro to the macro scale hosted by EBRAINS would be one of the essential resources for feeding these models.</li><li>Demonstrate scalability and robustness of the approaches, both technically and operationally. This includes the ability to handle large and complex datasets (e.g., imaging data in the range of terabytes) including associated metadata; the provision of scalable tools and services (e.g., annotation platforms, AI pipelines, secure data handling) that go beyond limited pilot phases or academic prototypes; a clear plan for how the infrastructure or platform proposed will evolve into a robust and continuously available service that can meet the needs of real-world users, including SMEs and clinical stakeholders.</li><li>Develop and integrate in EBRAINS a new collaborative platform for advancing and testing neuro-inspired AI to facilitate brain research, medicine and brain inspired technology, assuring interoperability with other initiatives in the field, and enabling access to strategic brain data.</li><li>Strengthen and build new international collaborations to support digital neuroscience as a global challenge, to ensure that Europe remains at the centre of the global efforts aimed at better understanding the brain, partnering with other main players in the International Brain Initiative, and other initiatives.</li><li>Develop tailored and inclusive training and skills development programmes to facilitate users access, assisting them in their digital experiments and contributing to educating a new generation of scientists and developers at the intersection of neuroscience, computing and AI.</li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to outline how they will contribute to and align with European efforts on health data sharing, particularly in the context of the forthcoming European Health Data Space. This includes implementing FAIR data principles and mechanisms to support data discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability, and addressing how the infrastructure will support real-time or near-real-time data flows, including handling of metadata, harmonisation of data formats, and secure access for authorised users.</p><p>Proposals are expected to identify and build on synergies with other EU Research Infrastructures such as eBRAIN-Health, EUCAIM, Euro-BioImaging, TEF-Health, and other relevant infrastructures supported under Horizon Europe or previous framework programmes, ensuring sustainability, complementarity and coherence at the European level. Collaborations with relevant infrastructures should address technical and semantic interoperability to avoid further fragmentation, sharing tools, standards, and governance models, and will contribute to the broader European ambition of creating a federated, harmonised, and innovation-enabling health data ecosystem.</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More efficient access to the best research infrastructures available to researchers and innovators to conduct basic and applied research and foster innovation, irrespective of location. A single-entry point access portal, integrated or interoperable catalogues of services and converging access conditions and selection procedures;</li><li>A step towards a longer-term sustainable access programme harmonised across different ESFRI domains;</li><li>Breakthrough and leading-edge research enabled by advanced research infrastructure services, including from emerging facilities, made available to a wider user community, including in emerging areas of research;</li><li>A new generation of researchers trained to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research with due attention to early-stage career researchers and researchers from widening countries and candidate countries;</li><li>Interdisciplinarity and sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across scientific fields with due attention to research security; better management, including implementing FAIR data principles, of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by research infrastructures.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic aims at testing ‘access programme like’ projects providing trans-national access (on-site or remote) and/or virtual access to integrated and customised research infrastructure installations and services for excellent research, from frontier and curiosity-driven to applied research, offered by a wide range of complementary and interdisciplinary research infrastructures with experience in transnational access. Access is provided by a core of state-of-the-art research infrastructures as beneficiaries/affiliated entities and by third party access providers on demand. Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures<sup>[1]</sup>.<u> Proposals are expected to address one of the following areas, based on ‘ESFRI scientific domains</u><sup>[2]</sup>,<u> and must explicitly state which area they address</u>:</p><p>Area 1, covering the following domains: Physical Sciences and Engineering; Data, Computing and Digital Research Infrastructures</p><p>Area 2, covering the following domains: Health &amp; Food; Social Sciences and Humanities</p><p>Area 3, covering the following domains: Environment; Energy.</p><p>These areas define in which pilot project a research infrastructure identified as a core access provider should be a beneficiary/affiliated entity. On demand third party access providers should expand access opportunities within the area or across-areas for interdisciplinary research.</p><p>Proposals should make available to researchers and innovators a wide, inclusive and comprehensive portfolio of complementary research infrastructure services of European interest<sup>[3]</sup>, including data services. Proposals should include at least two ESFRI Landmark<sup>[4]</sup> and/or European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC)<sup>[5]</sup> as beneficiary. Access could also be open, in accordance with the ‘Specific Features for Research Infrastructure’ section of this Work Programme, to third countries’ researchers. Research infrastructures from third countries may be involved as beneficiaries or affiliated entities<sup>[6]</sup> when appropriate, if the proposal can demonstrate they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in the EU Member States and Associated Countries.</p><p>Access includes ad hoc users’ training and scientific and technical support (see Specific Features for Research Infrastructures). Additional training courses, including skills for data stewardship, may also be supported. In addition, proposals should better exploit the training potential of successful transnational access user projects by inviting researchers, notably early-stage career researchers, or research infrastructure technicians from widening and candidate countries to team up with selected user groups. Proposals should reserve sufficient resources for this purpose and should proactively advertise these opportunities. (which should be arranged after the selection of user projects and have no impact on their evaluation).</p><p>Access provision to existing services should be clear in the proposed activities and reflected in the allocated resources.</p><p>The improvement and development of services can also be supported, provided that the resulting services are offered already under the actions (short-term R&amp;D) and that the long-term sustainability of such services is ensured.</p><p>Data management (and related ethics issues), interoperability, as well as the connection of digital services (e.g. data services) to the European Open Science Cloud, should be addressed where relevant. Proposals should take due account of major European or international initiatives relevant in the domain. When appropriate, they should foster the use and deployment of (open) global standards.</p><p>Proposals should include an outreach and engagement plan to actively advertise their services to the research communities, notably from widening countries and candidate countries and to relevant industries, including SMEs and, if applicable, provide dedicated support for the development of research partnerships and collaborations with researchers from widening countries and candidate countries. Proposals are expected to exploit synergies and to ensure complementarity and coherence with other EU grants supporting access provision.</p><p>Proposals should include the list of core services/installations<sup>[7]</sup>opened by research infrastructures for transnational or virtual access and the amounts of units of access made available for users. Further conditions and requirements relating to access provisions that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in the “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” section of this work programme part. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.</p><p>Proposals should also present an indicative list of complementary services/installations opened by third party research infrastructures for transnational or virtual access. Proposals should reserve sufficient resources for access notably to these services/installations and allocate budget according to the demand after peer-review evaluation of the user-groups and users’ research and innovation projects, the ‘user projects’. This complementary part of the access to research infrastructures may be implemented through the mechanism of financial support to third parties (FSTP), provided that the beneficiaries ensure that the conditions and requirements relating to access provisions as given in the “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” are fulfilled. In such case, the relevant conditions and requirements should be included in the FSTP calls and the applicants to the FSTP open calls should be the third party research infrastructures demanded by user-group(s). In the case of transnational access, the beneficiaries select the user-groups according to the conditions and requirements of the “specific features for research infrastructures” section of this work programme. The beneficiaries ensure that the access provider selected through the FSTP calls is a state-of-the-art research infrastructure, and that it will provide appropriate documentation to support and justify the amount of access provided and the information on the users as specified in the “specific features for research infrastructures” section of this work programme. To simplify the selection process, proposals under this topic may combine the calls inviting researchers to apply for transnational access and the FSTP calls so that a one stage selection procedure can be implemented based on a joint application from the user group submitting the ‘user project’ and the needed third party access provider. The recipient of the financial support is the third party research infrastructure that is providing access to the selected user-group(s). The financial support should cover the costs incurred by the third party to provide access (actual costs, unit costs, or a combination of the two) plus any work for service customisation as well as the travel and subsistence of users if visits are needed to use the infrastructures. Alternatively, proposals may opt for centrally managed travel and or subsistence costs for all or part of the selected user projects. In such case, these costs are excluded from the concerned FSTP.</p><p>Access opportunities should be presented in a single-entry point portal for each pilot, building on the experience of past EU projects supporting access in the respective areas. The interoperability and capacity to converge into a common portal should be considered when designing or upgrading the portals as well as the possible connection to EOSC.</p><p>To ensure a holistic view from design to implementation of possible access schemes, proposals should ensure strong and continuous collaboration with the cross-domain preparatory action on access HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-DEV-05<sup>[8]</sup>, with the pilots under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2026-01-DEV-02, e.g. making use of the catalogues of services, navigation tool and links to key EU initiatives, and with the actions supported under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-SERV-02. This collaboration should ensure a common front page to all above actions, set up by one of the pilots, providing at the minimum basic information such as highlighting the common objectives of EU supported access, the main conditions and requirements, providing preliminary guidance on access opportunities and directing to the single-entry point portal of each pilot. The collaboration should also promote simplified access pathways, good practices on call conditions, converging access modalities and selection process, as well as effective governance of the set of projects acting as an access programme with appropriate advisory bodies.</p><p>Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) in any of the three areas identified in the call. The JRC is running the “open access to JRC research infrastructures” programme, providing since 2017 access and training and capacity building to a portfolio of 18 different facilities to more than 650 users from 250 institutions in Europe. In this respect, the experience of the JRC in transnational access can be very valuable for exploring new ways of creating large thematic clusters of pan-European research infrastructures. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>The integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. However, where applicable, proposals should promote in their calls for access the integration of the gender dimension in the research and innovation content of the users applying to these calls.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/publication-detail/-/publication/ec4692ae-ac6f-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1\">https://op.europa.eu/publication-detail/-/publication/ec4692ae-ac6f-11ef-acb1-01aa75ed71a1</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] ESFRI domains: 1.

Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Access also includes ad hoc users’ training and scientific and technical support (see Specific Features for Research Infrastructures). Additional training courses, including skills for data stewardship, may also be supported to prepare the new generations of researchers to properly exploit leading-edge research infrastructures. In addition, proposals should exploit the training potential of the successfully selected transnational access user projects by inviting researchers, notably early-stage career researchers, or research infrastructure technical staff from widening and candidate countries. Proposals should reserve sufficient resources for this purpose and should proactively advertise these opportunities (which should be arranged after the selection of user projects and have no impact on their evaluation).</p><p>The main goal of this topic is access provision to existing services: this should be clearly reflected by the proposed activities and the allocated resources. The improvement and development of services, relevant to the challenges, will also be supported, provided the resulting services are opened and offered already under the actions (short term R&amp;D) and that the long-term sustainability of such services is ensured by the participant research infrastructures. Further development of new or improved services for use in the mid-term (2-3 years) may also be supported when duly justified e.g. to address well identified needs such as in the ESFRI Landscape Analysis, or in the research agendas of Horizon Europe Missions or Partnerships or for better serving the needs of open EU industrial research and innovation.</p><p>Data management (and related ethics issues), interoperability, as well as the connection of digital services (e.g. data services) to the European Open Science Cloud, should be addressed where relevant. Proposals should take due account of major European or international initiatives, of major EU priorities relevant in the domain. When appropriate, they should foster the use and deployment of (open) global standards.</p><p>Proposals should make available to researchers a wide, inclusive and comprehensive portfolio of complementary research infrastructure services of European interest<sup>[2]</sup>, including data services, and customised workflows to enable R&amp;I addressing the set challenge. Proposals should include at least one ESFRI Landmark or European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) as beneficiary<sup>[3]</sup>. In case of a distributed ERIC, as an alternative to the ERIC participating as a beneficiary, a legal entity that is hosting ERIC facilities, resources or related services may participate as a beneficiary<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Access could also be open, in accordance with the ‘Specific Features for Research Infrastructure’ section of this Work Programme, to third countries’ researchers. Research infrastructures from third countries<sup> </sup>may be involved when appropriate, including, if the proposal can demonstrate they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in EU Member States and Associated Countries as beneficiaries or affiliated entities<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals should include an outreach and engagement plan to actively advertise their services, to targeted research communities, notably from widening countries and candidate countries, and to relevant industries, including SMEs and, if applicable, provide dedicated support for the development of research partnerships and collaborations with researchers from widening countries and candidate countries. Proposals are expected to exploit synergies and to ensure complementarity and coherence with other EU grants supporting access provision.</p><p>Proposals should include the list of services/installations<sup>[6]</sup> opened by research infrastructures for trans-national or virtual access and the amounts of units of access made available for users. Further conditions and requirements relating to access provisions that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in the “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” section of this work programme part. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.</p><p>The integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. However, where applicable, proposals should mandate in their calls for access the integration of the gender dimension in the research and innovation content of the users applying to these calls.</p><p>Access opportunities should be presented in the single-entry point portal of the most appropriate pilot under HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-SERV-01. The interoperability and capacity to converge into a common portal should be considered when designing or upgrading the portals as well as the possible connection to EOSC.</p><p>To ensure a holistic view from design to implementation of possible access schemes, proposals should ensure strong and continuous collaboration with the cross-domain preparatory action on access HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-DEV-05<sup>[7]</sup>, with the pilots under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2026-01-DEV-02, e.g. making use of the catalogues of services, navigation tool and links to key EU initiatives, and with the actions supported under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2027-01-SERV-01. This collaboration should ensure a common front page to all above actions, set up by one of the pilots, highlighting the common objectives of EU supported access, the main conditions and requirements, providing preliminary guidance on access opportunities and directing to the single-entry point portal of each pilot. The collaboration should also promote, the implementation of simplified access pathways, good practices on call conditions, converging access modalities and selection process, as well as effective governance of the set of projects acting as an access programme with appropriate advisory bodies.</p><p>Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Nanobiotechnology Laboratory for Area 1 and Area 2 (see below) in their research infrastructure portfolio for its expertise at the interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects, and the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment for Area 4 (see below) for its expertise in testing full-scale structures for safety, and materials and structural components under very fast dynamic loads. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.</p><p>The topic targets the following areas related to scientific challenges and EU priorities. <u>Proposals are expected to address one of the areas and must explicitly state which area they address:</u></p><p>Area 1: Advancing cancer research through integrated biomedical infrastructures</p><p>Actions should bring together several complementary and interdisciplinary key research infrastructures relevant for supporting the full cancer research lifecycle, facilitating the development of innovative treatments, including immunotherapies and personalized medicine. Services should include advanced imaging, genomics, and proteomics platforms, as well as clinical trials management, addressing cancer heterogeneity and epigenetics. Proposals should integrate and enable the reuse and sharing of data, samples, and services, and promote the use of artificial intelligence and digital technologies to analyse large datasets and develop predictive models of cancer biology and treatments.</p><p>Appropriate links and complementarities will be ensured with the HE Mission on cancer, EU4Health, and other key European and international initiatives, and when appropriate, build on results from past/ongoing projects, such as those funded under Horizon Europe topic HORIZON-INFRA-SERV-2021-01-01.</p><p>Area 2: Sustainable and resilient agrifood systems and agroecological transitions contributing to EU policies with a One Health approach and fostering EU competitiveness</p><p>Actions should bring together complementary key research infrastructures for enhancing R&amp;I in sustainable agrifood systems and agroecological transitions, consistent with the One Health approach and supporting relevant EU policies and competitiveness.

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>enhanced scientific competitiveness of European research infrastructures;</li><li>enhanced research infrastructure capacity to address research challenges and EU policy priorities;</li><li>increased greening and resilience of research infrastructures;</li><li>increased efficiency of research infrastructures through digitalisation;</li><li>increased collaboration of research infrastructures with universities, research organisations and industry, fostering an innovation ecosystem that provides the foundations for the development of innovative companies and startups while considering EU technological sovereignty;</li><li>fostering the uptake of innovation outside the scientific research market, through co-development with industry of advanced technologies for research infrastructures;</li><li>integration of research infrastructures into local, regional, national and global innovation systems and promotion of entrepreneurial culture.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The aim of this topic is to deliver innovative scientific instrumentation, tools, digitalisation, methods and solutions which advance the state-of-art of research infrastructures (RIs) in the EU and Associated Countries and show transformative potential in RIs operation. The related developments, which underpin the provision of improved and advanced services, should lead RIs to support new areas of research and/or a wider community of users, including industrial users.</p><p>Cutting-edge technologies will also enhance the potential of RIs to contribute to addressing EU policy objectives and socio-economic challenges.</p><p>Proposals should be complementary with actions funded under topics HORIZON-INFRA-2022-TECH-01-01<sup>[1]</sup> and HORIZON-INFRA-2024-TECH-01-01<sup>[2]</sup>, targeting different instrumentation, tools, methods, digitalisation, and solutions. The complementarity with previous actions should be clearly explained in the proposal.</p><p>Proposals should address the following aspects, as relevant:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>research and development of new scientific instrumentation, tools, digitalisation, and methods for research infrastructures;</li><li>their technology validation and prototyping;</li><li>training of RI staff for the operation and use of these new solutions; when relevant, developing skills on technical validation to industrial standards;</li><li>the innovative potential for industrial exploitation of the solutions and/or for the benefits of the society, including technology concept or validation in laboratory for use by SMEs startups or scaleups.</li> </ul><p>To minimise the research infrastructures’ environmental footprint and increase resilience e.g. with respect to energy consumption, climate-related aspects or use of critical components and materials, greening and resilience aspects should be addressed for all proposed scientific instrumentation, tools, methods, digitalisation, and solutions.</p><p>Developments for the specific use case of research infrastructures are expected to go beyond TRL 4. When proposed developments have the potential to lead to applications beyond the specific use case of research infrastructures, the TRL of these additional developments should go up to TRL 3-4.</p><p>Proposals should include at least two different research infrastructures as beneficiaries<sup>[3]</sup> each of them being an ESFRI research infrastructure<sup>[4]</sup> a European Research Infrastructure Consortium<sup>[5]</sup> (ERIC) or another research infrastructure that is an international European research organisation<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Other technological partners, including industry, SMEs, startups or scaleups should also be involved, thus promoting innovation and knowledge sharing through co-development of new technical solutions for research infrastructures with due consideration of EU technological sovereignty.</p><p>Proposals may include PCP<sup>[7]</sup> subcontracting activities as described in part H of the General Annexes of the work programme. This option encourages the use of public procurements for the competitive development of new specific solutions, whilst opening market opportunities for industry and researchers active in the EU and Associated Countries. By establishing the procurement process in consecutive phases, the PCP activity can support the development of competing designs, prototypes, and solution testing. This ensures that investment risks do not prevent tackling specific scientific and technological issues and allows a problem to be approached from different angles and to test different solutions.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to incorporate in the development and deployment of innovation, where applicable, principles in line with the EU’s environmental policies such as Safe and Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD), circular-by-design and others.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. However, where applicable in the proposed developments, proposals should consider the integration of the gender dimension in the research and innovation content.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2022-TECH-01-01\">https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2022-TECH-01-01</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2024-TECH-01-01\">https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2024-TECH-01-01</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] The participation of two nodes of the same ESFRI infrastructure or ERIC does not count as two different research infrastructures.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] See the list of ESFRI 'Landmarks' and ‘Projects’ in the 2021 ESFRI Roadmap: <a href=\"https://roadmap2021.esfri.eu/\">https://roadmap2021.esfri.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/european-research-infrastructures/eric_en\">European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) | European Commission (europa.eu)</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] An ‘international European research organisation' means an international organisation, the majority of whose members are Member States or associated countries, whose principal objective is to promote scientific and technological cooperation in Europe.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] </p><p><em>'Pre-commercial procurement' </em>is defined as procurement of R&amp;D services involving <em>risk-benefit sharing under market conditions </em>and <em>competitive development in phases</em>.

To be able to address the intricate connections between climate change and security to various impact sectors, Europe needs to be equipped with adequate tools, technologies and methods that enable addressing these complex issues and exploit the recent advances in AI, high-performance computing and other new digital technologies.</p><p>Digital twins for civil security require the development of high-accuracy and fast-response models at local and regional levels to strengthen preparedness and resilience, protect EU citizens and raise risk awareness both inside and outside the EU. The topic focuses on new digital twins, or major new components of existing digital twins, to strengthen foresight and anticipation capabilities at the intersection of environment, climate and security. In addition to climate and environmental issues, possible security related impact sectors include, but are not limited to, natural or human-induced disasters, health and related emergencies, energy sustainability and management, migration, or resource scarcity (e.g. food and water). The proposed cross-disciplinary solutions should cover risk mitigation, prevention and foresight, and make use of the Destination Earth system capabilities. The focus is on local and/or regional models, primarily in Europe and its neighbourhood. If necessary, some indicators can also be provided at regional / global levels.</p><p>The work should benefit from rapid advances in modelling, observations and data fusions, artificial intelligence and machine learning, state-of-the art processing and visualisation capabilities, and enable workflows to support users in key impact sectors.</p><p>The proposals should cover the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of new digital twins, or major new components of existing digital twins, to strengthen foresight and anticipation capabilities at the intersection of environment, climate and security in short (operational), medium (tactical) and long-term (strategical) scenarios;</li><li>Demonstrated usability through Minimum Viable Products (MVP) in at least three application areas linking to climate, environment and security, with the involvement of real users;</li><li>Advancing the state-of-the-art in modelling, observations and data fusions, artificial intelligence and machine learning, processing, advanced visualisation capabilities and detection features, and workflows to support users in key impact sectors;</li><li>High computational capacity to implement responsive visualization interfaces that allow advanced visualization capabilities (e.g. 3D, virtual reality, interactive simulations) for decision-makers;</li><li>Coherent integration between satellite and other data (e.g. statistics, in situ, UAV Earth Observation data), and at least two sources in a modular architecture that guarantee the progressive injection of the additional data sources, including high quality observational and other data from the research infrastructures. In case of sensitive datasets, a coherent and comprehensive plan is needed, explaining how the data access will be granted to develop the proposed models and services and how these data will be progressively integrated;</li><li>Clear pathway towards integration with the Destination Earth system, and further development of the data lab infrastructure around Destination Earth for new AI-enabled digital twins using the Data Labs of the AI Factories and integrating them in the DestinE system;</li><li>Enable informed decision-making by non-technical experts and policy makers through assistance of (generative) AI models enabling user requirements analysis and narrowing down vast amounts of data and information into actionable and understandable scenarios;</li><li>Clear pathway towards integration with the Destination Earth system regarding the infrastructure architecture, data and services, and identifying which capacities - depending on the scenario - can be directly used in Destination Earth, and which ones would need to be adapted to deal with sensitive issues;</li><li>Demonstrated trustworthiness in the ethical use of AI;</li><li>Robustness and accuracy of the models to be reliable for security usage.</li> </ul><p>The proposals should demonstrate clearly and with measurable indicators how they contribute to key Union priorities on adapting and preparing for a changing climate, crisis preparedness and disaster resilient society. They should leverage on the relevant parts of the EU’s AI Continent Action Plan.</p><p>The proposals should demonstrate a clear and credible pathway towards collaboration with the implementing entities of Destination Earth initiative (European Space Agency (ESA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)).</p><p>Proposals will need to adhere to the standards and best practices set by the Destination Earth initiative of the European Commission to allow coupling with the existing Destination Earth system. The proposed work is expected to ensure synergies with major European digital twin developments related to security (in particular those of the European Union Satellite Centre<sup>[2]</sup> (SatCen)), and other digital twin developments relevant to the chosen application fields. They should also leverage the knowledge and solutions generated in the relevant Horizon Europe projects, in particular those selected from HORIZON-INFRA-2021-TECH-01, HORIZON-INFRA-2024-TECH-01 and HORIZON-INFRA-2025-TECH-01). Synergies with the Common European Data Spaces<sup>[3]</sup> and in particular with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) are also encouraged.</p><p>Proposals should also aim to address the possible use of the project outcomes in existing or new service offers by the Member States, Associated Countries or the European Union, like the relevant Copernicus services.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] AI Continent Action Plan, COM(2025)165 of 9 April 2025</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <a href=\"https://www.satcen.europa.eu/\">https://www.satcen.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>The objective of this topic is strengthening the European research infrastructure landscape as a pillar of Europe’s innovation-based competitiveness and reinforcing its role in the overarching policy priority of making Europe the top region for deep-tech startups and scaleups. Project results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced scientific and technological competitiveness of European research infrastructures, through the co-development of innovative technologies and solutions that improve the performance of RI services, addressing common needs across different types of research infrastructures, where applicable.</li><li>Increased cooperation and coordination between European research infrastructures, and between them and other public and private research performing organisations, in order to create a coherent and supportive ecosystem for deep-tech innovation in Europe.</li><li>A strengthened role of research infrastructures as centres of gravity for deep-tech innovation ecosystems.</li><li>Strengthened EU innovation capacity and technological sovereignty.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The topic focuses on supporting research infrastructures in developing and implementing innovative technologies and solutions improving the performance of their scientific services, while fostering cooperation with other research organisations, industry, and start-ups and scaleups to maximise the spillover effects of new RI technologies. Proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Co-creation of advanced technologies that address research infrastructures needs, considering resource efficiency and environmental impacts as well as technological sovereignty.</li><li>Development of partnerships and collaborations between research infrastructures and different types of research performing organisations including industry, to co-create technological solutions and promote their uptake and exploitation outside of the science market.</li><li>Shared understanding of the commercial potential of innovative technologies, and support from RI technology transfer teams as early as necessary.</li> </ul><p>Developments for the specific use case of research infrastructures are expected to go beyond TRL 4. When proposed developments have the potential to lead to applications beyond the specific use case of research infrastructures, the TRL of these additional developments should go up to TRL 3-4. Proposers should clearly describe which TRL will be reached at the end of the project for each proposed development.</p><p>Projects are expected to share experiences about co-creation models with the project funded under HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-DEV-05, area 3.</p><p>Proposals may include PCP<sup>[1]</sup> subcontracting activities as described in part H of the General Annexes of the work programme. This option encourages the use of public procurements for the competitive development of new specific solutions, whilst opening market opportunities for industry and researchers active in the EU and Associated Countries. By establishing the procurement process in consecutive phases, the PCP activity can support the development of competing designs, prototypes, and solution testing. This ensures that investment risks do not prevent tackling specific scientific and technological issues and allows a problem to be approached from different angles and to test different solutions.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <em>'Pre-commercial procurement' </em>is defined as procurement of R&amp;D services involving <em>risk-benefit sharing under market conditions </em>and <em>competitive development in phases</em>. PCP focuses on the R&amp;D phase before wide commercialisation. <em>'Risk-benefit sharing under market conditions' </em>refers to the PCP approach in which procurers share with suppliers at market price the risks and the benefits related to the IPR resulting from the R&amp;D. <em>'Competitive development in phases' </em>refers to the competitive approach to buy the R&amp;D from several competing R&amp;D providers in parallel and to compare and identify the best value for money solutions on the market to address the PCP challenge. To reduce the investment risk for the procurer, reward the most competitive solutions and facilitate the participation of smaller innovative companies, the R&amp;D is also split into phases (solution design, prototyping, original development and validation / testing of the first products), with the number of competing R&amp;D providers being reduced after each phase.</p>"

It will also leverage on the recent AI Continent Action Plan and the further development of the data lab infrastructure by bringing together and federating data from different AI Factories, linking to the corresponding Common European Data Spaces and making this data available to AI developers and ensuring their access to large volumes of high-quality data.</p><p>The proposals should cover all following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Planning, designing, and overseeing large-scale experimental pilots and demonstrators by using Destination Earth capabilities in critical impact sectors linked to public policy areas, tackling real-world challenges in relation to climate change adaptation and risk mitigation, and foster solutions that address clearly specified needs at European, national, regional and local scale.</li><li>The pilots and demonstrators should improve the models and enable the coupling of models used in different sectors to combine cross-sectoral research and practice. They should consider the complex interrelationships emerging from the challenges caused and/or exacerbated by climate change, like for example climate-induced health effects or changes in the energy, agri-food or mobility sectors, and propose, test and analyse adaptation and risk mitigation measures in real-life scenarios to be able to respond effectively to these complex challenges in the future.</li><li>The pilots should contribute to the data infrastructure around Destination Earth for new AI-enabled digital twins by using the Data Labs of the AI Factories and integrating them in the DestinE system. Involvement of SMEs and/or startups, active in AI and/or deep tech and working in close collaboration with scientific research community is strongly encouraged.</li><li>The pilots and demonstrators should be co-designed and experimented in at least three Member States and/or Associated Countries in close collaboration between research scientists, AI developers, public sector policy experts and decision-makers.</li><li>The solutions need to demonstrate sustainable set-ups, including through interactivity with digital twins, adapting to changing data and on-demand visualisation capabilities and answering to existing and emerging socio-environmental and socio-economic challenges and the use of AI in solving them.</li> </ul><p>The pilots and demonstrators should fully integrate place-based governance, socio-economic and identity characteristics and other context-specific data to ensure tailored, effective, and actionable responses. They should enable authorities to implement targeted, data-driven measures that enhance resilience, preparedness, and decision-making in their respective territorial contexts.</p><p>Proposals will need to adhere to the standards and best practices set by the Destination Earth initiative to enable interoperability with the Destination Earth system. To the extent possible, the Destination Earth platform should be used as to facilitate the deployment and scalability of the proposed solutions, while enhancing their accessibility and impact across multiple sectors and user communities across Europe.</p><p>To maximize impact, the work plan should include a scalability plan that drives the widespread adoption of the innovative use and solutions powered by Destination Earth, latest technologies, and scientific developments. It should be developed in close collaboration with the relevant public authorities and outline a clear, actionable pathway aiming to secure long-term commitments, including funding, governance and policy framework to ensure lasting impact beyond the projects’ duration.</p><p>The proposals should demonstrate a clear and credible pathway towards collaboration with the implementing entities of Destination Earth initiative (European Space Agency (ESA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)), and other key initiatives active in the intended impact sectors, like Mercator Ocean International, leading the European Digital Twin Ocean initiative.</p><p>The proposals should also leverage the knowledge and solutions generated in the relevant Horizon Europe projects, in particular those selected from HORIZON-INFRA-2021-TECH-01, HORIZON-INFRA-2024-TECH-01 and HORIZON-INFRA-2025-TECH-01. Strong links with the aims, actors and projects serving the Horizon Europe missions, in particular the Climate Adaptation Mission, are encouraged. Synergies with the Common European Data Spaces<sup>[2]</sup> and in particular with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) are also encouraged.</p><p>Proposals should also aim to address the possible use of the project outcomes in existing or new service offers by the Member States, Associated Countries or the European Union, like the relevant Copernicus services.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] AI Continent Action Plan COM(2025)165 of 9 April 2025</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>better structured, integrated and strengthened European research infrastructure landscape;</li><li>solid concepts and/or comprehensive plans for the integrated research infrastructures, to support decision making at national and European level, leading to increased sustainability, operational and financial efficiency;</li><li>increased synergies between research infrastructures;</li><li>increased capacity to address EU policy priorities and/or support EU industry;</li><li>reinforced global competitiveness and attractiveness of the European Research Area.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>This topic targets the consolidation and improved functioning of the EU RI landscape through the support to the development of complementarities, synergies and/or integration between a set (two or more) of ESFRI Landmarks and/or other European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs) or, if duly justified, between one ESFRI Landmark or ERIC and other European research infrastructures of European interest<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Proposals could address either a tighter operational integration between infrastructures, or instead the feasibility and the planning of a merging between infrastructures, which could be targeted in future by a specific topic. The rationale and the potential benefits of the planned consolidation action should be clearly spelled out in the proposals.</p><p>When addressing an operational integration, projects will develop complementarities and/or synergies between infrastructures, at thematic and/or cross-disciplinary level, to optimise the functioning of the RI landscape. The development of complementarities (e.g. through service level agreements for the sharing of horizontal/common services/tools, including external ones) should lead to increased efficiency and prevent unnecessary duplications. Synergies should be exploited to address complex research challenges and EU priorities and should be implemented through cooperation mechanisms ensuring sustainable and long-term integration of services and resources (e.g. common horizontal services, joint scientific services). The needed joint staff skill development, including exchange programmes among the participating RIs, could also be supported.</p><p>When addressing a merging between infrastructures, proposals should provide evidence that the project will effectively involve the funders of the different infrastructures, develop the concept of the merged infrastructure in all its dimensions, including governance, legal form and operation, and define the operational steps and the financial forecast for the actual merging process. Where relevant, pilots for the integration of services and resources (e.g. common horizontal services, joint scientific services) as well as joint staff skill development, including exchange programmes will also be supported.</p><p>Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants notably under the research infrastructures part of the Horizon Europe work programme<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] A research infrastructure is of European interest when it is able to attract users from EU or associated countries other than the country where the infrastructure is located.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Such as under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04: Consolidation of the RI landscape – development of complementarities, synergies and/or integration between a set of pan- European research infrastructures <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04/en\">https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04/en</a></p>"

These ESFRI projects have been selected for the excellence of their scientific case and for their strategic importance for the European Research Area and the structuring of the European research infrastructure ecosystem.</p><p>Proposal consortia should involve all the stakeholders necessary to move the project forward, to take the decisions, and to make financial commitments, before construction can start (including, but not limited to, national/regional ministries/governments, research councils or funding agencies from the countries that have already declared their commitment in the application to ESFRI). Operators of research facilities, research centres, universities, and industry may also be involved whenever appropriate.</p><p>Proposals for research infrastructure preparatory phases should tackle all key questions concerning legal, financial and technical issues leading to the establishment of a new research infrastructure and ensuring commitment of Member States/Associated Countries to their long-term operation and use in all fields of science.</p><p>In this respect, proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the development of legal and financial frameworks/plans relating to the setting-up, construction and/or integration of national resources, operation and decommissioning of the research infrastructure as well as its governance structure; the complementarities between national and EU instruments and/or innovative financing;</li><li>the preparation of legal and financial agreements, including site, governance, internal rules, financing of the new research infrastructures. These are deliverables that should be finalised before the end of the project (e.g.: through a Memorandum of Understanding; a 'signature-ready' document for the setting-up and the actual implementation of the research infrastructure);</li><li>the establishment of plans for logistics and human resources management, in relation to the construction/integration and future operation, including RI service provision as well as for an efficient data curation and preservation and for the provision of access to data collected or produced by the future infrastructure, in line with the FAIR principles;</li><li>the technical challenges concerning the joint development, transfer of knowledge and implementation of key RI technologies and the completion of the final technical design of the infrastructure;</li><li>the development of plans for the provision of RI services to identified scientific user communities;</li><li>the relevance of the RI for science and society, including its socio-economic impacts at local/regional level and links with the smart specialisation strategies at regional level.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants notably under the research infrastructures part of the Horizon Europe work programme.</p><p>When relevant, environmental (including climate-related) impacts as well as the optimisation of resource and energy use should be integrated in the preparatory phase of new or upgraded research infrastructures.</p>"

The rationale and the potential benefits of the planned consolidation action should be clearly spelled out in the proposals.</p><p>When addressing an operational integration, projects will develop complementarities and/or synergies between infrastructures, at thematic and/or cross-disciplinary level, to optimise the functioning of the RI landscape. The development of complementarities (e.g. through service level agreements for the sharing of horizontal/common services/tools, including external ones) should lead to increased efficiency and prevent unnecessary duplications. Synergies should be exploited to address complex research challenges and EU priorities and should be implemented through cooperation mechanisms ensuring sustainable and long-term integration of services and resources (e.g. common horizontal services, joint scientific services). The needed joint staff skill development, including exchange programmes among the participating RIs, could also be supported.</p><p>When addressing a merging between infrastructures, proposals should provide evidence that the project will effectively involve the funders of the different infrastructures, develop the concept of the merged infrastructure in all its dimensions, including governance, legal form and operation, and define the operational steps and the financial forecast for the actual merging process. Where relevant, pilots for the integration of services and resources (e.g. common horizontal services, joint scientific services) as well as joint staff skill development, including exchange programmes will also be supported.</p><p>Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants notably under the research infrastructures part of the Horizon Europe work programme<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] A research infrastructure is of European interest when it is able to attract users from EU or associated countries other than the country where the infrastructure is located.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Such as under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04: Consolidation of the RI landscape – development of complementarities, synergies and/or integration between a set of pan- European research infrastructures <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04/en\">https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/HORIZON_HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-04/en</a></p>"

These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA COFUND.</p><p>Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines (\"bottom-up\"), but exceptionally can also focus on specific disciplines, notably when they are based on national or regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies). In this case, the range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers to define their topic.</p><p>Funding synergies with Cohesion Policy Funds and other EU funding sources are strongly encouraged.</p><p>A Career Development Plan must be jointly established by the supervisor and each recruited researcher upon recruitment. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aimed at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan must be established at the beginning of the recruitment and should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.</p><p>COFUND takes the form of:</p><p><em>A) Doctoral programmes</em></p><p>Doctoral programmes offer research training activities to allow doctoral candidates to develop and broaden their skills and competences. They will lead to the award of a doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The training activities should be based on the <a href=\"http://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/policy_library/principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf\">EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training</a>.</p><p>The doctoral programmes should develop substantial training modules, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI) and fostering the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[1]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, doctoral programmes should adequately prepare doctoral candidates to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p>On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Collaboration with a wider set of associated partners, including from the non-academic sector, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation. These organisations may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training modules in research or transferable skills.</p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS<sup>[2]</sup> website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p><em>B) Postdoctoral Programmes</em></p><p>Postdoctoral programmes fund individual advanced research training and career development fellowships for postdoctoral researchers. The programmes should offer training to develop key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[1]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the postdoctoral programmes should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p>Postdoctoral programmes should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between researchers. The selection procedure for postdoctoral candidates must be open, merit-based and with a transparent international peer review, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes.

These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA COFUND.</p><p>Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines (\"bottom-up\"), but exceptionally can also focus on specific disciplines, notably when they are based on national or regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies). In this case, the range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers to define their topic.</p><p>Funding synergies with Cohesion Policy Funds and other EU funding sources are strongly encouraged.</p><p>A Career Development Plan must be jointly established by the supervisor and each recruited researcher upon recruitment. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aimed at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan must be established at the beginning of the recruitment and should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.</p><p>COFUND takes the form of:</p><p><em>A) Doctoral programmes</em></p><p>Doctoral programmes offer research training activities to allow doctoral candidates to develop and broaden their skills and competences. They will lead to the award of a doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The training activities should be based on the <a href=\"http://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/policy_library/principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf\">EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training</a>.</p><p>The doctoral programmes should develop substantial training modules, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI) and fostering the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[1]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, doctoral programmes should adequately prepare doctoral candidates to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p>On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Collaboration with a wider set of associated partners, including from the non-academic sector, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation. These organisations may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training modules in research or transferable skills.</p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS<sup>[2]</sup> website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p><em>B) Postdoctoral Programmes</em></p><p>Postdoctoral programmes fund individual advanced research training and career development fellowships for postdoctoral researchers. The programmes should offer training to develop key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[1]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the postdoctoral programmes should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p>Postdoctoral programmes should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between researchers. The selection procedure for postdoctoral candidates must be open, merit-based and with a transparent international peer review, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Researchers will be able to freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their individual needs.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup><a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/\">https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p>"

MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.</p><p>These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.</p><p>The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS<sup>[1]</sup> website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Industrial Doctorates</em></p><p>Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Joint Doctorates</em></p><p>Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees<sup>[2]</sup> recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Supervisory Board</em></p><p>Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training<sup>[3]</sup>. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.</p><p>Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.</p><p>Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI) and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[4]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates to pursue a career in research and for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Supervision</em></p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.</p><p><em>RAISE Doctoral Networks</em></p><p>The RAISE Doctoral Networks, implemented through Work Programme Annex 14, Horizontal Activities, provide specific support to networks with primary focus on the use of AI in science.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/\">https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Every time this Work Programme part refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be recognised as such by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/policy_library/principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf\">principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p>"

MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.</p><p>These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.</p><p>The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the European Charter for Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS<sup>[1]</sup> website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Industrial Doctorates</em></p><p>Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Joint Doctorates</em></p><p>Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees<sup>[2]</sup> recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Supervisory Board</em></p><p>Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training<sup>[3]</sup>. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.</p><p>Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.</p><p>Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI) and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[4]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates to pursue a career in research and for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Supervision</em></p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.</p><p><em>RAISE Doctoral Networks</em></p><p>The RAISE Doctoral Networks, implemented through Work Programme Annex 14, Horizontal Activities, provide specific support to networks with primary focus on the use of AI in science.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/\">https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] Every time this Work Programme part refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be recognised as such by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] <a href=\"https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/policy_library/principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf\">principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf</a></p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p>"

MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships will be open to excellent researchers of any nationality. The scheme also encourages researchers to work on research and innovation projects in the non-academic sector and is open to researchers wishing to reintegrate in Europe, to those who are displaced by conflict, as well as to researchers with high potential who are seeking to restart their careers in research.</p><p>Through the implementation of an original and personalised research project, MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships aim to foster excellence through training and mobility and to equip researchers with new skills and competences in order to identify solutions to current and future challenges. Postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to engage with society at large to make the results of their research visible to citizens and to involve citizens, civil society and end-users in co-creation of research content when relevant.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance the creative and innovative potential of researchers holding a PhD and wishing to diversify their individual competences and skills through advanced training, international, interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral mobility while implementing excellent research projects across all sectors of research;</li><li>Strengthen Europe's human capital base in R&amp;I with better trained, innovative and entrepreneurial researchers;</li><li>Enhance the quality of R&amp;I contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth;</li><li>Contribute to Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&amp;I and for good working conditions of researchers;</li><li>Facilitate knowledge transfer and brain circulation across the ERA;</li><li>Foster the culture of open science, innovation and entrepreneurship.</li> </ul>"

Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.</p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><u>European Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.</li><li><u>Global Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to European nationals or long-term residents<sup>[1]</sup> who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.</li> </ul><p>Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.</p><p>For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed half of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p>For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to half of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.</p><p>Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[3]</sup>. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[4]</sup>. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p>If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should integrate key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[5]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the Postdoctoral Fellowships should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p><em>Euratom</em></p><p>Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme, are eligible to participate<sup>[6]</sup>. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p><em>ERA Fellowships</em></p><p>The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country<sup>[8]</sup>. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme </p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] idem</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] As indicated in the Euratom Work Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] These countries are aligned with Work Programme part 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area</p>"

          "<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Outcome:</span><p>Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><p>For supported postdoctoral fellows</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of MSCA postdoctoral fellows within academia and beyond;</li><li>New mind-sets and approaches to R&amp;I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;</li><li>Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact.</li> </ul><p>For participating organisations</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers;</li><li>Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;</li><li>Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);</li><li>Stronger R&amp;I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of knowledge;</li><li>Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers undertaking international mobility. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.</p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><u>European Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.</li><li><u>Global Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to European nationals or long-term residents<sup>[1]</sup> who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.</li> </ul><p>Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.</p><p>For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed half of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p>For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to half of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.</p><p>Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[3]</sup>. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[4]</sup>. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p>If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should integrate key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[5]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the Postdoctoral Fellowships should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p><em>Euratom</em></p><p>Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme, are eligible to participate<sup>[6]</sup>. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p><em>ERA Fellowships</em></p><p>The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country<sup>[8]</sup>. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme </p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] idem</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] As indicated in the Euratom Work Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] These countries are aligned with Work Programme part 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area</p>"

Such a project must explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must involve physical mobility<sup>[1]</sup> of the eligible staff members and must always take place between legal entities independent from each other.</p><p>MSCA Staff Exchanges can address different dimensions of mobility: international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary<sup>[2]</sup>. Exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, but same-sector exchanges are also possible. Interdisciplinarity is particularly encouraged for secondments between academic organisations.</p><p>The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. The secondments should be essential to achieve the joint project’s R&amp;I activities. The project should <em>inter alia </em>enable networking activities and the organisation of workshops and conferences, to facilitate sharing of knowledge and testing of innovative approaches for specific R&amp;I topics.</p><p><em>Skills’ development</em></p><p>For participating staff members, the project should offer new skills acquisition and career development perspectives. Participating organisations must ensure that the seconded staff are adequately mentored.

International cooperation through the participation of organisations from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Support is provided for international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility of R&amp;I staff leading to knowledge transfer between participating organisations.</p><p><em>Mobility through secondments</em></p><p>The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a joint R&amp;I project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Such a project must explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must involve physical mobility<sup>[1]</sup> of the eligible staff members and must always take place between legal entities independent from each other.</p><p>MSCA Staff Exchanges can address different dimensions of mobility: international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary<sup>[2]</sup>. Exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, but same-sector exchanges are also possible. Interdisciplinarity is particularly encouraged for secondments between academic organisations.</p><p>The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. The secondments should be essential to achieve the joint project’s R&amp;I activities. The project should <em>inter alia </em>enable networking activities and the organisation of workshops and conferences, to facilitate sharing of knowledge and testing of innovative approaches for specific R&amp;I topics.</p><p><em>Skills’ development</em></p><p>For participating staff members, the project should offer new skills acquisition and career development perspectives. Participating organisations must ensure that the seconded staff are adequately mentored. Proposals should clearly describe how planned international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary secondments will expose seconded staff to different skills, working cultures or career trajectories.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] <sup> </sup>Virtual mobility is not allowed for secondments.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] <sup> </sup>Interdisciplinarity means the integration of information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts or theories from two or more scientific disciplines (see definitions at the end of this Work Programme part).</p>"

          "<p>MSCA and Citizens aims to bring research and researchers closer to the public at large, to increase awareness of research and innovation activities and to boost public recognition of science and research education. It will show the role of the researcher for the society and economy, as well as the impact of researchers’ work on citizens’ daily lives. It also aims to raise the interest of young people in research and scientific careers.</p><p>MSCA and Citizens will address the general public, attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a specific focus on families, pupils, students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in, STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities. Inclusiveness should be key, in view of broadening access to science and research to all.</p><p>MSCA and Citizens should also promote gender balance and inclusiveness in science, Open Science, and Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>These objectives will be pursued through the organisation of the European Researchers’ Night and the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night is the largest research communication and promotion event taking place across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. A wide geographic coverage that reflects the European nature of this initiative is key.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative aims to strengthen the connection between research and education. It brings school classes to research facilities and researchers to schools or other pedagogical and educational centres, encouraging interaction with pupils at all levels of education. Researchers and pupils will meet to talk about current and future challenges of our societies and the related key role of research. Pupils will learn directly about research projects and activities addressing the EU priorities and main orientations.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance engagement with citizens on R&amp;I;</li><li>Increase awareness among the general public of the importance and benefits of R&amp;I, especially EU-funded research, and its concrete impact on citizens’ daily life;</li><li>Contribute to the diffusion and the promotion of excellence research projects across Europe and beyond by reaching citizens in as many participating countries as possible;</li><li>Raise the interest of young people in science and research careers;</li><li>Support school teachers and educators by showcasing real-life applications of research projects and creating a learning opportunity for pupils through a direct interaction with researchers.</li> </ul>"

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings school classes to research facilities and researchers to schools or other pedagogical and educational centres. This allows researchers to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus learn directly about research projects.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European and Europe-wide event. Additionally, each proposal should promote the European Union, EU-funded research and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. They can take various forms, such as presentations, discussions, speed-dating, citizen science, science shows, summer schools, nature walks or visits to research facilities. Where appropriate, researchers should receive training ahead of the activities on science communication, especially targeting a young audience. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.</p><p>Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.</p><p>Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.</p><p>Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps.</p><p>Where appropriate, synergies should be sought with the newly created Science Comes To Town initiative, implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area.</p><p>High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.</p><p>Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.</p><p>The maximum requested EU contribution per proposal should not exceed EUR 350 000. All proposals are encouraged to bring additional sources of funding. The budget will be evaluated under the criterion 3 “Quality and efficiency of the implementation”. Proposals that exceed this maximum EU contribution might be penalised during the evaluation unless a strong justification is provided.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2028 and 2029, including the organisation of two successive editions (2028 and 2029) of the European Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project duration. Applicants should clearly state how they will communicate and promote the European nature of this action.</p>"

          "<p>MSCA and Citizens aims to bring research and researchers closer to the public at large, to increase awareness of research and innovation activities and to boost public recognition of science and research education. It will show the role of the researcher for the society and economy, as well as the impact of researchers’ work on citizens’ daily lives. It also aims to raise the interest of young people in research and scientific careers.</p><p>MSCA and Citizens will address the general public, attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a specific focus on families, pupils, students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in, STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities. Inclusiveness should be key, in view of broadening access to science and research to all.</p><p>MSCA and Citizens should also promote gender balance and inclusiveness in science, Open Science, and Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>These objectives will be pursued through the organisation of the European Researchers’ Night and the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night is the largest research communication and promotion event taking place across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. A wide geographic coverage that reflects the European nature of this initiative is key.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative aims to strengthen the connection between research and education. It brings school classes to research facilities and researchers to schools or other pedagogical and educational centres, encouraging interaction with pupils at all levels of education. Researchers and pupils will meet to talk about current and future challenges of our societies and the related key role of research. Pupils will learn directly about research projects and activities addressing the EU priorities and main orientations.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance engagement with citizens on R&amp;I;</li><li>Increase awareness among the general public of the importance and benefits of R&amp;I, especially EU-funded research, and its concrete impact on citizens’ daily life;</li><li>Contribute to the diffusion and the promotion of excellence research projects across Europe and beyond by reaching citizens in as many participating countries as possible;</li><li>Raise the interest of young people in science and research careers;</li><li>Support school teachers and educators by showcasing real-life applications of research projects and creating a learning opportunity for pupils through a direct interaction with researchers.</li> </ul>"

It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.</p><p>The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.</p><p>The Researchers at Schools initiative brings school classes to research facilities and researchers to schools or other pedagogical and educational centres. This allows researchers to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus learn directly about research projects.</p><p><em>Types of activities</em></p><p>European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European and Europe-wide event. Additionally, each proposal should promote the European Union, EU-funded research and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.</p><p>Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. They can take various forms, such as presentations, discussions, speed-dating, citizen science, science shows, summer schools, nature walks or visits to research facilities. Where appropriate, researchers should receive training ahead of the activities on science communication, especially targeting a young audience. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.</p><p>Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.</p><p>Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.</p><p>Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps.</p><p>Where appropriate, synergies should be sought with the newly created Science Comes To Town initiative, implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area.</p><p>High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.</p><p>Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.</p><p>The maximum requested EU contribution per proposal should not exceed EUR 350 000. All proposals are encouraged to bring additional sources of funding. The budget will be evaluated under the criterion 3 “Quality and efficiency of the implementation”. Proposals that exceed this maximum EU contribution might be penalised during the evaluation unless a strong justification is provided.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2028 and 2029, including the organisation of two successive editions (2028 and 2029) of the European Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project duration. Applicants should clearly state how they will communicate and promote the European nature of this action.</p>"

Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.</p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><u>European Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.</li><li><u>Global Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to European nationals or long-term residents<sup>[1]</sup> who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.</li> </ul><p>Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.</p><p>For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed half of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p>For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to half of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.</p><p>Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[3]</sup>. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[4]</sup>. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p>If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should integrate key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[5]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the Postdoctoral Fellowships should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p><em>Euratom</em></p><p>Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme, are eligible to participate<sup>[6]</sup>. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p><em>ERA Fellowships</em></p><p>The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country<sup>[8]</sup>. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] idem</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] As indicated in the Euratom Work Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] These countries are aligned with Work Programme part 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area</p>"

          "<p>The goal of MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative potential of researchers holding a PhD and who wish to acquire new skills through advanced training, international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships will be open to excellent researchers of any nationality. The scheme also encourages researchers to work on research and innovation projects in the non-academic sector and is open to researchers wishing to reintegrate in Europe, to those who are displaced by conflict, as well as to researchers with high potential who are seeking to restart their careers in research.</p><p>Through the implementation of an original and personalised research project, MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships aim to foster excellence through training and mobility and to equip researchers with new skills and competences in order to identify solutions to current and future challenges. Postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to engage with society at large to make the results of their research visible to citizens and to involve citizens, civil society and end-users in co-creation of research content when relevant.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance the creative and innovative potential of researchers holding a PhD and wishing to diversify their individual competences and skills through advanced training, international, interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral mobility while implementing excellent research projects across all sectors of research;</li><li>Strengthen Europe's human capital base in R&amp;I with better trained, innovative and entrepreneurial researchers;</li><li>Enhance the quality of R&amp;I contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth;</li><li>Contribute to Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&amp;I and for good working conditions of researchers;</li><li>Facilitate knowledge transfer and brain circulation across the ERA;</li><li>Foster the culture of open science, innovation and entrepreneurship.</li> </ul>"

Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.</p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><u>European Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.</li><li><u>Global Postdoctoral Fellowships</u> are open to European nationals or long-term residents<sup>[1]</sup> who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.</li> </ul><p>Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p><em>Secondments</em></p><p>Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.</p><p>For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed half of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p>For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to half of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.</p><p>Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[3]</sup>. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country<sup>[4]</sup>. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p>If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should integrate key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, including digital ones (e.g. generative AI), and foster the culture of Open Science, knowledge valorisation<sup>[5]</sup>, and when applicable innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, the Postdoctoral Fellowships should empower fellows to pursue a career in research and adequately prepare them for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.</p><p><em>Euratom</em></p><p>Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme, are eligible to participate<sup>[6]</sup>. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call<sup>[7]</sup>.</p><p><em>ERA Fellowships</em></p><p>The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country<sup>[8]</sup>. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[2] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[3] For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[4] idem</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[5] “Knowledge valorisation” is the process of creating social and economic value from knowledge by linking different areas and sectors and by transforming data, know-how and research results into sustainable products, services, solutions and knowledge-based policies that benefit society” (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022H2415&amp;qid=1670573108748\">EUR-Lex - 32022H2415 - EN - EUR-Lex</a>).</p><p>For more guidance on specific areas of knowledge valorisation, see the European Commission’s Codes of Practice on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0499&amp;qid=1678171231088\">intellectual assets management</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023H0498&amp;qid=1678171117168\">standardisation</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0774&amp;qid=1709626992959\">industry-academia co-creation</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024H0736&amp;qid=1709626992959\">citizen engagement</a> for knowledge valorisation</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[6] See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[7] As indicated in the Euratom Work Programme</p><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[8] These countries are aligned with Work Programme part 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area</p>"
