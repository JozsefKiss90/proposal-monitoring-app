          "scope": "Biomarkers [1] are invaluable tools for improving patient outcomes, guiding treatment decisions, accelerating personalised medicine, more effective clinical research and the development of better medicines.\nHowever, despite the scientific discoveries of many clinically relevant biomarkers, estimated on the scale of tens of thousands, only a few biomarkers have been implemented in clinical practice. The traditional ‘one biomarker’ paradigm is insufficient for addressing the unmet clinical needs of chronic, progressive and multifactorial diseases, due to the complexity of the clinical phenotypes characterised by broad inter-and intra-patient heterogeneity. The established biomarkers have limitations in their use as prognostic and predictive indicators, for the assessment of the disease progression and the choices of the optimal therapeutic interventions tailored to the patients’ characteristics.\nTherefore, the topic focuses on the clinical development of predictive biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response for chronic non-communicable diseases (excluding cancer) by using established AI methodologies able to combine data of clinically used and candidate biomarkers, with available data from relevant clinical studies, longitudinal and Real-World Data (RWD) [2] . This topic is expected to support collaborative projects paving the way for future innovations in personalised medicine and enabling more timely and effective therapeutic interventions.\nThe proposals should address all the following research and innovation activities:\n• Set-up a multidisciplinary collaboration to map and evaluate the available information and data on biomarkers currently used in the clinical setting, candidate biomarkers from past and ongoing clinical studies, which are scientifically proven as clinically relevant to the disease progression and treatment response for the chronic non-communicable diseases under study. This should include stratification by biological sex, and where feasible, integration of gender-related variables and sociodemographic determinants that may modulate disease trajectories or treatment efficacy.\n• Adapt and apply of established AI methods rather than developing novel ones from scratch, to deliver novel predictive biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response, by integrating data of currently used and candidate biomarkers, with suitable data from available longitudinal and other relevant clinical studies, including RWD, as necessary. To guarantee a solid and fast optimisation and training of the AI tools, the applicants should provide information in their proposal that the appropriate high-quality clinical data are readily available, and when necessary generate small-scale new data for the AI optimisation needs. The biomarkers under study should be multimodal, covering for instance molecular, cellular, physiological, imaging, behavioural and digital markers, and/or their combinations. The applicants should justify why the development of the biomarkers proposed is imperative to tackle the unmet clinical needs of the chronic non-communicable diseases under study.\n• Use AI and, where needed, other relevant data and knowledge integration methods, to describe the relationships among different biomarkers and support the robust prioritisation of predictive biomarkers tailored to the characteristics of the patients’ and their disease stage and treatment response. Proposals should have strong emphasis on the AI trustworthiness [3] and develop the adequate performance metrics to assess their accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, including the assessment of possible inherent bias. Use of AI and dataset should comply with existing privacy-preserving legislation. Moreover, proposals should consider the development of user-friendly and fit-for-purpose visualisation and decision-support tools to guide clinicians in evaluating the clinical plausibility of the biomarkers under study across diverse patient groups.\n• Establish a biomarker validation platform to assess the clinical utility of the predictive biomarkers identified. To this end, the applicants should implement clinical validation studies in independent disease cohorts, RWD and exploratory clinical studies, as appropriate, to demonstrate their clinical value as prognostic and predictive indicators for more effective clinical research and better patient health outcomes as compared to the established clinical practice of chronic non-communicable diseases. Prospective clinical studies are expected to be led by entities in the EU/EFTA and/or Associated Countries.\n• Develop a comprehensive exploitation plan for the valorisation of the research outputs and a regulatory strategy to support the alignment to the regulatory requirements for the qualification of the biomarkers and/or AI tools and engage with the regulators in a timely manner. The applicants should prioritise the exploitation of their research results in the EU. Participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [4] is encouraged with the aim to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of SMEs and valorise their health innovations.\nProposals should apply good practices for GDPR [5] compliant personal data protection.\nProposals are encouraged, where relevant, to exploit the available data services, expertise and digital tools offered by the relevant European research infrastructures [6] and/or data infrastructures [7] in the area of health funded under the Digital Europe Programme.\nAll proposals selected for funding under this topic will be strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities (e.g. participation in joint workshops, development of best practices, or joint communication activities), which may also involve networking with projects funded under Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes (e.g. the Digital Europe Programme [8] ). The proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for networking and joint activities, without the prerequisite to detail such activities at the proposal stage.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [9] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] See definition as in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the Innovative Health Initiative Joint Undertaking: http://www.ihi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/Documents/About/IHI_SRIA_ApprovedJan22.pdf\n[2] EMA definition: “Real-World Data are routinely collected data relating to patient health status or the delivery of healthcare from a variety of sources other than traditional clinical trials (e.g. claims databases, hospital data, electronic health records, registries, mhealth data, etc.)”.\n[3] See introduction to this Work Programme part as well as the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, published by the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai and the Ethics by Design and Ethics of Use Approaches for Artificial Intelligence https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ethics-by-design-and-ethics-of-use-approaches-for-artificial-intelligence_he_en.pdf\n[4] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361\n[5] General Data Protection Regulation: https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection_en , https://gdpr-info.eu\n[6] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[7] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/artificial-intelligence-health\n[8] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\n[9] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

          "scope": "Tissue-specific functional 3D bio-printing of living cells has made significant progress as a new approach for transplantation applications in regenerative medicine. There are currently several types of bio-printing technologies under development for the repair of different targeted tissues or organs. To fully unleash the potential of bio-printed cell constructs for regenerative medicine several bottlenecks still need to be overcome. Various studies in pre-clinical models have shown that bio-printed cell constructs or tissues hold great promise for regenerative medicine, by allowing autologous tissue grafts being printed thus avoiding adverse graft-host reactions. However, translation of such approaches into clinical settings (i.e. humans) and their application to internal organs still needs to be investigated and demonstrated. Dependant on the actual target site (i.e. the defect tissue or organ in the human body) different bio-printing approaches may be preferable. For printing complex tissues and especially entire organs an in-vitro approach followed by transplantation is the preferred way. “In-situ” bio-printing, sometimes also referred to as “in-vivo”, or as “intraoperative”, reflects a bioprinting process performed on a live subject in a surgical setting and has in certain instances (e.g. tissue repair) advantages over an in-vitro bio-printing technique followed by transplantation. In-situ bio-printing involves direct patterning of bio-inks onto a patient’s body at the target site, allowing for precise construction of a site-matching tissue-structure within the actual physiological location where regeneration or repair is needed. As such, in-situ bio-printing allows for high adaptability, reduced risk of contamination, improved cell viability, function and host integration. The high cell densities present in the human vital organs underscore the importance of bio-inks which contain less additional biomaterials as matrix. Hence the bio-printing of cell constructs that comprise native tissue-like cell densities may facilitate repair and/or regeneration of defective complex tissues or internal organs. For such approaches meticulous engineering of the bio-printing equipment is necessary, involving sophisticated micro-surgical instrumentation and medical imaging platforms. To achieve the desired function and to mimic the natural cues in native tissues for in-vitro printed bio-constructs, the use of additional stimuli is needed, whereas in-situ approaches normally rely on the body as natural bioreactor providing the necessary extracellular cues. Recently, combinations of in-situ bio-printing with real-time stimuli have been investigated, even for the repair of internal organs. However, there remain bottlenecks that need to be overcome, like the integration with existing imaging modalities and surgical procedures or the long-time stability and functionality of the created bio-constructs.\nTo address these challenges, researchers should work in multidisciplinary teams with engineers, biomedical scientists, cell biologists and medical doctors. Proposals should be based on the use of human cells and address all the following activities:\n• Develop or improve existing bioprinting equipment that comprises all steps of the bio-printing suite to print bio-constructs with high cell-density for improved vascularisation and faster repair of the defect in the body.\n• Scale-up the chosen bio-printing technology to a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [1] conform/compliant manufacturing process.\n• Perform all necessary regulatory work enabling the conduct of clinical studies and assess the clinical value of the developed bio-printing technology in first in-human studies.\nPriority should be given to bio-printing approaches that either target vital internal organs followed by surgical grafting or employ in-situ approaches depositing the cell-laden bioink directly from the printhead or endoscope on the defect target site in the body.\nRegulatory knowledge of the field is desired and should be documented through contacts with relevant national or international European regulatory authorities. A good understanding of the different steps involved and the inherent risks in each of these steps will be a basis to identify appropriate safety and quality requirements. Requirements from the different established EU frameworks on Substances of Human Origin (SoHO), medical devices and pharmaceuticals including Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) should be considered for manufacturing/preparation as well as for clinical outcome monitoring. A combination of requirements from different frameworks might be most appropriate to allow for responsible and fast uptake.\nProposals under this topic may address any therapeutic area, i.e. any disease, dysfunction or defect. Sex differences at the cellular level should be taken into consideration.\nPreclinical stage and clinical development are eligible. The involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [2] is encouraged.\nThe European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) may contribute to the proposals selected for funding with work on strategic technologies for economic security and innovative industrial ecosystems, particularly activities on innovation in vitro biotechnologies.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [3] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

Methodologies may include and are not limited to biophysics-based modelling, artificial intelligence (AI) that should be interpretable or allow explainability of outcomes, generative AI and in-silico modelling, agent-based and network physiology approaches. Evaluation, selection and extension of these should be documented during the design phase. Availability and integration of the multi-modal data should be documented, and the ethical and sex dimensions be investigated.\n• Demonstrate integration of these models with other advanced preventive and diagnostic modalities, tools and techniques enabling integration across pathways.\n• Generate evidence, including clinical validation, that the solutions deliver clinically meaningful decision support, addressing use case requirements. Document lessons-learned for broader application. Gather evidence via health economic and/or feasibility studies in real-world healthcare settings confirming cost-effectiveness vis-à-vis current practice (e.g. cost-effectiveness analysis). Produce an exploitation plan on regulatory compliance [5] and intellectual property.\nProposals should be multidisciplinary; solution design and development should be end-user-focused and draw on user and non-user input. Best practice in VHT software development including responsible AI development should be followed (e.g. risk assessment and management, requirements definition process).\nParticipation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [6] is encouraged.\nProposals should contribute to the objectives of the European VHT Initiative [7] and to the Platform for Advanced VHT Models, with project assets made available on the Platform and interoperable with its technical specifications [8] ; relevant consortia members should join its User Community. Budget should be reserved for these activities. Projects are expected to collaborate with other EU-funded projects on VHTs [9] and align with relevant EU initiatives funded under Horizon Europe, the Digital Europe Programme [10] and the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [11] , e.g. European Cancer Imaging Initiative [12] , 1+Million Genomes Initiative [13] , Intensive Care Unit Data Space [14] , co-funded European Partnership for Personalised Medicine [15] , and projects on advancing AI in health where relevant.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [16] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers and innovators benefit from an improved understanding of how to develop and use the next generation of frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for healthcare, including how to leverage AI Factories and how to combine and expand the capabilities of existing foundation models towards inclusive and personalised medicine.\n• Researchers and innovators benefit from an improved understanding of how to leverage highly heterogeneous and multimodal health data spanning a range of anatomical scales (i.e. the micro to the macro level).\n• Multidisciplinary stakeholders have access to a collaboratively created roadmap for developing the next generation of frontier AI models for healthcare, towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for healthcare.",
          "scope": "The AI Continent Action Plan [1] identifies the health sector, encompassing life sciences, medical devices and healthcare delivery, as one of the key strategic sectors. The action will contribute to making European life sciences [2] and healthcare more impactful and productive by fostering the full integration of advanced AI in the health sector and biomedical research, along the objectives of the AI in Science strategy [3] and Apply AI strategy [4] .\nHealthcare typically involves the combining of multimodal data, ranging from electronic health records through imaging and laboratory to molecular and omics data. This information combination is performed by specialists and is often challenging towards optimised patient care. In Europe, the growing amount of accessible multimodal health data, including via the forthcoming European Health Data Space (EHDS) [5] , combined with the increasing availability of high-performance computing facilities (e.g. AI Factories), presents a unique opportunity to develop the next generation of frontier AI models for healthcare. This action anticipates and operationalises the use of such federated infrastructures for research and innovation. Moreover, regulations such as the EHDS regulation and AI Act [6] steer the direction into building an ecosystem fostering ethical and safe innovation on AI in healthcare.\nAI models are becoming increasingly complex and able to tackle increasingly challenging tasks. The next generation of frontier AI models are expected to make strides towards AGI, a type of AI capable of tackling highly complex and diverse tasks with proficiency comparable to that of humans. This topic will lay the foundation for the development of the next generation of frontier AI models, paving the way for new, advanced AI-powered solutions to increase efficiency and efficacy in the health sector towards improved patient outcomes. It will leverage results, methodologies, data etc. of other relevant EU-funded projects.\nProposals should include all the following coordination and support activities, ensuring multidisciplinary approaches and a broad representation of stakeholders in the consortium (e.g. healthcare professionals, patients, biomedical scientists, AI developers, data engineers, ethics experts):\n• Community building: build a large-scale and diverse pan-European community of stakeholders with the multidisciplinary expertise united as required to develop the next generation of frontier AI models for healthcare, towards AGI for healthcare, with a view to leveraging as a community the potential of AI Factories. Where relevant, this should build on and strengthen existing EU-funded communities and networks, and could pave the way for a formalised long-term collaboration under one of the available EU instruments.\n• Roadmap creation: review previous research to identify the most promising AI models and model development approaches. In addition, risk assess and review evidence on safety and efficacy of existing AI models with reference to the AI Act, related regulatory provisions (including any jurisprudence) and ethical and security considerations, so that frontier AI model development can proceed on a well-informed basis. Finally, create a roadmap for developing the next generation of frontier AI models.\n• Dataset identification, curation, expansion and use: i) identification: identify the most suitable existing datasets for the development of frontier AI models for healthcare, ii) curation: identify how to validate the datasets, ensure dataset interoperability, and convert datasets into formats suitable for frontier AI model development, iii) expansion: identify additional datasets and/or annotations required for frontier AI model development, especially to ensure that datasets are representative and iv) use: identify methods and required infrastructure to allow privacy-preserving use and further expansion of the datasets in alignment with and through the EHDS.\n• Frontier AI model preparatory activities: mapping approaches for training and evaluating frontier AI models (e.g. approaches to combine foundation models for life sciences and healthcare delivery in order to develop more advanced and multidisciplinary models towards personalised medicine). The approaches should cover all trustworthy AI aspects [7] .\nThis action should take into account the results of other relevant projects on AI in health, in particular in the two GenAI4EU topics HORIZON-HLTH-2025-01-CARE-01: “End user-driven application of Generative Artificial Intelligence models in healthcare (GenAI4EU)” and HORIZON-HLTH-2025-01-TOOL-03: “Leveraging multimodal data to advance Generative Artificial Intelligence applicability in biomedical research (GenAI4EU)”, and leverage the AI Factories and specialised health data infrastructures funded under the Digital Europe Programme [8] , biobanks, relevant ERICs [9] , as well as the data resources accessible through the EHDS infrastructure starting in 2029, funded under EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [10] .\n[1] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ai-continent-action-plan\n[2] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/jobs-and-economy/towards-strategy-european-life-sciences_en ; https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1686\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/artificial-intelligence-ai-science_en\n[4] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/commission-launches-public-consultation-and-call-evidence-apply-ai-strategy\n[5] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[6] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n[7] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai\n[8] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\n[9] European Research Infrastructure Consortia: https://www.eric-forum.eu/the-eric-landscap\n[10] https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/eu4health_en",

The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. As a co-funded European Partnership, providing financial support to third parties (FSTP) is a core activity of this action in order to achieve its objectives. Consequently, the EUR 60 000 threshold laid down in Article 207 of Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 does not apply. The maximum amount of FSTP that may be awarded to any single third party for the duration of the partnership is set at EUR 10.00 million. This ceiling is justified by the fact that FSTP is a primary activity of this action, by its expected duration of 7-10 years (exceeding a standard project lifespan), and by the extensive experience gained under predecessor partnerships. This ceiling is also justified by the fact that personalised medicine being at the forefront of medical approaches, requires the use of state-of-the-art technologies and tailored clinical trials which are usually expensive. However, if the objectives of the action would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult (and duly justified in the proposal) the maximum amount may be higher.\nThe starting date of the grant awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the application. Applicants must justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their application. Costs incurred from the starting date of the action may be considered eligible (and will be reflected in the entry into force date of the amendment to the grant agreement).\nThe granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.\nLegal and financial set-up of the grants are described in\nAnnex G\nof the Work Programme General Annexes.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Healthcare professionals dispose of diagnostic tools at the point of care that accelerate therapeutic decision making.\n• Patients benefit from fast and accurate diagnosis leading to improved health outcomes.\n• Thanks to more efficient diagnosis, health systems will get better evidence for disease control and prevention strategies.",
          "scope": "Point-of-Care (PoC) medical testing has made great technical progress (e.g. improved extraction, microfluidics, miniaturisation, and data processing techniques) with PoC test accuracies nearly matching those of lab-based tests. PoC tests may thus be an alternative to laboratory testing methods, enabling faster diagnostic results and therapeutic decision making. However, PoC testing is not always achieving a completely accurate diagnosis and one of the major issues with PoC diagnostics is the occurrence of false results during testing, another one is the often-cumbersome sample preparation. Hence there is a need for PoC diagnostics that are more sensitive, selective and easy-to-use allowing for improved clinical practice.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a set of criteria for PoC diagnostics in primary care which, in the advent of digital technologies, has been completed with two additional features and is represented by the acronym REASSURED: R eal-time connectivity, E ase of specimen collection and environmental friendliness, A ffordable, S ensitive, S pecific, U ser-friendly, R apid and robust, E quipment-free (or equipment-modest) and D eliverable to end users. To these criteria adds the feature of “sample-to-answer” (sometimes also called “sample-to-result”) and more challenges like: Miniaturisation, power supply, versatility (nature and origin of the human sample), biocompatibility of the used materials and their suitability for mass production, readiness for high-throughput testing, quality control, regulatory compliance, environmental footprint and, last but not least, cost, which is of particular concern in resource-limited settings. All these challenges are not only valid for PoC diagnostics developed for infectious diseases, they equally apply to those that are designed to detect non-communicable diseases as well as their continuous monitoring on patients. Mobile technologies are playing an important role, especially since around 70% of the globally 7.4 billion cell phone users live in developing countries, which are the areas in direct need of advanced and more accessible PoC diagnostics (lower density of relevant health infrastructure, e.g. hospitals and laboratory medicine testing facilities). Mobile phones have not only been proposed and tested for data acquisition and readout of assays, images and other results but also for sample processing (e.g. for heating step), as have been Machine-Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) powered algorithms that are integrated in the diagnostic devices to analyse complex biological data and detect patterns that might be missed by human analysis.\nThe selection of the PoC device to be developed or optimised should be based on an objectively conducted clinical needs assessment, which includes -next to clinicians’ perspectives- the complete care pathway and system-level needs. Moreover, a value-based concept should be applied in the choice and development of the PoC device, taking into account its Health Technology Assessment (HTA) by the relevant HTA bodies, in order to facilitate their decisions for adoption.\nProposals should be driven by a clear clinical need, integrate a value-based concept and include all the following activities:\n• The optimisation of (the) targeted PoC diagnostic device(s) that take(s) the above-mentioned criteria, challenges and aspects into consideration.\n• The elaboration of a comparative study clearly demonstrating the added value and improved performance of the optimised PoC diagnostic device(s) as compared to the current state of the art for the targeted diagnostic application.\n• The conduct of clinical studies of (the) optimised PoC diagnostic medical device(s) as a preferred information source for their clinical validation; subsequent conformity assessment in agreement with requisite EU’s In-Vitro Medical Device (IVDR) or Medical Device (MDR) regulatory requirements.\nIn general, priority should be given to approaches that are suitable for resource-limited settings. In case of targeting infectious diseases, priority should be given to approaches enabling the distinction between viral, bacterial or fungal infections. In case of targeting non-communicable diseases, priority should be given to approaches that are used in emergency cases where decisions can have life-saving character.\nApplicants invited to the second stage and envisaging to include clinical studies [1] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

Legal and financial set-up of the grants\nThis action is intended to be implemented in the form of an amendment of the grant agreement concluded pursuant to Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nFor the additional activities covered by this action:\nThe funding rate is 50% of the eligible costs. This is justified by the pooling of proposers' in-kind contributions and in-house activities and by the nature of activities to be performed: in addition of joint calls, sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical trial sites.\nBeneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP). The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. As a co-funded European Partnership, providing financial support to third parties is a core activity of this action in order to achieve its objectives. Consequently, the EUR 60 000 threshold laid down in Article 207 of Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 does not apply. The maximum amount of FSTP that may be awarded to any single third party for the duration of the partnership is set at EUR 3.00 million. This ceiling is justified by the fact that FSTP is a primary activity of this action, by its expected duration of 7-10 years (exceeding a standard project lifespan), and by the extensive experience gained under predecessor partnerships. This ceiling is also justified by the fact that the FSTP will support infectious diseases research involving multi-country research networks and infrastructures as well as their coordination. However, if the objectives of the action would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult (and duly justified in the proposal) the maximum amount may be higher.\nThe starting date of the grant awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the application. Applicants must justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their application. Costs incurred from the starting date of the action may be considered eligible (and will be reflected in the entry into force date of the amendment to the grant agreement).\nThe granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.\nLegal and financial set-up of the grants are described in\nAnnex G\nof the Work Programme General Annexes.",

          "scope": "This topic targets an action under Article 24(2) HE Regulation aiming to add additional activities to existing grant agreements, together with additional partners (if relevant) that would deliver on those activities. The award of a grant to continue the partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-12-01: “European Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness” and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant, such as the close coordination with the Clinical Trial Coordination Mechanism (CT-CM) [1] , should be subject to an evaluation. The partnership should be firmly anchored within the framework of the European Health Union package [2] and ensure synergies with the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and other relevant Commission services. The partnership’s activities are expected to be key enablers of the EU Global Health Strategy [3] . Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of the topic HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-12-01: “European Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness” and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present the additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions. The existing action, the “Be Ready Now - European Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness” (BE READY NOW) can only reasonably be enhanced and enlarged on the basis of the existing consortium [4] , as the co-funded framework established cannot simply be replaced without significant disruption, given the top-quality, long-term expertise and wide coverage of the beneficiaries comprising this consortium.\nThe partnership should contribute to the actions proposed in the Joint Communication on the European Preparedness Union Strategy (JOIN(2025) 130 final [5] ) which recognises the essential contribution of research and innovation to allow “continuously adapted, optimised and state-of-the-art responses to crisis”. It should also contribute to the “Strategy for European Life Sciences” [6] . Synergies with EU programmes such as EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [7] or the Digital Europe Programme [8] are encouraged.\nThe co-funded Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness should enable improved coordination and cooperation on national and European levels (and contributing globally), building on the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) [9] established in the first phase of the partnership. The partnership’s implementation is grounded in coordinating and jointly funding transnational research, combined with a strong focus on integrative ‘in-house’ activities, ultimately reinforcing the readiness of Europe’s research ecosystem. As a continuation of an existing action, the proposal should present the additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions.\nThe partnership should cover the full scope of preparedness research, ranging from basic and pre-clinical research, to clinical, public health, social sciences and implementation research. The partnership will consider the interplay between environmental, ecological and climatic factors and the emergence and spread of health threats and will adopt a One Health approach to better understand and mitigate the risks of emerging infectious diseases.\nOf particular interest is the consolidation and further development of the ever-warm clinical research network, comprising both observational and interventional studies, ensuring continuous clinical research activity across diverse sites, and with the in-built capacity to rapidly respond to public health emergencies. In this regard, the partnership should ensure that provisions are in place for the close coordination with the CT-CM, which i) should facilitate providing scientific advice on the clinical research needs in preparedness and response to public health emergencies, and ii) promote a coordinated approach to the national and EU funding of identified clinical research needs.\nThe partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research and capacity building, widening the engagement of countries not yet involved. As a demonstration of its added value, the partnership should be able to attract the engagement of a broad range of stakeholders beyond European health authorities and research funders, such as private and philanthropic actors and innovators.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [10] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nThe relevant European research infrastructures [11] in the area of health should be exploited for available services, expertise and digital tools for dataset creation, standardisation, data discovery, secure access, management, visualization, harmonization, analysis and other functions as appropriate.\nWhen defining calls for proposals in the context of jointly funded transnational research, the partnership should consider sex and identity-related differences. If relevant, it also needs to consider the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The support and involvement of citizens and civil society should be considered.\nThe partnership will consolidate a suitable health research data ecosystem aligned with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [12] , and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) [13] supporting the harmonisation and standardisation as well as the federated access of FAIR [14] research data in the context of pandemic preparedness and response.

          "scope": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a high burden for patients, caregivers, health systems and society. Given the limitations with current therapeutic solutions, including that they primarily address symptoms rather than underlying causes and can have serious side effects, together with the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases in an aging population, there is a huge need to develop more innovative, safer and more effective therapeutic solutions for these diseases. To further enhance their safety and effectiveness, the therapeutic solution based on an active substance should be combined/complemented with another multidisciplinary approach (e.g. lifestyle changes, cognitive training, rehabilitation therapies). Together this innovative intervention should lead to an improved quality of life and reduce the societal impact of these diseases.\nRare neurodegenerative diseases are excluded [2] .\nProposals should address most of the following aspects:\n• Perform rigorous early-stage [3] clinical trials into the safety and efficacy of the innovative interventions and their mode of administration, ensuring adequate cohorts/sample sizes with adequate representation of the patient population, including in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.\n• Through the clinical trials and to the extent possible of additional studies, gain further insight into the potentially novel mechanism(s) of action of the innovative therapies and complementary approaches. This could entail analyses of imaging (e.g. MRI, ultrasound, nuclear imaging), as well as physiological, molecular, biochemical or omics signatures revealing potential perturbations prior to the intervention and recovery/improvement thereafter, and it could lead to the development of surrogate endpoints. This insight should open the path to more personalised interventions and approaches.\n• Use and/or develop technologies, including digital ones (e.g. (generative) Artificial Intelligence - AI [4] , wearable technologies) to help implement and monitor the long-term efficacy of the intervention(s), as well as manage the disorder and/or monitor their progression (e.g. with unobtrusive technologies suitable for patient monitoring at home and in real-world conditions), whilst also ensuring they are bias-free, inclusive, and ethically sound.\n• Utilise existing data, biobanks, registries and/or cohorts, together with the generation of new data that should be managed in line with the FAIR principles.\n• Engage all relevant stakeholders (especially patients and patients’ representatives for the disease, caregivers, clinicians, counsellors, regulators, etc.) to design end-user optimised interventions, applying gender-sensitive and intersectional approaches.\n• Advance research by leveraging already existing and emerging state-of-the-art research infrastructures (e.g. EuroBioImaging [5] , European Genomic Data Infrastructure [6] , ECRIN [7] , EATRIS [8] , EBRAINS [9] , BBMRI [10] , etc.), as well as results stemming from EU-supported research projects, where applicable [11] .\n• Engage with national public health authorities and regulators to ensure a robust development pathway and further uptake of the intervention.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [12] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nFunded projects should liaise with the future co-funded European Partnership for Brain Health [13] (covered by topic HORIZON-HLTH-2025-02-DISEASE-01: “European Partnership for Brain Health”) once launched.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [14] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers are in possession of improved human-relevant New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) platforms that capture the genetic, phenotypic, age-related, immune, microbiome, and environmental exposure variability of the human population. These innovations support more equitable healthcare solutions and personalised treatment strategies across diverse life stages.\n• Industry gets access to platforms that allow a faster pace of innovation for the development of more cost-effective targeted therapeutic interventions and improvement of the safety assessment of chemicals, other medicinal products, and medical devices.\n• Patients benefit from innovative platforms and strategies that improve prediction, prevention and treatment of diseases, in particular through enhanced understanding of disease pathways and mechanisms.\n• The general population is better protected through a safer environment, as these platforms enhance the detection and mitigation of risks posed by chemicals and other potentially harmful substances.\n• Regulatory bodies gain confidence and trust in NAMs, supporting their integration into product development, risk assessment, and approval processes.\n• Fewer live animals are used in biomedical research and regulatory testing.",
          "scope": "This topic aims to support the ongoing paradigm shift in biomedical research and safety assessment of chemical compounds by fully integrating NAMs across the entire research and regulatory spectrum, from basic discovery phase to clinical application, and regulatory testing of medicinal products and medical devices, and/or industrial and environmental chemicals.\nNAMs include a wide range of innovative and human-relevant technologies such as in-vitro or human ex-vivo assays, organoids, Organ-on-Chip (OoC) systems, human tissue models, induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) applications, virtual twin tools, in-silico methods, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modelling.\nAlthough the Commission and several Member States have supported the development of NAMs for over two decades, primarily in the context of chemical risk assessment, regulatory uptake remains limited. There is a need to address this situation by delivering validated NAMs solutions that can be adopted by industry and accepted by the regulators for the safety assessment of chemicals. In parallel, there is a growing readiness to expand the development and application of NAMs across the entire biomedical research spectrum, from early discovery through to clinical translation and regulatory testing of medicinal products and medical devices.\nProposals should bring together stakeholders from academia, health-related infrastructures, SMEs [1] , industry, and regulators to develop new NAMs platforms or improve existing ones that could be used for biomedical applications and/or regulatory testing. For biomedical applications, these platforms should enhance disease modelling precision, especially in areas where current animal models are of limited human relevance, and where NAMs could effectively complement or replace animal studies. For proposals addressing regulatory use, in particular the safety assessment of chemicals, other medicinal products and medical devices, the intended context(s) of use should be clearly defined, with validation strategies and methodologies aligned with current OECD and/or European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance. Early, proactive, and sustained engagement with regulators should also be demonstrated.\nProposals should develop or optimise scalable and reproducible platforms based on one or more of the following:\n• Advanced in-vitro assays.\n• iPSC-based models, organoid or complex OoC systems derived from patients and/or healthy donors.\n• Human tissues that closely replicate physiological and pathological conditions.\nIn order to enable real-time monitoring of physiological responses, proposals should consider integration of embedded sensors. They should also address biological diversity, reflecting variations in genetics, phenotype, age, immune status, and microbiome across the population.\nMoreover, proposals may incorporate one or both of the following complementary approaches to enhance predictive power and clinical relevance:\n• AI-driven predictive modelling trained on high-quality, curated, bias-minimised datasets to predict outcomes of biomedical interventions, or risk assessment.\n• Virtual twin technology to simulate disease progression, responses to interventions, and support the optimisation of clinical trials.\nTo maximise scientific impact, interoperability, and reuse, all data generated should comply with FAIR [2] principles. Proposals should describe how data will be curated, standardised, and shared within or linked to the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [3] or other repositories, and/or relevant ESFRI [4] research infrastructures.\nIn order to optimise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all proposals selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities.\nProposals should consider involving the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), including its EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) [5] , to take advantage of its expertise and relevant activities in bridging research and application communities and facilitating uptake of NAMs in biomedical research and regulatory testing. In that respect, the JRC should collaborate with any successful proposal and this collaboration should be established after the proposal’s approval.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [6] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361\n[2] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this Work Programme part.\n[3] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[4] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[5] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/reference-and-measurement/european-union-reference-laboratories/eu-reference-laboratory-alternatives-animal-testing-eurl-ecvam_en\n[6] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

          "scope": "R&I is essential for economic growth and boosting the competitiveness of the EU's life sciences sector. Through the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe Framework Programmes, the EU has supported projects that significantly impact our health by fostering scientific discoveries and developing new solutions. Transformational health innovations, such as mRNA vaccines, highlight the importance of collaboration among businesses, research institutions, and healthcare providers. Furthermore, sustained funding throughout the entire value chain is crucial for maximising impact and ensuring more products reach patients faster. The main aim of this topic is to pilot a follow-on funding mechanism, supporting the stepwise development of biotech innovations through collaboration, resulting from previously supported EU R&I actions in the field of health. This topic contributes to strengthening the R&I ecosystem within the EU and supports the implementation of the “Strategy for European Life Sciences” [1] . Given the importance of biotechnology as a critical technology [2] , this topic aims to ensure that promising research results are efficiently taken further along the value chain, speeding the time to market or patient through stepwise funding and increasing the EU’s competitiveness. The chosen area of focus is regenerative medicine as it has the potential to heal or replace tissues and organs damaged by age, disease, or trauma, as well as to normalise congenital defects. Proposals should focus on prototyping, demonstrating and validating health innovations from TRL 5, moving beyond early-stage research to clinical development, testing, or eventual large-scale manufacturing. The previously funded EU research on which the proposal is build should be applicable to the field of regenerative medicine and should have clear exploitation potential and/or socio-economic benefits for the patients.\nApplicants are expected to:\n• Demonstrate in their proposal that the health product, therapy or service, has been successfully validated at preclinical level in the prior EU funded project and provide justification of the innovation potential with qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. publications, patent/trademark/design applications, spin-out/start-up track record, regulatory procedures, venture capital pitches, funds raised etc).\n• Justify the proposed composition of the consortium and explain how this differs from the previous grant, and demonstrate how the health product, therapy or service to be developed further qualifies as regenerative medicine.\n• Demonstrate adequate protection of the idea or Intellectual Property Rights or ensure freedom to operate until full deployment.\n• Have a clear vision on the intended pathway to patients and/or route to market, including regulatory compliance. This includes defining specific milestones together with concrete and verifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess progress towards the market or healthcare settings.\n• Identify the target patient group(s) (how many patients to be treated during the project and the potential patient population that could benefit) and product development milestones including a financial plan (for each milestone).\nIn the case of innovations with commercial potential, proposals should present the investor and market readiness towards commercialisation and deployment (market research, value proposition, business case and business model, prospects for growth, intellectual property protection, competitor analysis etc.) as well as aspects of regulation, certification and standardisation and reimbursement.\nIn the case of innovations with evidenced limited commercial potential but high patient benefit, proposals should contain a deployment and sustainability plan including aspects related to regulations, certification and standardisation and patient access through healthcare providers.\nProposals should take into account sex, gender, age and other relevant socio-demographic variables to ensure the scientific robustness, clinical value and applicability of the targeted regenerative medicine innovation.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [3] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/jobs-and-economy/towards-strategy-european-life-sciences_en ; https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1686\n[2] Commission Recommendation on critical technology areas for the EU's economic security for further risk assessment with Member States: https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-10/C_2023_6689_1_EN_annexe_acte_autonome_part1_v9.pdf\n[3] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

It also provides guidance to harmonise the awareness of NAMs for ethical committee members, reviewers, and regulators, based on best practices in the participating Member States. The programme should propose concrete actions to increase the confidence of regulators in NAMs including a better understanding of the potential and limitations of NAMs.",
          "scope": "This topic aims to coordinate and develop the new European Research Area (ERA) policy action to accelerate, through an aligned and coordinated approach across Member States and Associated Countries, the development, validation/qualification, acceptance, and uptake of NAMs in biomedical research and regulatory testing of medicinal products and medical devices as part of the ERA Policy Agenda 2025-2027 [2] .\nThe ERA action should establish an EU-wide forum that brings together relevant ministries, regulatory agencies, research funding organisations, academia, industry (pharmaceutical and medical technology), Contract Research Organisations (CROs), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [3] , and startups to harmonise policies and strategies for NAMs development and implementation.\nThe selected proposal should be coordinated by any active participant to the ERA action to ensure consistency with ERA action policy objectives. It should contribute to the implementation of the following themes of the four thematic Working Groups (WGs) of the ERA action:\nWG1: Development of NAMs and common European infrastructures. This WG identifies opportunities for the development and integration of NAMs and the establishment of supporting infrastructures. Its focus spans specific disease or biological areas and safety, quality, and efficacy assessment endpoints for medicinal products and medical devices. The WG provides insight and suggests priorities to governments and industry for the further coordinated efforts to leverage promising development of NAMs, taking into consideration the complementarity of scientific strengths, funding priorities and available expertise in the different Member States and regions.\nWG2: Validation, acceptance, and uptake of NAMs. The WG defines optimal criteria for NAMs to facilitate their uptake in the contexts of basic and applied biomedical research, and their acceptance for the regulatory assessment and eventual approval of medicinal products and medical devices within defined contexts of use. It proposes priorities for the validation and qualification of NAMs. Member States and pharma/MedTech industry take the decision to jointly support the validation/qualification of certain NAMs that are sufficiently mature for acceptance and uptake in regulatory testing of medicinal products and medical devices.\nWG3: Education and training. The WG maps existing education and training programmes on NAMs and the 3Rs principles and assesses their quality and outreach. The WG makes suggestions to Member States based on the best practices identified for the joint development of high-quality education and training modules on NAMs and the application of the 3Rs principles in close partnership with education directors at knowledge institutes.\nWG4: Openness and awareness. The WG develops common policies to improve the openness and quality of research, including open access to available protocols on NAMs, and facilitating the publication of results from NAMs and animal experiments, even if these are negative or neutral (or historic, if feasible and appropriate), to avoid unnecessary duplication of animal testing or development of non-valid NAMs. It considers strategies for sharing best practices to make sure that different ethical committees, funding assessment committees, reviewers, and regulators have a similar level of awareness regarding the latest scientific advancements in available NAMs. It proposes actions to enhance the confidence of regulators in validated and qualified NAMs. The WG also identifies opportunities for raising awareness among civil society and patients regarding the biomedical research, drug discovery and development process.\nThe European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) may contribute to the proposal selected for funding, particularly with activities on innovative in vitro biotechnologies.\n[1] Replacement, Reduction, Refinement: https://nc3rs.org.uk/who-we-are/3rs\n[2] Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the European Research Area Policy Agenda 2025-2027: https://european-research-area.ec.europa.eu/documents/proposal-council-recommendation-european-research-area-policy-agenda-2025-2027\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• In line with the objectives of the “Strategy for European Life Sciences” [1] , the EU successfully translates a strategic priority into an implementable action plan for building technological and innovation leadership on a global stage.\n• Europe, including regions, profits from an increased capacity, accessibility, coordination of its Advanced Therapies Medicinal Products (ATMP) infrastructures.\n• The European economy benefits from more ATMP innovations being developed and commercialised in the EU.\n• Patients across the EU gain faster access to innovative ATMPs thanks to increased and focused public Research and Development (R&D) investment, harmonised policies and strategies for ATMP development and uptake in healthcare systems.",
          "scope": "ATMPs represent a frontier in medicine, offering groundbreaking treatments such as gene therapies, cell therapies, and tissue-engineered products that hold the promise of addressing complex and previously untreatable conditions. The European ATMP landscape is dynamic and promising, with 28 products having received marketing authorisation and many more in the pipeline [2] . The development of specialised infrastructures in Europe for these cutting-edge therapies is crucial for fostering innovation and ensuring fast and efficient delivery to patients in an equitable way. The report by Mario Draghi [3] on EU competitiveness, highlights that the EU’s share of the fast-growing global ATMP market is small, suggesting that to remain competitive, increased and focused public R&D investment is needed to complement ongoing efforts to streamline regulations and ensure faster pricing and reimbursement. The report recommends building on existing innovation hubs and expanding the capacity of the EU to conduct ATMPs R&D by the consolidation of EU public funds. By strengthening this budding innovation ecosystem, Europe can position itself as a leader in the ATMP sector, ultimately improving patient access to life-saving treatments and stimulating economic growth.\nThe EU has several scattered ATMP centres with divergent capacities and capabilities [4] , limiting its attractiveness for scaling up R&D in the field, calling for a coherent and coordinated approach. The aim of this topic is to establish a European network of Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for ATMPs, building on existing centres and coordinating their further development in synergy with national strategies. The creation of such a Network is key for strengthening the EU’s capacity to develop, scale up and deploy ATMPs across Europe, increasing Europe’s attractiveness for clinical research in the field and supporting the implementation of the “Strategy for European Life Sciences”. The CoEs should directly support the development and manufacturing capacity of ATMP-related biotechnologies, such as cell and gene therapy platforms, manufacturing infrastructure, and scale-up processes.\nEach potential CoE should be an existing centre embedded within a vibrant biocluster (i.e. within proximity to pharmaceutical companies and research institutes) and should already benefit from critical infrastructure and services necessary to advance from lab to patient such as knowledge transfer support, state-of-the-art GMP [5] and clinical trials facilities. In addition, the centre should be performing the full spectrum of life sciences research, from discovery to clinical trials and should have demonstrated leadership in the field through a stand-alone research programme. Each CoE is expected to become world-class by further embedding itself in the full value chain and seeking additional political and financial support at regional, national and European level. The network should be limited to no more than 10 CoEs across the EU, with complementary expertise in the various ATMP technologies.\nThe proposed European network of CoEs for ATMPs should include multiple stakeholders beyond the research community and/or established academic centres, including Member State ministries, regional representatives, funders, regulators and healthcare payers, industry actors, patient organisations and policymakers. The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as a member of the consortium selected for funding, bringing its expertise in pre-normative research, standardisation, regulatory advice and access to its research infrastructure.\nTo align with STEP eligibility, activities supported under this topic should demonstrate how they contribute to either: i) bringing innovative, cutting-edge technologies with strong economic potential to the internal market, or ii) reducing or preventing the Union’s strategic dependencies in the field of advanced therapies.\nProposals should be of limited duration (2027-2030) and cover at a minimum the following activities:\n• Identify common needs and challenges related to ATMP R&D, as well as develop relevant policy recommendations related to clinical trials, manufacturing, logistics, regulatory (including harmonisation of market access authorisation and reimbursement procedures), public acceptance, policies for transnational care, and coordination with national/regional healthcare systems etc.\n• Develop a roadmap to ensure that Europe becomes the global leader for ATMP R&I by 2035, with clearly defined milestones, targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The roadmap should align with national R&D plans and include a long-term funding strategy. Appropriate measures should be considered to expand or widen the network during the roadmap’s implementation.\n• Create an advisory board with diverse stakeholders, as a forum to provide guidance and advice for ensuring maximum utility of the generated outputs.\n• Develop common education and training programmes for the next generation of scientists including outreach activities to better inform i) the public and patients on the benefits of ATMPs and ii) the stakeholders about access to the CoEs facilities and support.\nProposals should build on the experiences and outcomes of previous or ongoing actions such as RESTORE [6] , Join4ATMP [7] , PRECISEEU [8] and T2EVOLVE [9] , and liaise with the relevant partnerships such as the co-funded European Partnership on Rare Diseases [10] , the co-funded European Partnership for Personalised Medicine [11] and the Innovative Health Initiative Joint Undertaking (IHI-JU) [12] as appropriate.\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/jobs-and-economy/towards-strategy-european-life-sciences_en ; https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1686\n[2] Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) quarterly highlights and approved ATMPs Feb-May 2025: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/committee-report/cat-quarterly-highlights-approved-atmps-may-2025_en.pdf\n[3] The future of European competitiveness, Mario Draghi: https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en\n[4] Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products - EATRIS: https://eatris.eu/atmp\n[5] Good Manufacturing Practices: https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/eudralex/eudralex-volume-4_en\n[6] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/820292\n[7] https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101137206/program/43108390/details , https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101137206\n[8] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101161301\n[9] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/945393\n[10] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101156595 , https://erdera.org\n[11] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101137129 , https://www.eppermed.eu\n[12] http://www.ihi.europa.eu",

They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this topic.\nProposals should specify which segment of the patient population they target, the specific organisational and/or technological innovations to be procured, and why the proposed innovative solutions would be fit for purpose adhering, when relevant, to the principles of integrated care [4] or personalised medicine [5] .\nExamples of target groups that could be covered by this action are: patients at risk of vulnerability such as children and older/frail people with complex needs for health and social care; people with multi-morbidities or non-communicable diseases of high burden; people with both physical and mental health conditions; people living with rare diseases or cancer; persons with disabilities; other groups of patients in need of highly integrated and coordinated care. Proposals should pay attention to how gender and intersectional factors (e.g. caregiving responsibilities, work-related health disparities etc.) affect healthcare access and outcomes.\nProposals should demonstrate, with qualitative and quantitative indicators, how they contribute to the above expected outcomes, clearly describe the application of the principles of integrated care and personalised medicine in the deployed solutions, when relevant. This would also include embedding the innovation in the existing health systems, addressing gaps and avoiding overlaps, while fostering change management across organisations, professions and sectors.\nSolutions envisaged within this action are for example digital solutions [6] , including Artificial Intelligence (AI) elements, to facilitate delivery of integrated care across hospitals, primary care, Long-Term Care (LTC) facilities and home settings, or technologies that improve routine diagnosis and lead to personalised medicine approach with the health and care setting.\nThe actions should target first deployment of innovative solutions across different health and care jurisdictions in Europe by engaging public and/or private procurers from each participating country (at national, regional or local level) that have deployment responsibilities and budget control in the provision of health and care services. Procurers will specify, purchase and deploy solutions addressing their relevant and shared unmet needs, while engaging together in a supply and demand side dialogue. Proposals should be based on clearly identified user needs and well-structured deployment plans, explaining how the procurement of the innovative solutions will contribute to the expected outcomes and improve current practice. In addition, cost-effectiveness analyses as well as estimates of the wider economic impact are highly desirable.\nActivities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce national/regional policy frameworks and policies, to raise awareness, for technical assistance and/or capacity building beyond the project, to mainstream PPI implementation and remove obstacles to introduce innovative solutions to the market.\nA wide variety of settings are potentially relevant for the implementation of such innovative solutions, for example primary healthcare settings, hospitals, specialised centres, long-term care facilities and home settings. The involvement of end-users (including for analysing the impact of the deployed solutions on health professionals and patients across the care continuum) and the use of cross-sectorial approaches are necessary. When relevant, linkage with ongoing work at national level for the implementation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [7] is encouraged. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [8] in the health domain.\nTransfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to healthcare is possible. The topic is open both to innovations bringing improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to innovations delivering end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovative elements. Proposals are strongly encouraged to build upon past work and build synergies with ongoing EU-funded initiatives, for example the Joint Actions JADECARE [9] and Xt-EHR [10] , the project MyHealth@Myhands [11] and the three co-funded European Partnerships on Transforming Health and Care Systems [12] , on Personalised Medicine [13] and on Rare Diseases [14] , as well as with actions supported under the Technical Support Instrument and the Cohesion Policy Funds.\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/support-policy-making/shaping-eu-research-and-innovation-policy/new-european-innovation-agenda/innovation-procurement/horizon-europe-funding-pcp-and-ppi_en For PPI executed by a group of procurers, the lead procurer should coordinate the preparation and implementation of one joint or several coordinated public procurements of innovative solutions, based on common specifications defined jointly by the buyers’ group. Each PPI should focus on one concrete need identified as a common challenge that requires the deployment of innovative solutions. Projects that aim to implement a PPI should contain a preparation and execution stage.\n[2] European Pillar of Social Rights: https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/european-pillar-social-rights-20-principles_en\n[3] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361\n[4] https://integratedcarefoundation.org/nine-pillars-of-integrated-care See also diagram: https://cordis.europa.eu/docs/results/h2020/634/634288_PS/001-eur-selfie2020-infographic-implementation.png and relevant corresponding article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621000605?via%3Dihub\n[5] https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/personalised-medicine_en\n[6] For digital technologies concerned, appropriate measures for the security of the communications between the intended parties should be considered, in particular based on the use of post-quantum cryptography.\n[7] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[8] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[9] https://www.jadecare.eu\n[10] https://www.xt-ehr.eu\n[11] https://myhealthmyhands.eu\n[12] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095654 , https://www.thcspartnership.eu\n[13] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101137129 , https://www.eppermed.eu\n[14] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101156595 , https://erdera.org",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Healthcare providers and policymakers make use of evidence-based indicators and methodologies to identify low-value care [1] practices, as well as opportunities for improvement and tools to monitor such improvements.\n• Healthcare professionals are equipped with the knowledge and tools to implement guidelines for reducing or discontinuing low-value care activities and maintaining effective and patient-centred practices that ensure quality of care.\n• Patients and citizens benefit from more effective healthcare, by understanding and endorsing measures that reduce low-value care, recognising the potential to achieve higher-quality healthcare and better health outcomes overall.\n• Health and care systems benefit from a reduction of low-value care practices, which enables enhanced patient safety and quality of care, while contributing to their efficiency as well as fiscal and environmental sustainability.\n• Healthcare organisations can, by identifying low-value care practices, reallocate valuable healthcare resources to other areas of need.",
          "scope": "Low-value care, as defined in the footnote, can have widespread negative consequences for patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, the health and care system, and the broader environment. A 2017 OECD report [2] estimated that “wasteful healthcare spending is common” and that “up to one-fifth of healthcare spending could be redirected towards better uses”. Low-value care represents a significant challenge, contributing to waste, costs, misuse of resources, and inefficiencies. Addressing low-value care can free up and allow reallocation of valuable healthcare resources to other areas of need, thereby maximising health outcomes, improving health and care systems resilience, and reducing their environmental impact. In this context, a recent report [3] by the Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment (HSPA) [4] establishes the methodological basis and metrics to identify, measure and reduce low-value care.\nResearch activities under this topic should adopt a patient-centred approach that considers the needs and preferences of patients and citizens. They should promote socially acceptable solutions, taking into account relevant ethical, social and legal aspects and foster dialogue and collaboration between policymakers, healthcare providers, healthcare professionals, and patients/citizens. Proposals should engage citizens and civil society organisations in the development of their actions to ensure acceptability of solutions. By doing so the projects will contribute to better use of healthcare resources -including time and personnel- in ways that significantly improve patient outcomes and alleviate the increasing burden on healthcare professionals and health systems. Implementation research and multidisciplinary approaches should be considered to foster adoption and ensure effective interventions and long-term sustainability.\nProposed activities may [5] include clinical studies [6] to provide evidence on the value of any interventions or processes and, therefore, facilitate justified removal of any type of low value care. Proposed activities may also include data models, digital and artificial intelligence-based analysis, models and/or tools to identify and/or address low-value care. Proposed activities may examine the design and impact of healthcare payment systems, that could unintentionally incentivise low-value care and evaluate alternative financing models that better align incentives with patient outcomes and high-value care. Proposed activities may also facilitate or implement collaboration among registries (disease registries such as cancer registries, primary healthcare visits registries, prescription and drug purchase registries, reimbursement and medical devices registries, screening databases, socio-economic and census databases, etc.) across regions or countries, to enable or improve the assessment and comparison of different levels of care and their value to patients. Additionally, activities that facilitate learning and best practice transfers between countries or regions may also be considered as element of the proposal (for instance, to leverage best practice-sharing initiatives from international platforms such as the Knowledge Hub of the co-funded European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems [7] or any other relevant European or global initiatives). Additionally, proposals may include or support international comparisons of low-value care practices and strategies for their reduction across countries, if and where deemed valuable.\nResearch actions should address all the following objectives:\n• Develop a deeper understanding of how low-value care can be identified and measured throughout the healthcare process, including testing related indicators and producing evidence-based methodologies that enable the pursuit of improved efficiency and quality of care.\n• Identify instances of overuse, misuse, underuse and unwarranted variation in specific healthcare contexts across different stages of the healthcare process. This analysis should provide actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers and healthcare professionals to evaluate the potential of possible strategies for reducing low-value care, allowing for more informed decision-making and improved care practices.\n• Develop and/or pilot innovative strategies for effective reduction of low-value care in specific settings across the care pathway. These pilots should demonstrate scalability and transferability across diverse health and care systems in Europe.\nProposals should consider how gender norms and roles influence utilisation patterns, ensuring that strategies to reduce low-value care do not inadvertently exacerbate existing gender and social inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes. In addition, attention should be paid to intersectional factors that may further affect healthcare access and outcomes. If handling data and indicators, sex- and gender-disaggregated data should be collected and analysed, incorporating intersectional factors where feasible.\nProposals should consider the work and output of any EU level initiatives (e.g. the Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment, the co-funded European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems, relevant projects or Joint Actions funded under the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [8] and under EU Research & Innovation Framework Programmes, etc.) or other international initiatives (e.g. the 2017 OECD report mentioned above) in this area.\nApplicants envisaging [5] to include clinical studies [6] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] Definition of low-value care from the Report by the Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment: “From a health system perspective, low-value care encompasses overuse, misuse and underuse of healthcare services (for example, prevention, diagnostics, treatment, medication). Overuse and/or misuse comprise the delivery of harmful, ineffective, inappropriate, or not cost-effective healthcare services. Underuse refers to healthcare services not provided or used despite being necessary. Low-value care can lead to negative consequences for patients, their caregivers, the healthcare workforce, the health system as a whole and the wider environment.”\n[2] OECD (2017), Tackling Wasteful Spending on Health, OECD Publishing, Paris. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264266414-en\n[3] Report by the Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment: “Identifying, Measuring And Reducing Low-Value Care In The Context Of Health System Performance Assessment”. https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/identifying-measuring-and-reducing-low-value-care-context-health-system-performance-assessment_en\n[4] https://health.ec.europa.eu/health-systems-performance-assessment_en\n[5] Some proposals may not need to conduct clinical studies to achieve the objectives.\n[6] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.\n[7] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095654 , https://www.thcspartnership.eu\n[8] https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/eu4health_en\n[9] Some proposals may not need to conduct clinical studies to achieve the objectives.\n[10] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Patients benefit from decreased incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) caused by the administration of multiple medications (three or more medicinal products [1] ) and enhanced health outcomes by ensuring safer and more effective use of medication.\n• Healthcare professionals can adopt adverse drug reactions prevention and reduction strategies to integrate genetic and other biomarker information into clinical decision-making to optimise the use of medication, especially in situations of comorbidities.\n• Healthcare systems benefit from cost savings thanks to reduced hospital admissions and other costs associated with ADRs related to the intake of multiple medicines.\n• Clinical and regulatory guidelines and policies for medication management in case of multiple medications can be revised supported by robust evidence.\n• Educational programs for healthcare providers and patients benefit from improved awareness and management of polypharmacy and ADRs.",
          "scope": "While medicinal products contribute considerably to the health of EU citizens, they can also have adverse reactions. It is estimated that around 5% of all hospital deaths are due to an adverse drug reaction. On average, 16% of hospitalised older [2] patients experience significant ADRs, varying in severity and mostly preventable, with commonly prescribed drug classes (such as diuretics, anti-bacterials, antithrombotic agents, analgesics, antineoplastics, etc.) accounting for most ADRs [3] . Overall, ADRs increase morbidity, mortality, hospitalisations, and healthcare costs.\nADRs from multiple medications contribute significantly to healthcare costs due to increased hospitalisations and treatments, making this an area of focus to achieve cost efficiency.\nInitial failure to recognise ADRs can generate inappropriate prescription cascades, in which the side effects of drugs are misdiagnosed as symptoms of new problems, resulting in further prescriptions and further side effects that tend to accumulate, confusing and complicating the diagnostic while aggravating the evolution. Therefore, there is a distinct need for research to help identify and prevent such prescription cascades, possibly by maximising the use of technology, as well as to improve multiple drug management in order to reduce patient harm. Furthermore, it is also possible that aside from the ADRs specific to individual drugs taken in combination, new ADRs can emerge as results from the drug combinations themselves.\nResearch activities under this topic should make use of the constantly improving health technologies and data analytics that provide new opportunities to address these issues more effectively, by better integrating medication management into healthcare practices, including into Electronic Health Records (EHR) and decision support systems.\nIdentifying and validating relevant biomarkers for better patient stratification can contribute to significantly decreasing the risk of adverse drug reactions. Biomarkers can also help to detect adverse drug reactions early before occurrence of clinical symptoms and enable early countermeasures. Generating knowledge on the interaction and complexity of biochemical pathways can improve the understanding of patients' response to ADRs and thus provide better tailored treatments and early responses to adverse reactions.\nFor this purpose, any biomedical strategy that allows a better stratification of patients to identify drug response patterns in well-defined patient groups could be used, including in-vitro or in-silico models for adverse drug reactions, imaging biomarkers, drug-drug/drug-gene/drug-food interactions, therapeutic dose reduction and pharmaco-exposomics, nutrition and beverage interference, smoking, vaping, pollution etc. De-escalation studies in view of improving multiple drug management can be also considered. Proposals should be sufficiently robust to examine differences across various populations, and also consider sex difference in drug reactions.\nThe further use of results generated by the projects funded under this topic should be ensured through data sharing with the relevant stakeholders and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), in view of possible adoption of deprescribing or adjusted-prescribing guidelines by relevant authorities at EU and national levels.\nWhere applicable, applicants are strongly encouraged to follow all relevant guidelines in the relevant scientific fields, including but not limited to:\n• Joint EMA/Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA)/EC Workshop recommendations on pharmacogenomics in medicines regulation and on implementation into clinical practice [4] .\n• Pharmaceutical development of medicines for use in the older population, Scientific guideline from the EMA [5] .\n• Guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (‘CPIC guidelines’) [6] .\nProposals funded under this topic should address all the following aspects:\n• Leverage the role of pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in predicting and preventing adverse drug reactions in situations of multiple medications (three or more drugs administered concomitantly), and propose personalised medicine approaches, such as targeted therapies and biomarker-driven treatment strategies, to reduce the rate of adverse drug reactions and limit multiple medications.\n• Maximise the use of technology, such as electronic health records, artificial intelligence and clinical decision support systems, to support safe medication use and prevent adverse drug reactions.\n• Address the ethical, regulatory, and implementation challenges associated with integrating personalised medicine into clinical practice to address adverse drug reactions due to the administration of multiple medications.\n• Generate evidence on the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of treatment guided by pharmacogenomics and other relevant biomarkers-based approach, for single drugs and for combinations of drugs.\n• Develop and implement strategies, including regulatory science approaches, for efficient integration of project results into daily healthcare.\n• Align with similar work in other EU-funded projects or partnerships, such as the co-funded European Partnership for Personalised Medicine [7] , the co-funded European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care System [8] etc. while avoiding any potential overlaps.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [9] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [10] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:\n• Citizens, patients, public authorities, social care services, healthcare practitioners and policymakers have a better understanding of the climatic health risks and determinants of disease and are better equipped to address health outcomes through enhanced and inclusive prevention, resilience, adaptation, preparedness and response, including better diagnosis and treatment.\n• Governments, public health authorities, researchers and civil society organisations are supported to tackle societal challenges linked to the health impacts of climatic factors.\n• Public authorities, organisations and the research community can rely on data collection and sharing according to FAIR [1] principles and leveraging of data availability and quality.\n• Policymakers and public authorities develop evidence-based climate change and health policies and interventions that are nature positive, inclusive and responsive to diverse population needs.",
          "scope": "The climate crisis poses an existential challenge to planetary and human health with larger effects on populations, groups and regions in a vulnerable situation. Climate change increases the incidence of non-communicable diseases and the prevalence of mental health conditions and facilitates the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Climate change can act as a risk multiplier and exacerbates existing health conditions and vulnerabilities.\nApplicants should explicitly state in their proposal which of the following broad focus areas is targeted and the proposed work should address only this specific broad focus area:\n• Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and/or individual safety (e.g. injuries or fatalities), excluding mental health aspects: proposals should explore evidence on the complex interactions between climate change (e.g. changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events) and NCDs and individual safety, which often involve multiple climate exposure pathways and compound and cascading climatic events.\n• Mental health, considering interactions with brain health if relevant: in the broad focus area of mental health and psychosocial well-being, proposals should increase the evidence on the acute and long-term impacts of climate change and the understanding of new syndromes related to climate stress.\n• Infectious diseases, including vector-borne and non-vector-borne: proposals should increase the understanding of the factors driving climate-related burden from infectious diseases.\nIn general, proposals should develop approaches to prevent and reduce the impacts of climate factors in the studied health outcomes and increase population and workforce resilience. A One Health approach should also be applied where relevant.\nMore specifically, research actions under this topic should include several of the following activities, depending on the relevance of each group of activities to the broad focus area targeted in the proposal:\n• Increase the understanding of correlations, causal pathways and mechanistic effects between climate change and disease/health outcomes, developing unified and standard methodologies and metrics to assess short- and long-term positive and negative impacts of climate change with an adequate level of granularity. Consider individual and/or cascading climatic events and exposure patterns, and risks and drivers of vulnerability and inequality.\n• Develop longitudinal studies to better ascertain differential effects of climatic stressors on health including multiple scales of impacts, ranging from the molecular level to population health outcomes. Consider variability across populations, generations and life phases, regions and occupations, and collect real-world exposure and health data in living and occupational settings, considering the use of emerging ecosystems such as the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [2] and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) [3] .\n• Study differential acute and long-term health impacts of climate (including a wide range of factors and cumulative effects) on vulnerable, sensitive or exposed population groups. Consider also differences in geographical vulnerabilities including, when relevant, geographical settings outside of urban areas, in overseas regions and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [4] . Understand the role of inequalities and societal vulnerability in determining climate-related health impacts and adaptive capacity.\n• Advance the knowledge on the climate, ecological and environmental drivers of pathogen abundance, including mechanisms and determinants of distribution, life-cycle patterns, transmission, virulence and survival. Consider climate change drivers of disease severity. Study host/pathogen and vector/host interactions clarifying the role of secondary reservoir hosts such as sylvatic, wildlife and livestock in the maintenance of pathogen life cycle. Assess the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and impact of control measures.\n• Explore the role of climate-driven human and wildlife mobility (e.g. bird migration patterns, human migration) in enhancing the global spread of pathogens and creating opportunities for their local establishment. Collect better field data and develop tools for disease modelling, risk and scenario projections that encourage interoperable data systems and cross border collaboration.\n• Increase the availability, accessibility, quality and standardisation of diagnostic testing for early diagnosis of infections and determining immune responses and vaccine efficacy. Increase the capacity for pathogen subtyping, and genomic surveillance for early warning and investigations of climate-related outbreaks. Develop rapid, portable, and affordable standardised diagnostic tools that can withstand climate extremes.\n• Increase the understanding of the factors that strengthen health resilience to climate change at the individual, local and societal levels. Investigate the role of individual mechanisms, community resilience and local solutions in mitigating the health impacts of climate change and related environmental degradation.\nInternational cooperation, in particular with LMICs, is strongly encouraged.\nIn order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all proposals selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities. Guidance on the potential activities to be developed can be obtained by consulting the clusters of projects ongoing under the Environment, Climate and Health research portfolio [5] .\nProposals should make sure that relevant activities, outcomes and outputs are shared with the European Climate and Health Observatory [6] through the cluster that will be formed after the approval of the proposals. Actions’ results should also contribute to future European Climate Risk Assessments. When relevant proposals should build on the outcomes of the projects that are part of the European Climate-Health Cluster [7] .\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [8] in the environment, climate and health domain.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [9] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this Work Programme part.\n[2] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en\n[4] As defined by the World Bank, https://www.worldbank.org\n[5] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/health/environment-climate-and-health_en\n[6] https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory\n[7] https://climate-health.eu\n[8] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[9] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:\n• The healthcare sector is supported with new technological developments and frameworks for greening, decarbonising and adapting to climate change, thus also contributing to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n• Governments, public health authorities, healthcare providers and practitioners, social care services and civil society have access to the best available evidence on the health costs and benefits (including co-benefits) of climate adaptation and mitigation actions and interventions.\n• Policymakers and public authorities develop environment, climate change and health policies and interventions based on robust frameworks and incorporating innovative, inclusive and accessible solutions and technologies.\n• Governments and public health authorities are supported in their adoption of robust frameworks and interventions to tackle societal challenges linked to the health impacts of climatic and environmental factors.\n• Populations are empowered and equipped with knowledge, tools and resources to adopt health-protective behaviours and adapt to health-related climate risks.",
          "scope": "The health sector accounts for nearly 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and generates significant demands for energy and materials, as well as dangerous polluting streams. Proactive mitigation efforts in the health sector can significantly reduce GHG emissions and pollution, saving many lives and contributing to relieve pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, specific mechanisms for emission reductions in the health sector remain less defined compared to those in other sectors.\nAt the same time, the climate crisis subjects healthcare systems to unprecedented pressures (e.g. on infrastructure, workforce, overall systems) while simultaneously having to respond to increasing healthcare needs. To reduce pressure in healthcare systems and generally improve public health, it is crucial to design inclusive and accessible interventions that prevent the health impacts of climate change and related environmental degradation, increase resilience and preparedness of individuals and communities and foster the adoption of health-protective behaviours.\nResearch activities under this topic should generate evidence on the opportunities and health co-benefits of mitigation in the health sector as well as foster the development of low-carbon medical technologies and digital solutions for the sector. Proposals should also support the design of effective, scalable, cost-effective and transferable interventions and frameworks that can be applied across a wide range of healthcare settings and/or in population, community and societal contexts and involving, when relevant, public and patient engagement. Proposals can consider both living and working environments.\nMore specifically research actions under this topic should include some of the following activities:\n• Develop and/or pilot effective, inclusive, accessible and impactful interventions to address the impact of climate change in healthcare systems and/or in health outcomes across populations, sectors and regions. These interventions should aim at reducing health vulnerability and building health resilience. Consider where relevant the involvement of local communities and/or end users in the development of these interventions.\n• Develop methodologies and analytical tools to assess the effectiveness and cost-benefit of health-related climate change adaptation interventions.\n• Generate evidence on the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation and propose frameworks to quantify the magnitude of their impacts.\n• Develop harmonised frameworks, assessment metrics and reporting methods to evaluate alternative mitigation strategies and interventions, as well as harmonised methodologies to assess the cost-benefit of different mitigation measures.\n• Explore and estimate the impact of preventive healthcare and lifestyle practices for mitigating the impacts of climate change in the health sector and increasing the resilience and preparedness of communities.\n• Propose best practices to enhance the climate resilience of healthcare infrastructures, healthcare professionals and relevant supply chains and logistics.\n• Explore and assess the role of primary care in increasing the preparedness of communities and reduce the health impacts of climate change.\n• Develop low-carbon medical technologies (including medical devices) and digital solutions to reduce the emissions of GHG and pollutants (to air, water and soil) of healthcare practices and their supply chains. Health technology assessment activities to evaluate new or alternative low carbon medical solutions may be included where appropriate.\nFunded projects under this topic should consider the scalability and transferability of the developed solutions to ensure that any knowledge, frameworks, methodologies, pilots, etc., developed are actionable and applicable across different healthcare settings and community contexts. Proposals should also consider the use of implementation science approaches to support the relevance and broad applicability of the research outcomes. Proposals should take into consideration the broader socio-economic challenges faced by healthcare systems (e.g. funding challenges, workforce shortages, population ageing and increase of chronic diseases). Additionally, solutions and interventions proposed under this topic should consider the Do No Significant Harm principle.\nIn order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all proposals selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities.

          "scope": "Climate-related health challenges are global and complex in nature, which calls for coordinated action bringing together different research disciplines, policy sectors, perspectives and approaches. This requires seamless communication and synergies between different Research and Innovation (R&I) funding instruments.\nR&I is key to increasing our understanding of existing and emerging climate-related vulnerabilities experienced by populations and health systems alike, as well as to supporting the development and implementation of effective and sustainable interventions for prevention, adaptation and preparedness against climate-related health threats. They also play a crucial role in supporting the health sector’s transition towards decarbonisation and long-term sustainability while ensuring that quality of care is maintained or improved.\nR&I funding schemes and programmes will structure and accelerate the health response needed to meet the severity of the climate crisis in the decades to come. Achieving this requires building on a truly collaborative and impactful network of key players that optimally and efficiently structure and align their research programmes and funding streams.\nThe Commission, in collaboration with other funders and international organisations, will work on the development of a collaborative interface that brings together research funders from around the world working at the intersection of health and climate. This platform will establish opportunities for participating organisations to discuss challenges and priorities and share best practices, research strategies and implementation plans. The platform will also serve to identify areas of common interest for collaboration and to build a shared vision to support health and climate research globally.\nProposals under this topic should focus on the provision of administrative and technical support to the successful establishment and implementation of a multilateral initiative of research and innovation funders working in climate change and health.\nMore specifically, proposals are expected to focus on all the following activities:\n• Build on the preparatory work done and further support exchanges between relevant parties to delineate the operational structure and governance model of the multilateral initiative, in close collaboration with the European Commission.\n• Facilitate and support the drafting of the workplan for the first period of activities of the multilateral initiative.\n• Provide administrative and organisational support to the board of the multilateral initiative, in close collaboration with the chairs of the initiative.\n• Provide scientific and technical support in aspects relevant to the development and implementation of the multilateral initiative.\n• Facilitate communication between members of the initiative as well as with external stakeholders and organisations, and support the organisation of necessary meetings and the preparation of supporting material.\n• Support external communication activities such as the creation of a website, newsletters, social media outreach and any other relevant communication and dissemination materials to promote the multilateral initiative.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers, policymakers, healthcare practitioners and the public have a more comprehensive understanding of the human exposome and the interactions between climatic, environmental and socio-behavioural factors, supported by FAIR [1] data linking these exposures to disease and health outcomes.\n• Researchers, governments, policymakers, social care services and healthcare practitioners have improved knowledge on the links between the climatic, social, lifestyle and environmental factors of the exposome and global health burden, supporting their efforts to adopt the exposome approach to identify and address relevant health impacts.\n• The public has access to the latest information on the influence of global environmental exposures on health, enabling the adoption of health-promoting, climate-resilient and nature-positive behaviours.",
          "scope": "The exposome is the totality of exposures (and their interactions) experienced by an individual throughout their lifetime, including chemical, physical, biological, nutritional and psychosocial factors, from conception onwards. Many of these factors originate in the environment, including climate-related exposures such as extreme heat, heightened air pollution or drought. Climate change may amplify or interact synergistically with other better-established exposures, dynamically altering the human exposome and its health implications. Despite this, climate factors remain underrepresented in large-scale human exposome studies.\nResearch activities under this topic should strengthen the use of the exposome approach to study global exposures and generate evidence on their health implications. Proposals should focus on integrating climate-related factors into exposome research and understanding how the exposome changes in response to direct and indirect climate exposures. Moreover, research activities should be multiscale and multidisciplinary and account for the complexity and multifactorial nature of health determinants and the most pressing unmet medical needs in relation to environmental degradation and disrupted ecosystems. Proposals should include climate-relevant social determinants of health as part of their proposed activities.\nMore specifically, research actions under this topic should include all the following activities:\n• Incorporate multiple climate exposures into exposomics studies and provide insights on their influence on disease burden, through interactions with other exposome factors.\n• Predict, identify and monitor changes in the exposome (including environmental, social and occupational exposures) resulting from climate-related pressures and study their health implications to identify emerging health risks and potential benefits of climate change.\n• Advance data generation, analysis, integration and interpretation in human exposomics, developing methodologies and integrating novel approaches (e.g. AI technologies and machine learning) for advanced data analytics, including for Real-World Data (RWD) [2] .\nIn addition, research actions should include several of the following targeted activities:\n• Establish and investigate the biological pathways and mechanisms by which the exposome drives health impacts, jointly considering climate-related and other exposures. Build upon (when relevant) and study existing and/or newly generated longitudinal cohorts that combine individual exposome data with the corresponding medical, omics and biological data.\n• Identify exposome-relevant indicators and biomarkers for exposome-related health risks and potential benefits using comprehensive exposome studies that combine climate, environmental, behavioural and social exposures. Account for disparities in individual trajectories and exposure patterns where relevant.\n• Report on health-relevant exposome findings using, where possible, standardised metrics to ensure harmonised reporting of exposome-driven disease burden across regions and sectors. Build on existing exposome toolboxes and increase their robustness and coverage by integrating climate related exposures.\n• Study the role of socioeconomic (e.g. income, energy poverty, occupation), demographic (e.g. gender, racial or ethnic origin [3] , age) and behavioural (e.g. public trust, risk perception) factors in determining patterns of exposure, using the exposome approach to generate knowledge on intersectional vulnerability and resilience to exposome-driven (including climate-driven) health impacts. Identify disproportionately affected populations and develop interventions to reduce disparities.\nWhen handling vulnerability data and indicators, sex-, gender-, racial or ethnic origin [3] -disaggregated data should be collected and analysed, incorporating intersectional factors where feasible and relevant.\nInternational cooperation is encouraged, in particular with regions that are under-represented in human exposome research.\nProjects should leverage the knowledge, data and tools already generated under past initiatives such as EHEN [5] and ongoing initiatives such as IHEN [6] , ICOS ERIC [7] and EIRENE RI [8] .\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [9] in the environment, climate and health domain. Projects should make the tools developed as part of their research available on the IHEN Exposome Toolbox [10] and upload their data sets in the IHEN Data Catalogue [11] .\nIn order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all proposals selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities. Guidance on the potential activities to be developed can be obtained by consulting the ongoing clusters of projects under the Environment, Climate and Health research portfolio [12] .\nProposals should make sure that relevant activities, outcomes and outputs are shared with the European Climate and Health Observatory [13] through the cluster that will be formed after the approval of the proposals.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [14] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this Work Programme part.\n[2] EMA definition: “Real-World Data are routinely collected data relating to patient health status or the delivery of healthcare from a variety of sources other than traditional clinical trials (e.g. claims databases, hospital data, electronic health records, registries, mhealth data, etc.)”.\n[3] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[4] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[5] https://www.humanexposome.eu\n[6] https://humanexposome.net\n[7] https://www.icos-cp.eu/about/organisation-governance/icos-eric\n[8] https://eirene.eu\n[9] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[10] https://bio.tools/t?domain=exposome\n[11] https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue\n[12] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/health/environment-climate-and-health_en\n[13] https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory\n[14] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

However, many of the urgently needed technologies, tools, systems and solutions are still at an early developmental stage, relying on further support for development and testing. Proposals under this topic are expected to close this gap and build on innovations being developed in the field, supported through, among others, EU Research and Innovation (R&I) funding. In this context, Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) projects can drive innovation and speed up the development of technologies for health adaptation to climate change by supporting the research and development of solutions to increase the resilience and preparedness of healthcare systems, communities and individuals against climate change. By focusing on early-stage solutions, PCP fosters collaboration between public sector buyers (e.g. public authorities, local authorities, health organisations) and private developers to create climate adaptation technologies, systems and solutions in the context of human health. These solutions will accelerate the transition to more climate-resilient healthcare systems and societies.\nPCP actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to jointly procure the development of innovative solutions for supporting adaptation efforts. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform Research and Development (R&D). They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this topic.\nProposals under this topic should support the development of innovative solutions, tools and models to enhance surveillance, prediction, prevention, risk management and diagnosis (e.g. testing), supporting the adaptation, resilience, and preparedness of healthcare systems and populations to climatic and climate-related environmental health risks.\nMore specifically proposals can support any of the areas listed below:\n• Geospatial technologies and decision-support frameworks that help local authorities and healthcare providers track at “high resolution” and better manage direct and indirect health risks related to climate change.\n• Real-time risk surveillance and early-warning technologies and monitoring tools that provide critical information for timely decision-making and responses related to the health risks of climate change.\n• Technologies and solutions that facilitate the transition to climate-resilient healthcare facilities and services. Activities targeting the general infrastructure (e.g. ventilation, construction or refurbishment) are out of scope.\n• Technologies, tools, procedures and solutions for health risk management, prevention and resilience, enhancing strategies and interventions for health adaptation to climate change in communities and occupational settings.\n• Innovative tools reducing risk and exposure to climate related environmental factors that exacerbate health risks.\nThis topic considers tools and technologies that could be developed and tested to support adaptation at both the community and healthcare system levels [1] . This approach would comprehensively address the needs of health authorities and those of local authorities and public organisations involved in risk management. Consortium composition could include diverse stakeholders such as hospitals, primary healthcare providers, domestic care services, municipalities, civil protection entities and government agencies. The focus can extend beyond climate variables to include other related environmental and ecological factors (for example air pollution) that interact with climate change and impact public health.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [2] in the environment, climate and health domain.\nContinuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users should be considered in the proposal.\nInvolvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by healthcare systems and/or local authorities and public organisations increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to purchase at least one solution resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will i) procure the solution(s) as part of the PCP or ii) in a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP. In the first case, procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP (see section H of the General Annexes of this Work Programme for further details) and foresee the budget to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase successful solution(s) after the PCP.\nThis topic is co-financed by the EU Mission on Adaptation to climate change [3] and supports the follow up to the 2023 Communication on the Missions [4] . Projects are encouraged to channel their activities through the Mission Implementation Platform [5] and the Mission’s Community of Practice [6] .\n[1] For digital technologies concerned, appropriate measures for the security of the communications between the intended parties should be considered, in particular based on the use of post-quantum cryptography.\n[2] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/adaptation-climate-change_en\n[4] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52023DC0457&qid=1693304388860\n[5] Initially established by MIP4Adapt ( https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/the-mission/about-mip4adapt , https://fedarene.org/project/mip4adapt ) and extended under the contract CINEA/2025/OP/0014.\n[6] https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/community-of-practice",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:\n• Policymakers and regulators will get accelerated access to improved evidence driven methodologies to evaluate the impact and efficiency of novel health technologies, facilitating decision-making for their use in humans and uptake in clinical practice.\n• Patients and the health systems will benefit from the more targeted and efficient uptake of safe and effective health innovations in clinical practice, supporting more personalised approaches and improved care and public health.",
          "scope": "The development, uptake and impact of health technologies typically results from a long product development process that is based on a 'life cycle approach' which typically involves several iterations of defined stages, i.e. from development, assessment to post-market surveillance and post-market clinical follow-up.\nWhile health technologies are governed by comprehensive legal frameworks aiming to ensure that health technologies are safe and effective, the regulatory science underlying these legal frameworks needs to be updated. This concerns inter alia i) more precise delineation of specific requirements (e.g. closing existing gaps concerning sufficiency of clinical evidence) and ii) the consideration of novel biomedical approaches, data and digital solutions (e.g. artificial intelligence - AI, virtual human twin, new approach methodologies as well as methods that cut through these domains) which model and predict relevant biological parameters and exploit relevant end-points and novel (bio)markers for clinical diagnostic and prognostic predictions. Such update of the regulatory science of health technologies should aim at supporting an effective adoption and uptake into routine use by health systems and end-users (healthcare providers, citizens), while maintaining guardrails to ensure that innovative health technologies are backed up by evidence of sufficient quality and relevance to the human situation.\nProposals can cover all types of health technologies, aiming to define improved and novel sources of evidence with proven relevance for regulatory decision-making with a focus on safety and performance throughout their lifecycle, i.e. throughout the continuous process of clinical evaluation. To this end, proposals should address either, or a combination of the following: i) the improvement of existing methodologies and their fitness to specific types or classes of health technologies, including methodology for regulatory assessment and ii) explore and examine to which extent novel information sources as indicated above can be considered as evidence that is satisfactory in view of regulatory needs concerning safety and performance.\nProposals should support the update and refinement of regulatory science on health technologies and contribute actionable information that can be used for improved or novel regulatory policies, rules, guidance documents and other tools with a view to ensuring that European patients and healthcare professionals have access to safe and effective innovative health technologies. Proposals should ultimately contribute to a regulatory environment that makes use of the full spectrum of novel biomedical and bio-digital approaches for clinical investigation and evaluation, while promoting a patient-centred approach to health technology innovation, facilitating the timely entry to market of performant and effective innovations and support their uptake in the health systems and clinical workflows without compromising patient safety.\nApplicant consortia should reflect a broad representation of stakeholders, notably clinical societies, academia, notified bodies, industry, patients and regulators and the proposed work should address one or more of the following elements:\n• Data and analyses on how existing approaches in regulatory science can be refined and improved in view of closing existing gaps of clarity, sufficiency of clinical evidence, generated on the basis of clinical studies and clinical investigations.\n• Data and analyses on whether and to which extent novel information sources from biomedicine including new approach methods and digital and AI-enabled models and approaches can contribute to the clinical evaluation of innovative health technologies, e.g.: By providing information on relevant biophysical, anatomical, physiological and other disease-relevant aspects. By supporting information integration through the use and aggregation of already existing data, including clinical ones, from similar types or groups of technologies (e.g. retrospective information in registries, data collections, including Real-World Data (RWD) [1] from using technologies that have characteristics that are relevant for innovative technologies). By supporting improved planning and design of first-in-man clinical studies, with a view of enhancing the effectiveness and the safety of such studies and rationalising the use of resources of all involved actors by focusing the generation and assessment of clinical data on health technologies for which those data are indispensable.\n• Data and analyses that examine to which extent the above-mentioned points can support the development and uptake of innovative technologies for unmet medical needs and for special patient populations (e.g. paediatric and rare conditions) via dedicated regulatory pathways and/or within a structured framework enabling their development and testing in a real-world environment under regulatory supervision (“regulatory sandbox”).\nThe actual conduct of clinical studies [2] is not in scope of this topic.\nThe activities should cover and draw on all the relevant healthcare innovation related frameworks other than pharmaceutical products, i.e. medical devices, in-vitro diagnostics, AI, and Substances of Human Origin (SoHO).\nThe starting point is a good understanding of the innovative technology and of its inherent risks, so that appropriate safety and quality requirements can be applied for monitoring the outcome in the relevant healthcare setting. As the number of hybrid or combinations of health technologies increases and technology integration becomes rather the norm than an exception in health innovation, the current segregated, technology-specific, frameworks may not provide a clear path forward for the health technology that is targeted. To that end, when considering an innovation, it is important to consider all relevant legislative frameworks including MDR [3] and IVDR [4] , the proposed SoHO-Regulation [5] , and AI Act [6] among others.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures especially those active in the health domain, such as EATRIS ERIC [7] , and also the findings of previous EU-projects (e.g.: CORE-MD [8] ).\n[1] EMA definition: “Real-World Data are routinely collected data relating to patient health status or the delivery of healthcare from a variety of sources other than traditional clinical trials (e.g. claims databases, hospital data, electronic health records, registries, mhealth data, etc.)”.\n[2] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.\n[3] Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2024/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 on standards of quality and safety for substances of human origin intended for human application: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1938/oj\n[6] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai , https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n[7] European Infrastructure for Translational Medicine: https://www.eatris.eu\n[8] Improved methods for clinical investigation and evaluation of high-risk medical devices: https://www.core-md.eu",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Biopharmaceutical industries get access to streamlined development and production processes for peptide- or protein-based biologicals.\n• Health systems benefit from the availability of enhanced or decentralised production systems for innovative health technologies that involve peptides or proteins, and which improve health and care.\n• Citizens and patients will benefit from better access, availability and affordability of pharmaceuticals based on biologicals.",
          "scope": "Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) has been employed in fundamental biological research for decades, however, interest for the approach as a viable means for drug development and production has only emerged in recent years. The advantages that CFPS provides in terms of efficiency, simplicity, flexibility, cost- and time savings outweigh the hurdles that are still to be overcome for CFPS to become a routine manufacturing system for peptide- or protein-based biologicals.\nCurrently, there are several CFPS systems used that are either based on prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell lysates (including mammalian) or fully synthetic systems consisting of all the molecular machinery necessary to create functional proteins. The choice of a specific lysate is dictated by the target protein and the end-use application. Proteins that require post-translational modification are generally produced using lysates of mammalian cells. Hence systems based on mammalian cells are of particular interest as they combine properties inherent to eukaryotic cells and their ability to produce human-like glycosylated proteins with the advantages of cell-free synthesis. These proteins include antibody fragments, antigens, virus-like particles, cytokines, enzymes, antimicrobial peptides and proteins containing non-natural amino acids. The benefits of CFPS are manifold, from ease of handling and scalability, on-demand launch of production, ability to rapidly switch products, simplified purification to facilitated standardisation and quality control. CFPS needs less energy resources, the manufacturing footprint is less complex and smaller than in cell cultivation and it enables production of proteins that have toxic effects on cells. In addition, CFPS has the potential as an enabling technology for personalised medicines and is amenable to decentralised manufacturing. CFPS has gained even more interest in the recent past owing to advances in synthetic biology and thanks to the rise of Machine-Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). The use of generative deep learning and artificial intelligence has high potential in the de-novo design of biomolecules with specific properties of therapeutic and/or preventive nature. CFPS offers here great opportunities to increase the throughput in screening of the de-novo created biomolecules.\nThe application of synthetic biology, potentially also combined with generative AI, and cell-free biosynthesis open up new avenues for the design, discovery and manufacture of therapeutics not only against infectious diseases, but also non-communicable diseases and equally for vaccines.\nProposals should address at least two of the following elements:\n• Address the bottlenecks that currently hamper the large-scale deployment of CFPS, i.e. the lack of a quality-by-design approach, the need to fully characterise the underlying cell lysates and their critical quality attributes and the need for better understanding of the correlations between specific cell lysate properties and CFPS process parameters, specific product quality attributes (such as protein folding), and CFPS platform performance.\n• Use synthetic biology techniques for the design of de-novo biomolecules with specific desired properties (antimicrobial, immunogenic, angiogenic, etc.) and develop suitable cell-free systems for the high-throughput screening of the designed biomolecules.\n• Develop novel or optimise existing CFPS platforms for the production of the targeted biomolecule to a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [1] conform process, producing clinical-grade material that can be tested in clinical trials.\nThe demonstration of the superiority of the developed CFPS platform as compared to the current state-of-the art production system for a specific therapeutic peptide or protein would be an asset and participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [2] is encouraged.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [3] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/eudralex/eudralex-volume-4_en\n[2] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361\n[3] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:\n• Healthcare professionals have access to behavioural interventions that can be used to establish and reinforce healthy habits and sustain behavioural changes.\n• Health professionals and educators have access to evidence-based strategies to mitigate risks of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) for youth, with clear metrics that can be used to assess health outcomes.\n• Youth have increased individual responsibility through targeted education, digital services, including easily accessible tools for self-monitoring, and community-based support, stemming from increased collaboration between healthcare professionals, educators and families.\n• Researchers have access to Real-World Data (RWD) [1] , existing health data infrastructure and digital tools, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can contribute to the sustained success of behavioural health interventions.\n• Policymakers at local, regional, national and EU levels have new knowledge on behavioural interventions on NCDs among youth, which they can use to improve interventions in diverse European contexts.",
          "scope": "The topic is focused on behavioural interventions for youth, defined as 12 to 25 years old, for the primary prevention of the top NCDs later in life, where “top NCDs” refers to the most prevalent NCDs [2] . For the purpose of this call, NCDs explicitly exclude cancer.\nImplementation research should be conducted to implement existing behavioural interventions. These interventions should be evidence-based and have an emphasis on empowerment and self-management (e.g. health literacy, health education, health promotion). As self-monitoring is an essential element of self-management, proposals should include user-friendly hardware and software for efficient self-monitoring (i.e. wearables and point-of-care devices for measuring various physiological parameters and other predictors and other biomarkers and the corresponding apps for easy readout and tracking, possibly also including gamification elements). Hardware and software should be interoperable in line with internationally accepted standards in order to avoid lock-in effects and assure scalability.\nProposals should also include most of the following aspects:\n• Ensure that gender-sensitive and intersectional approaches are integrated, addressing potential gender-specific barriers for groups at risk of discrimination, as well as cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, and should also outline how digital tools, including AI and RWD and biomarkers (e.g. genomic data, wearables, etc.) or existing relevant administrative dataset, will be integrated to enhance the scalability, personalisation, and effectiveness of interventions in the long-term.\n• Present a clear, evidence-based strategy showing how the interventions will be tailored, deployed, and assessed at individual, family, community, and societal levels, while considering social inequalities and lifestyle factors (i.e. nutrition, sleep rhythm) and ensuring a robust methodological framework for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. randomised controlled trails, quasi-experimental designs, etc.), with clearly defined indicators of success of the intervention (e.g. biometric markers, psychosocial wellbeing metrics, physical activity change, etc.). Applicants should evaluate unintended consequences for all interventions.\n• Include formats that will increase collaboration between healthcare professionals, educators, families, and policymakers in promoting preventive health and should include plans for longer-term follow-up to estimate health impact and cost savings over time. Related to this, applicants should outline how policy changes related to the intervention (e.g. school meal programmes, safe urban infrastructure for exercise, digital literacy campaigns, circadian alignment, stress reduction strategies) can reinforce and scale up successful behavioural interventions, whilst taking into account how they can be replicated or adapted to different cultural, geographic and socio-economic contexts. As such, active involvement of key stakeholders throughout the study is strongly encouraged.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, organisations as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThe proposals should adhere to the FAIR [3] data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR [4] compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [5] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] EMA definition: “Real-World Data are routinely collected data relating to patient health status or the delivery of healthcare from a variety of sources other than traditional clinical trials (e.g. claims databases, hospital data, electronic health records, registries, mhealth data, etc.)”.\n[2] The prevalence of a disease is the number of cases in a defined population at a specified point in time.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Strengthened capacity of life sciences actors in science communication, risk communication, public outreach, and citizen engagement.\n• Strengthened awareness of risks and benefits of life sciences by the public, by showcasing the latest Research and Innovation (R&I) developments in the life sciences, and their societal impact.\n• New and innovative approaches developed to engage the public in R&I activities in the life sciences, with an emphasis on inclusive and participatory approaches, involving relevant stakeholders (e.g. researchers, research funders, policymakers, publishers, civil society organisations, business, and citizens).",
          "scope": "Life science innovations significantly contribute to peoples’ daily life and to individual and social well-being. To foster public trust, people must understand how life sciences work and how these technologies may impact people’s lives.\nThis trust is not guaranteed. It is increasingly threatened by the rapid spread of mis- and disinformation and by insufficient outreach to and involvement of people to address their concerns and expectations. To maintain and deepen trust, especially among young people, R&I policymakers, researchers and industry players must be better equipped to engage with the public and to pursue responsible research and innovation.\nCitizen engagement is particularly critical in areas like agriculture and food technology, where innovation intersects with health and sustainability considerations and values. Furthermore, citizen participation is key to build trust in the life sciences and ensure that they meet societal needs. By engaging citizens early on, we can ensure that research and innovation align with their values, concerns and expectations. This involves designing research and innovation processes that incorporate citizen input, such as setting research priorities, and create outcomes that are responsive to their needs.\nTo this end, proposals should address all the following activities:\n• Provide advisory support and training to life science stakeholders, in order to upskill them in science communication and risk communication.\n• Produce, publish and advertise to the relevant actors, guidance to engage citizens upstream in the development, co-production, and co-design of life sciences innovation.\n• Produce, publish, and advertise to the relevant public an accessible repository of tools for life science stakeholders on risk communication.\n• Design and run community engagement activities in the life sciences, in partnership with relevant local actors, such as science museums, R&I organisations, and/or community organisations.\nRegarding advisory support and training, proposals should present how they will engage bilaterally with life science stakeholders to advise them and train them on science communication and risk communication in the life sciences. The proposal selected for funding should also establish links with the European Competence Centre for Science Communication [1] currently being created by the COALESCE [2] project and expected to be launched in 2027 [3] .\nRegarding engagement of citizens in the development, co-production and co-design of life sciences innovations, proposals should focus on advising and training life science actors in deliberative citizen participation and co-design with citizens, including tools that allow discussions about values and ethical considerations of innovations in this sector. Proposals should set out the ways in which they will support life science actors to involve citizens in co-design, and also set out how they will evaluate the impact of the citizen engagement activities that they have supported. The consortium selected for funding is encouraged to use the tools and methods developed under previous research and tailor them to the life sciences.\nRegarding the repository of tools and support for risk communication, such tools already exist and have been developed, notably the EU funded projects listed in the CORDIS Results Pack “Science communication: Empowering citizens in the public discussion of science” [4] , the CORDIS Results Pack “Ethics and integrity: Building bridges for trust and excellence in research and innovation” [5] and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for emergency risk communication [6] . Proposals should present what tools they will gather, how they will publish them, and what publicity and outreach they will conduct to raise awareness of this repository among the relevant life science actors (policymakers, researchers, industry, civil society organisations), tailoring tools and trainings to the life sciences. Proposals should present a long-term strategy for how the repository of tools will continue to be accessible beyond the lifecycle of this Coordination and Support Action (CSA).\nRegarding community engagement activities, proposals should experiment with new and engaging formats across the programmed activities. Proposals should promote both science education, and multiple forms of public engagement with science, focusing on the life sciences. Proposals should focus on any areas within the life sciences, but at least one community engagement activity should focus on agriculture and food technology. The consortium selected for funding is encouraged to make use of findings and tools for stakeholder engagement developed by other Horizon Europe projects, including projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-6: “Co-creation and trust-building measures for biotechnology and bio-based innovation systems”. The consortium selected for funding is also encouraged to establish links with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-07-ERA-05: “Pillar III: Fostering citizen engagement for more responsible and democratic R&I”, that will develop tools and guidelines on public engagement in R&I, and to tailor these tools and guidelines to applications in the life sciences . Proposals should explain how they will partner with relevant local actors, such as science museums, R&I organisations, and/or community organisations, to run innovative community engagement activities on the life sciences.\nProposals may consider involving the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) to participate in the advisory board of the consortium selected for funding, notably to benefit from the expertise of the JRC's Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy [7] , regarding the engagement of citizens in the design of life sciences innovations and community engagement activities. Any such collaboration should be established after the proposal’s approval.\n[1] https://scicommcentre.eu\n[2] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095230\n[3] The European Competence Centre for Science Communication will be fully established by March 2027.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Persons with disabilities are empowered and can enjoy their rights to live independently, participate in society and be included in the community on an equal basis with others.\n• The scientific community develops innovative solutions with a focus on removing barriers faced by persons with disabilities to live independently and they are provided with community support services where they live in the community.\n• Policymakers, health and care services, social and service providers, disability organisations, funders, the scientific community, and other relevant bodies are informed of the research advances and best practices addressing the health and needs of persons with disabilities to support them living independently and being included in society.",
          "scope": "The focus of this topic is human-centred on persons with long-term disabilities [1] -physical, mental, intellectual or sensory- aiming at supporting independent living across the life-course from a health perspective. Persons with disabilities have an equal right to live independently and be included in the community. Independent living requires a differentiated landscape of quality, accessible, person-centred and affordable, community- and family-based services comprising personal assistance, medical and social care and interventions by social workers, thereby facilitating everyday activities and providing choice to persons with disabilities and their families [2] .\nThe objective of this topic is to explore new ways to promote independent living and inclusion in society of persons with disabilities, reducing to the maximum possible the impact of barriers faced in their daily lives, and supporting the transition from institutions to living in the community while addressing all-encompassing aspects of personal support, such as community transformation, service provision, assistive and accessible technologies and environments.\nResearch actions under this topic should address at least three of the following areas:\n• Health related research addressing disabilities that stem from health conditions and health conditions associated to disabilities. Thus, research may look into finding the causes of the disease(s) leading to the disability and/or disease treatment with the purpose of supporting independent living. Innovative solutions could also include among others diagnoses, medicines, treatments, protocols, technologies, digital tools, low-tech solutions, etc. helping to improve the autonomy of persons with disabilities.\n• Children with disabilities from the perinatal period, and/or young people with disabilities transitioning to adulthood, and/or older persons [3] . Proposals should foster ways to improve autonomy and quality of life.\n• Access to habilitation and rehabilitation services, including psychological rehabilitation and innovative rehabilitation with assistive technologies when appropriate, to increase, maintain, substitute or improve functional capabilities of persons with disabilities or for, alleviation and compensation of impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions contributing to increasing independence.\n• Prevention of disabilities through the life-course. Different aspects that could have an impact on persons with disabilities may be addressed, such as gender, age, socio-economic background, ethnicity, detection of risks factors leading to a loss of autonomy, the risk of overweight/obesity and related co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular diseases), hospitalisation, nutrition (e.g. mother and child nutrition from pregnancy), high level of inactivity/sedentary lifestyle and related co-morbidities (e.g. frailty), physical activity/sports, screen-time dependency, smoking, drug use [4] , alcohol use, stress, psychiatric and somatic diseases, loneliness and/or isolation, etc.\n• Conditions for a successful transition from institutions to living in the community, including different tools to achieve it, such as needs assessments, service provision, budget and resources, management plans, monitoring, quality control, etc. Community support services to live independently may include personal assistance or support for decision-making, and/or disability inclusive and accessible community-based services -medical, technological, digital or other supportive initiatives- ensuring prevention of isolation or segregation and supporting deinstitutionalisation. Special attention is to be paid to children and young people transitioning to adulthood and older persons to facilitate they remain living at their homes [5] .\n• Innovative solutions, care models and strategies for high quality person-centred, accessible and targeted social and healthcare services to prevent barriers and to support independent living, including if possible, self-care to empower persons with disabilities, as well as different choices of care across the life-course. For many persons with disabilities, the lack of support and care services and insufficient support for families and unavailability of personal assistance undermines their independence and inclusion in the community.\nData collection is essential to understand the living situation of persons with disabilities and remains a challenge to collect data disaggregated per type of disability, sex, and age. In addition, data collected often lacks comparability as it follows different definitions in each Member State and Associated Country. Thus, applicants are encouraged to ensure harmonised data collection by using Eurostat standards and existing international sets of questions in their areas of research.\nPersons with disabilities should be involved in the research through their representative organisations as actors in the research process. Research can also involve their families, friends, colleagues, supporters and carers and other service providers. Policymakers and public authorities, social services, and civil society organisations, could also be considered.\nThe relevant European research infrastructures [6] in the area of health may be exploited for available digital tools and services for dataset creation, standardisation, data discovery, secure access, management, visualization, harmonization, analysis and other functions as appropriate.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, organisations as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nProjects are also encouraged to explore potential complementarities with projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-TRANSFO-09: “Good practices for increased autonomy of persons with disabilities, including physical, mental, intellectual and sensory disabilities” and topic HORIZON-HLTH-2025-03-STAYHLTH-01-two-stage: “Improving the quality of life of persons with intellectual disabilities and their families”.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [7] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others (Art. 1 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities ).\n[2] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e1e2228-7c97-11eb-9ac9-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n[3] An older person is defined by the United Nations as a person who is over 60 years of age.\n[4] If proposals concern drug addiction, they are encouraged to liaise with the EU Drugs Agency.\n[5] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C_202407188\n[6] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[7] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

          "scope": "Already before the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 in 6 people in the EU suffered from mental health issues. The economic costs of it are estimated at 4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [2] and since then these figures worsened [3] in particular among vulnerable groups such as children and adolescents or those at risk of discrimination. Digital technologies have the potential to enhance mental health for instance by providing access to information, support networks and therapy services [4] . However, there are indications that the excessive or misguided use of digital technologies, particularly among children and young adults, can negatively affect mental health and exacerbate mental disorders. There is an urgent need for more robust data to foster a safer, responsible and healthier use of digital technologies among children and young adults, prioritising the protection of their mental health.\nTherefore, proposals should aim at generating robust scientific evidence on the impact of digital technologies, as well as developing and testing context-specific digital interventions that promote the positive and responsible use of them to improve mental health, avoiding the development or exacerbation of mental disorders. These innovative digital interventions should leverage multi-source data (e.g. sleep patterns, heart rate, stress levels, screen-time analytics, social media use, biological data, clinical data), and could include the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). When handling data and indicators, sex and gender identity-disaggregated data should be collected and analysed, incorporating intersectional factors where feasible.\nThe applicants should address all the following aspects:\n• Generate the neuro-biological and cognitive/behavioural evidence base on the correlation and impact of digital technologies on mental health, including brain development (both positive and negative).\n• Develop and test innovative digital interventions aiming for example at: counteracting addictive design patterns (e.g. on social media and gaming platforms), gaining insights into risk patterns and enabling early risk detection (e.g. detecting early warning signs of mental disorders or digital addiction), redirecting users towards healthy use and positive engagement with digital technologies, and/or reducing exposure to harmful content.\n• Assess the changes in behaviour in children and young adults of the newly developed interventions, aiming at fostering their resilience and promoting responsible use and healthy digital habits.\nThe topic is open to address any mental disorder [5] caused or aggravated by the use of digital technologies such as addiction, self-harm behaviour, increased anxiety or decreased self-esteem, sleeping-disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders.\nCohort studies and clinical studies are in the scope for this topic. Applicants envisaging to include longitudinal cohort studies are invited to indicate a sustainability plan on how those cohorts are maintained over an extended period beyond the end period of the project for a long-term follow-up. They should make use of existing cohorts data when available. Applicants are welcome to consider recruiting participants transnationally and from diverse settings in the clinical study design to ensure generalizability of findings. In addition, it should be detailed in the proposal how the proposed intervention(s) could be scaled-up and transferred to other settings. Applicants should also consider the inclusion of end-users in the codesign of the interventions, for example for the young age groups, this includes the involvement of families, carers, educators. Applicants should access and make best-use of already existing European Research Infrastructures relevant for brain-research (e.g. EBRAINS [6] , Euro-BioImaging [7] ).\nAll projects funded under this topic should liaise with relevant European projects on mental health [8] and the future co-funded European Partnership for Brain Health [9] . They are also encouraged to explore potential synergies with projects to be funded under the EU4Health Work Programme 2026 related to the harmful effects of using digital technologies on the mental health of children and young adults.\nThe participation of start-ups and/or micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [10] is encouraged with the aim to strengthen their scientific and technological basis and valorise their innovations and to advance commercial exploitation.\nProposals should adhere to the FAIR [11] data principles, adopt wherever relevant, data standards and data sharing/access good practices, and apply good practices for GDPR [12] compliant personal data protection.\nThe topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The support and involvement of citizens and civil society should be considered.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [13] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] There is no universal definition of youth and young adults.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• All players along the healthcare value chain have access to evidence-based treatment and management strategies for post-infection conditions and improve patient recovery and quality of life across diverse populations.\n• Public health authorities and healthcare practitioners have access to effective prevention, diagnostic and treatment tools, ensuring better allocation of healthcare resources.\n• Healthcare systems improve their efficiency and reduce long-term economic burdens by streamlining post-infectious disease care and addressing disparities in healthcare access.\n• Public health authorities have access to evidence-based information to integrate research findings into policy for improved public health preparedness and resilience, including training of healthcare staff and enhanced long-term disease management guidelines.",
          "scope": "Microbial infections can lead to long-lasting consequences on patients’ quality of life, leading to long-term conditions characterised by persistent inflammation, organ damage, and impaired functional capacity, which pose a growing public health and economic challenge. These conditions are insufficiently understood, underdiagnosed, and lack effective treatments. Advancing research into their prevention, treatment and management is essential to improving patient outcomes, reducing healthcare burdens, and strengthening workforce productivity.\nThe topic is open to long-term conditions resulting from infections by any type of microorganism (including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi), which persist after the initial infection has been resolved. Research linked to cancer is excluded as it will be covered by the Cancer Mission.\nProposals should aim to develop innovative approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of post-infection conditions. Proposals should address most of the following research areas:\n• Identify protective and risk factors associated with the development of post-infection conditions to inform targeted prevention strategies, by integrating relevant information such as genetics, epigenetics, immune or inflammatory responses, and/or other relevant factors.\n• Increase understanding of the pathophysiology of post-infection conditions (including inflammatory aspects) to identify biomarkers and develop clinically validated diagnostic approaches for early detection, disease progression and/or treatment optimisation.\n• Develop and validate preventive and/or therapeutic interventions, including targeted pharmacological treatments, repurposing of existing drugs or precision medicine approaches, through early-stage clinical trials [1] that demonstrate clinical safety and efficacy.\n• Identify effective supportive rehabilitation approaches, including physical therapy, cognitive interventions, and psychological support, to enhance patient recovery, mental health and quality of life and evaluate their effectiveness.\n• Examine best practices for integrating post-infectious disease management into primary and specialised healthcare settings, improving coordination among healthcare professionals.\nSpecific attention should be given to sex and gender, as women often experience post-infectious diseases differently due to hormonal and other biological, as well as social factors, which can affect their diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Moreover, age, disability, racial or ethnic origin [2] , socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors should also be considered. Particular emphasis should be placed on populations in a vulnerable situation and groups with pre-existing conditions to ensure equitable and inclusive healthcare solutions.\nA multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach is encouraged, involving all relevant stakeholders (medical and non-medical), including patients, researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.\nProposals should develop a harmonised approach to collection, storage, sharing and analysis of FAIR [3] data, leveraging existing European (research) infrastructures, including biobanks or cohorts’ data [4] where relevant and contribute to emerging research infrastructures, established in the framework of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [5] and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) [6] .\nProposals should demonstrate complementarity with ongoing EU initiatives, including projects funded under relevant topics [7] , and outline plans for collaboration where applicable, to maximise synergies and avoid duplication of research efforts.\nAll projects funded under this topic are expected to participate in networking and joint activities [8] . They are also expected to engage early on with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view. Where relevant, a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) should be conducted to evaluate the clinical, economic, and social implications of interventions.\nIf applicable, applicants are encouraged to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) tools and advanced computational modelling/Virtual Human Twin (VHT)-powered tools to predict disease risk and progression, ensuring these tools are developed and tested for diverse populations to minimise bias. Hardware and software should be interoperable in line with internationally accepted standard.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nParticipation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [9] is also encouraged to strengthen their scientific and technological foundations and enhance their innovation potential.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [10] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers, policymakers, healthcare- and non-healthcare-related stakeholders and authorities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1] and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to improved insights and evidence on how to maximise collaboration and coordination with sectors and in settings beyond the healthcare system in the context of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).\n• Researchers, policymakers, healthcare- and non-healthcare-related stakeholders and authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions draw on collaborative multisectoral engagement and utilise the different settings in which people are educated, work and live, to expand efforts to reduce risks, prevent, manage and control NCDs.\n• Communities, relevant stakeholders from different sectors and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions that tackle the growing burden of NCDs through actions in sectors and settings outside the traditional health system and its facilities health-related outcomes, improve quality of life across the life course and extend healthy life expectancy.",
          "scope": "The Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) [2] . The GACD specifically addresses NCDs and supports implementation research [3] to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members (international funding agencies) and aligned with the 11 th GACD call.\nBesides health-related determinants, the burden of NCDs is also driven by structural and social inequities, population ageing, the effects of globalisation on marketing and trade, diet and activity, commercial and economic determinants of health, rapid urbanisation and climate change, factors over which a conventional healthcare-oriented system has little sway. There is a need for a comprehensive approach, involving sectors outside of health, to meet the global targets that governments have agreed upon to protect people from chronic NCDs. Tackling chronic NCDs most effectively therefore requires engagement and coordinated policy development within and across many government departments, including education, workplace, environment, social systems, housing, transportation, agriculture, food industry and nutrition, leisure and culture.\nThe aim of this topic is to fund implementation research focused on strategies to tackle the growing burden of NCDs through actions in sectors and settings outside the traditional health system [4] and its facilities (with or without the involvement of the healthcare system) to attain equitable health-related outcomes or influence health determinants for people living in LMICs, and/or underserved populations in HICs.\nProposals can focus on more than one setting and/or include cross-sectoral approaches, involving both health and non-health settings to expand efforts to reduce risks, prevent, manage and control NCDs. Safety is a major concern in non-health settings, and proposals should ensure any risks and safety considerations are addressed.\nThe choice of intervention(s) [5] and provision of existing evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, scalability and potential for long-term health and other impacts should be justified (and in what context this evidence has been generated).\nThe majority of evidence-based interventions implemented outside of the health sector focus on prevention of NCDs: relatively few focus on strategies for management of these chronic conditions, and a limited number are implemented in LMIC contexts or underserved communities. Therefore, it may be important to undertake formative research as a part of the proposal to support readiness for implementation.\nApplicants should explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) based in one or more LMICs, and/or underserved populations experiencing health disparities, including Indigenous populations, in HICs, considering the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place [6] . Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).\nProposals should address all the following implementation research activities [7] :\n• Clearly describe the implementation research methodology, including the statistical design, and provide a rationale for the implementation strategy/ies to be explored (in light of the context), the community/population group(s) to benefit, the settings and sectors involved (and how these should be engaged), the current state of the art and how the proposal improves on this, and, if used, the theories, models and/or frameworks underpinning the research.\n• Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators.\n• Specifically address issues of equitable implementation to ensure interventions reach the populations that need them the most.\n• Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy.\n• Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering the intervention and a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention (if proven effective) after the funding from the GACD grant ends.\n• Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities.\n• Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator.\nThe study population may include the general population, people with one or more existing NCDs, those currently without NCDs, or a combination of both. Applicants may propose implementation research focused on interventions that are implemented at the individual, family, community (e.g. work or school), population, and/or structural level. With regard to NCDs, applicants are encouraged to explore any chronic non-communicable condition (or combination of conditions), including mental health disorders, substance use disorders, autoimmune conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, neurological disorders and sleep disorders and/or any risk factor (or combination of risk factors). Additionally, whenever relevant, applicants are also encouraged to take a life course approach, adapting interventions for particular life stages with the goal of promoting life-long health.\nProposals should use an appropriate implementation research design and frameworks [8] , cluster Randomised Control Trials (cRCTs), before and after studies, and additional implementation science classifications of study designs (e.g. hybrid designs [9] ), noting that applicants are not limited to any particular design.\nProposals are expected to generate evidence that is of direct relevance to policymakers, communities and practitioners. Proposed work should develop a strategy to include the relevant policymakers, local authorities, as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organisations involved in the implementation of the intervention, with co-creation from the development of the proposal through to the knowledge translation phase. Project partners should be engaged from the beginning to contribute to the sustainability of the intervention after the end of project. Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the strategy, beyond the lifespan of the project.\nPoverty, discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin [10] , religion or belief, disability, age, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider relevant determinants of health (e.g. social, structural, commercial, economic) and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g. gender, racial or ethnic origin [10] , etc.), then the reason for this should be justified.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such activities and should consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [12] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] As defined by the World Bank, https://www.worldbank.org\n[2] https://www.gacd.org\n[3] https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/91758/9789241506212_eng.pdf\n[4] In this context, non-healthcare settings can include for instance: workplaces; schools, universities and other education venues (including pre-schools, nursery, etc.); faith-based communities, places of worship and traditional healers; recreation and sports clubs, fitness centres, swimming pools; prisons; communities (geographic and/or of identity) and families; community pharmacies; theatres, community spaces; retirement homes and care homes; homeless shelters; markets, malls, commercial settings; barbers, hairdressers and beauty salons; urban environments, parks, transportation (the list is not exhaustive).\n[5] Research proposals might explore implementation, outcomes and impact of context relevant strategies to implement evidence-based interventions or initiatives including (though not limited to):i) Non-health sector policy introduction, to tackle relevant social and/or structural determinants of NCDs; ii) Strategies to expand screening for NCDs and their risk factors in community, school, workplace, faith-based settings (e.g. Human Papillomavirus - HPV screening, blood pressure monitoring, blood sugar testing); ii) Partnered strategies to prevent NCDs in the community (e.g. educational campaigns, changes to school or work environments, promotion/delivery of healthy food choice and diet, opportunities for increased physical activity, strategies to support tobacco cessation and alcohol cessation); iv) Cost effective, patient centred treatment and management of NCDs in the community (e.g. mental health support, community medicine purchasing clubs, self-management groups); v) Non-health sector policy introduction e.g. environmental policy or practices (e.g. improvements to transport systems, public infrastructure) and the potential co-benefits on health; vi) Digital interventions e.g. for patient or care giver support, such as use of Artificial Intelligence for Patient support or to promote prevention messages on Chronic Disease Risk Factors).\n[6] Focus on populations facing extreme vulnerabilities, such as individuals or communities living in informal settlements, post-disaster settings, or in situations of homelessness is encouraged (though not required).\n[7] The following types of proposals are not in the scope of this topic: i) proposals with the primary aim of informing the development and/or selection of an intervention for a given context, where the implementation component will be explored in a future project (i.e. standalone feasibility projects);ii) epidemiological cohorts; iii) etiological work, mechanistic, or epidemiological research, unless an essential component of a focused study to develop implementation research approaches; iv) clinical trials, validation studies, or intervention efficacy studies for a new or established pharmacological agent or behavioural intervention.\n[8] Examples of frameworks include (this list is not exclusive): i) Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); ii) the context enhanced (RE-AIM) Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance); iii) Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) frameworks; iv) Framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions (MRC & NIHR).\n[9] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3731143 and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779135\n[10] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[11] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[12] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers, developers of medical interventions, and healthcare professionals have a better understanding of biological sex and/or gender-specific health determinants, risk factors and pathways for cardiovascular diseases.\n• Researchers, developers of medical interventions, and healthcare professionals have access and use sex and/or gender-specific or tailored risk models for better prevention, detection and diagnostic and treatment strategies.\n• Healthcare systems benefit from novel sex and/or gender-specific strategies for prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment options, resulting in reduced burden of cardiovascular diseases.",
          "scope": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of premature deaths in the EU and account for 32% of all deaths in 2021 (over 1.7 million deaths) [1] .\nBiological sex and gender play a specific role both in the incidence and the prevalence of certain diseases, including CVDs. Sex and gender disparities in CVDs are influenced by biological, behavioural, and sociocultural factors, affecting symptoms, prevalence, treatment, and outcomes. Hormonal influences, genetic predispositions, and/or physiological differences contribute to variations in how CVD presents and progresses in men and women. Risk factors such as diabetes, cholesterol, smoking, and age have different impacts across genders, highlighting the need for customised treatment strategies. Unique gender-specific conditions in women, such as menopause, pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and certain autoimmune diseases, also increase the risk for CVDs [2] .\nMainstreaming a gender perspective into the research, prevention and control of CVDs is thus crucial to understanding and addressing the health risks and needs of women and men of all ages [3] .\nAlthough the significant progress has been done in investigating sex and/or gender-specific pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, more research is needed to translate basic discoveries into the development of innovative prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment options.\nProposals should address most of the following aspects:\n• Contribute to further the understanding on the structural, hormonal, and/or biological distinctions between sexes/genders to improve diagnostics and therapeutics for CVDs.\n• Develop sex and/or gender-specific tailored risk models in a view of better prevention, detection and diagnostic, and treatment strategies.\n• Identify and/or validate novel or existing sex and/or gender-specific health determinants, risk factors and pathways for cardiovascular disease(s) through the generation, integration and validation of data derived from relevant disciplines (e.g. molecular biology, behavioural science, nutrition, clinical, social and environmental epidemiology; exposure sciences; genetics and epigenetics, etc.).\n• Make use of existing health data, including registries or cohorts, and/or assess the necessity to establish new ones, as well as, where relevant, exploit the knowledge gained from population-based biobanks. In case of the generation of new data, it should be managed in line with the FAIR [4] principles, when relevant.\nProposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures [5] in the health domain.\nThe use and/or development of new technologies, including digital ones (e.g. (generative) Artificial Intelligence) that support research under this topic is encouraged.\nDisease progression and overall health status at different life stages, as well as hormonal influences, genetic factors, etc. and psychosocial, socioeconomic, cultural and behavioural factors should be considered in the proposed research. Other intersecting factors such as racial or ethnic origin [6] , often amplify existing inequalities in health access and outcomes. Proposals should, where relevant, consider these to design effective and inclusive interventions.\nIn the context of gender-specific research, this topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [7] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nAll projects funded under this topic are encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. All projects funded under this topic are also encouraged to explore complementarities and exploit potential synergies with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-10: “Sustainable and healthy diets based on health status and socio-economic risk factors of ageing population”, once information on the funded projects is available.\nAll projects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential synergies with projects to be funded under the EU4Health Work Programme 2026 related to the gender and CVDs.\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies [8] should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.\n[1] European Union takes action for the cardiovascular health of its 440 million people - EACH: https://www.cardiovascular-alliance.eu/european-union-takes-action-for-the-cardiovascular-health-of-its-440-million-people\n[2] Gender Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease and Their Management: A Review - PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11148660\n[3] Political declaration of the 3rd High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases : resolution adopted by the General Assembly: https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1648984?v=pdf\n[4] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this Work Programme part.\n[5] The catalogue of European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) research infrastructures portfolio can be browsed on the ESFRI website: https://ri-portfolio.esfri.eu\n[6] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[7] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003H0361\n[8] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• Healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers benefit from an improved knowledge base and collaboration on the key challenges and gaps on cardiovascular health research and a conceptual framework to develop a roadmap for research and innovation is established.\n• Health systems gain improved and standardised evidence to better prevent, diagnose or treat cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated comorbidities, based on the research results on prediction, early detection, screening practices and diagnostic methods and tools, including via personalised and digital approaches.\n• Medical and non-medical health professionals and technology developers have an increased knowledge, awareness and capacity to uptake and deliver effective and innovative approaches for risk prediction, early detection, screening and health management strategies, such as Virtual Human Twins (VHT) [1] or Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications. This involves supporting, strategic foresight, improving health literacy and cross-sectoral knowledge exchange and collaboration to drive innovation in personalised prevention and cardiovascular risk prediction.\n• Healthcare providers and policymakers have an improved knowledge base to inform future strategies for early detection and prevention of CVDs, with specific attention to women and vulnerable groups, through research on personalised risk prediction approaches that consider multiple and interacting risk factors (e.g. genetic predisposition, environmental pollutants, diet, lifestyle habits, multimorbidity, sex and gender).",
          "scope": "CVDs are the main cause of death in the EU, with over 1.7 million deaths annually, costing about EUR 282 billion, or 11% of the healthcare budget [2] . With projections showing a rise in CVD prevalence and mortality by 2050 due to an aging population, the Commission is preparing a comprehensive EU Cardiovascular Health (CVH) plan [3] to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the burden of CVDs. The proposal is expected to support prevention, early detection, including via digital and personalised approaches.\nApplicants should take stock of research and innovation results to identify gaps and set up a plan for a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) on CVDs, with the final aim of leveraging research and innovation results to improve risk prediction, early detection and screening practices for CVDs and associated comorbidities, especially obesity and diabetes, across the EU and Associated Countries. This initiative addresses the pressing need to translate existing innovations and promising research results into implementable protocols that enhance prevention, diagnosis, and health outcomes for diverse populations. By fostering collaboration and integrating digital tools and methods, proposals will support the future EU CVH plan, building and aligning with future and ongoing activities, including the European VHT Initiative, the 1+Million Genomes Initiative [4] , Tech Foresight/Horizon scanning activities [5] and actions funded under the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [6] and the Digital Europe Programme [7] .\nProposals should include all the following activities:\n• Conduct a comprehensive review at national, EU, and international levels of existing cardiovascular research and innovative healthcare solutions, potentially linked with associated comorbidities, to identify gaps and areas where future integration into health systems can have the greatest impact. The mapping should build upon existing EU-level reviews and pay particular attention to sex- and gender-related gaps, including under-representation in studies and differences in risk, diagnosis, and treatment. Such insights will inform subsequent policy actions and implementation initiatives under other funding programmes.\n• Create a detailed report outlining the barriers to effective personalised prediction, screening and prevention in cardiovascular health, providing recommendations to overcome these challenges.\n• Develop a SRIA on CVDs and associated comorbidities aiming to improve personalised prevention, prediction and screening and to inform research funders and stakeholders, including relevant EU and national initiatives. The agenda will include stakeholder validation and adoption pathways. Support the development of personalised prevention and care pathways and the role of digital interventions, based on genomics, VHTs and AI-driven methods in line with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [8] Regulation, to enhance precision in early detection and health management. Where applicable, the mapping of existing practices such as biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring in patients, and stratification of patient groups should be considered.\n• Integrate sex and gender-related variables, age, racial or ethnic origin [9] , socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors, genetic predisposition into research design, data collection and analysis, to ensure inclusive and generalisable findings enhancing the effectiveness of screening, diagnostic, and prevention strategies across diverse population groups.\n• Organise high-impact, targeted events with clear objectives to promote a multi-sectorial approach, fostering collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, civil society, patients' organisations, and policymakers\n• Work with health experts to develop the capacities for implementing standardised screening protocols and methods.\n• Develop a comprehensive dissemination strategy and stakeholder engagement plan to share findings and promote the results, utilising online platforms and social media to reach a broad audience. Complement with long-term engagement mechanisms such as policy briefings or partnerships with EU-level dissemination networks.\nThe applicants should ensure adequate involvement across the project lifespan of all relevant stakeholders and value chain actors including industry, healthcare professionals, scientists, patients’ associations to ensure performance and sustainability and maximise the final impact.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, in order to meaningfully enhance the societal impact of the related research activities.\n[1] See the European Virtual Human Twins Initiative: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/virtual-human-twins\n[2] European Union takes action for the cardiovascular health of its 440 million people - EACH: https://www.cardiovascular-alliance.eu/european-union-takes-action-for-the-cardiovascular-health-of-its-440-million-people\n[3] https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15315-2024-INIT/en/pdf\n[4] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes\n[5] Farinha, J., Nagy, O., Bailey, G., Mochan, A., Polvora, A. et al., Embodying the Future - Horizon scanning for emerging technologies and breakthrough innovations in the field of human-like AI systems, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2025, https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC143535\n[6] https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/eu4health_en\n[7] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\n[8] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[9] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.",

Financial and operational capacity and exclusion\nFinancial and operational capacity and exclusion are described in\nAnnex C\nof the Work Programme General Annexes.\n\n6. Legal and financial set-up of the grants\nThis action is intended to be implemented in the form of an amendment of the grant agreement concluded pursuant to Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.\nFor the additional activities covered by this action:\nThe funding rate is 50% of the eligible costs. This is justified by the pooling of proposers' in-kind contributions and in-house activities and by the nature of activities to be performed: in addition of joint calls, highly integrative activities (EU clinical trial preparedness, training, patients’ empowerment activities etc.) contributing to enhance the rare disease research and innovation ecosystem in the EU and Associated Countries, and beyond.\nBeneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP). The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. As a co-funded European Partnership, providing financial support to third parties is a core activity of this action in order to achieve its objectives. Consequently, the EUR 60 000 threshold laid down in Article 207 of Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 does not apply. The maximum amount of FSTP that may be awarded to any single third party for the duration of the partnership is set at EUR 10.00 million. This ceiling is justified by the fact that FSTP is a primary activity of this action, by its expected duration of 7-10 years (exceeding a standard project lifespan), and by the extensive experience gained under predecessor partnerships. This ceiling is also justified by the fact that research on rare diseases, in particular clinical research, is complex and costly to put in place due to the scarcity, for each disease, of patients, of knowledge, of clinicians and of researchers, and by the request, if possible, to group diseases for research purposes, in order to tackle several diseases out of the estimated 6-8.000 rare diseases. However, if the objectives of the action would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult (and duly justified in the proposal) the maximum amount may be higher.\nThe starting date of the grant awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the application. Applicants must justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their application. Costs incurred from the starting date of the action may be considered eligible (and will be reflected in the entry into force date of the amendment to the grant agreement).\nThe granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.\nLegal and financial set-up of the grants are described in\nAnnex G\nof the Work Programme General Annexes.",

          "expected_outcome": "This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes:\n• The EU is reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of research and innovation in Rare Diseases (RD) and thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to rare diseases.\n• Research funders align, adopt and implement their RD research policies allowing for the optimal generation and translation of knowledge into meaningful health products and interventions responding to the needs of people living with a rare disease across Europe and globally.\n• The RD research community at large benefit from and use an improved comprehensive knowledge framework and cross-border FAIR [1] data access and analysis, including rare diseases registries, by integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve translational research.\n• People living with a rare disease, including those from underrepresented communities, benefit from a more timely, equitable access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality healthcare including novel diagnosis and treatments, taking stock of highly integrated research and healthcare systems.\n• Researchers, innovators -as well as people living with a rare disease and their advocates (as co-creators)- effectively constitute and operate into an integrated research and innovation ecosystem to deliver cost-effective diagnosis and treatments.\n• Public and private actors, including civil society (e.g. Non-Governmental Organisations, charities), establish coordinated and efficient multi-stakeholder collaborations at EU and national (including regional) levels, allowing for more effective clinical research, for example aiming at improved success rates of therapeutic development.",
          "scope": "This topic targets an action under Article 24(2) HE Regulation aiming to add additional activities to existing grant agreements, together with additional partners (if relevant) that would deliver on those activities. The award of a grant to continue the partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-07-01: “European Partnership on Rare Diseases” and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation. Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of the topic HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-07-01: “European Partnership on Rare Diseases” and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should present the additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award primarily in terms of grant agreement revisions. The existing action, the “European Rare Diseases Research Alliance” (ERDERA) can only reasonably be enhanced and enlarged on the basis of the existing consortium [2] , as the co-funded framework established cannot simply be replaced without significant disruption, given the top-quality, long-term expertise and wide coverage of the beneficiaries comprising this consortium.\nThe proposal should thus present the specific additional activities (including, if relevant, additional partners) foreseen for the second instalment of the partnership. The partnership should continue to contribute to priorities of the communication “On effective, accessible and resilient health systems” (COM(2014) 215 final) [3] , the “Communication from the Commission on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM(2018) 233 final) [4] , the \"Council conclusions on the Future of the European Health Union: A Europe that cares, prepares and protects\" (9900/24) [5] and support the objectives of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027) [6] .\nThis partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe [7] , in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs and catalysing the clinical development of medicines for rare diseases (i.e. “orphan medicinal products”) and ensuring that the benefits of research and innovation reach patients in the EU and the Associated Countries. Moreover, the partnership is expected to contribute and align with the objectives of the Directive 2911/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare [8] and of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) [9] .\nThanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policymakers), the partnership will strengthen the European Research Area and consolidate the European research and innovation ecosystem with a critical mass of resources, and implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) [10] .\nThe co-funded European Partnership on Rare Diseases should be implemented based on the priorities identified in the SRIA and through a joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating and funding transnational and clinical research to highly integrative and community-driven ‘in-house’ activities such as innovation strategies for the efficient exploitation of research results, EU clinical trial preparedness activities, optimisation of research infrastructures [11] and resources, including networking, training and dissemination activities. To this end, proposals are expected to build on the first phase of this partnership and should be structured along the following main objectives:\n• Launch joint transnational calls for RD research and innovation actions, aligned with SRIA priorities, to fund patient-need-driven research across Europe, ensuring effective cross-border collaboration and scalability, while demonstrating short, medium and long-term impact and value creation through financial support to third parties and a rigorous monitoring strategy of research outputs.\n• Further establish, strengthen and develop the different components of a European Clinical Research Network (CRN) to boost clinical trial readiness and capacity to readily implement well-coordinated multi-national clinical studies on rare diseases, building on the European Reference Networks (ERNs). The partnership is expected to showcase the CRN’s contribution to the cost-effective therapeutic development and decrease in diagnostic timelines linked with improvement in health outcomes ensuring durable collaboration among research, clinical, and regulatory actors.\n• Advance and consolidate the capacity building of the RD data ecosystem by supporting interoperable and/or federated cross-border access and analysis of FAIR research and healthcare data, including rare disease registries, ensuring ongoing their usability more efficient translational and clinical research, including regulatory science. The relevant European research infrastructures in the area of health should be exploited for available services, expertise and digital tools for the management and analyses of FAIR health data, as appropriate.\n• Integrate basic, pre-clinical, clinical and implementation research to streamline the Research and Innovation (R&I) continuum and minimise redundancies, ensuring lasting impact on the quality of life of the people living with a rare disease while strengthening systemic efficiency and cost-effectiveness. To that end, the partnership should mobilise a significant investment to spur innovation, by aligning regional, national and European R&I priorities and improving EU competitiveness in R&I.\n• Support research and innovation across key intervention areas (prevention, diagnosis, treatment), and promote the sustainable uptake of existing health innovations in clinical practice through coordinated training, implementation research, and active stakeholder engagement.\n• Contribute to and align with the International Rare Disease Research Consortium (IRDiRC) [12] to reinforce Europe’s global leadership, ensure policy coherence, and sustain long-term strategic alignment beyond the lifetime of the partnership. To that end, an optimised assessment of the European contribution to IRDiRC would be beneficial to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nCollaboration with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) should be considered to materialise the sharing of (meta)data regarding registries for rare diseases, exchanging data for clinical studies and research based on a unified pseudonymisation tool provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) and related tools and services, as well as in other areas of mutual interest, such as training and capacity building.\n[1] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this Work Programme part.\n[2] Consortium which was awarded the grant under topic HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-07-01: “European Partnership on Rare Diseases”.\n[3] https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/communication-commission-com2014-215-final_en\n[4] https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-communication-com-2018-233_en\n[5] https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/06/21/european-health-union-council-calls-on-commission-to-keep-health-as-a-priority\n[6] https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/eu4health_en\n[7] https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/pharmaceutical-strategy-europe_en\n[8] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2011/24/oj/eng in particular articles 12 and 13 respectively on European Reference Networks (ERNs) and rare diseases\n[9] https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en\n[10] https://erdera.org/strategic-research-innovation-agenda-sria\n[11] The relevant European research infrastructures in the area of health should be exploited for available services, expertise and digital tools for dataset creation, standardisation, data discovery, secure access, management, visualisation, harmonisation, analysis and other functions as appropriate.

          "scope": "Infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is already being accelerated by climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the development of antiviral prophylactics and therapeutics in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of antivirals targeting conserved viral or host mechanisms would provide a critical preparedness measure against future health threats caused by (re)emerging infectious disease epidemics or pandemics, due to infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.\nThis topic contributes to strengthening the Research and Innovation ecosystem within the EU and supports the implementation of the European Medical Countermeasures Strategy [1] .\nAntibodies and antibody derived proteins are excluded from the scope of this topic.\nApplicants should explicitly state in their proposal which of the following viruses/groups of viruses is targeted and the proposed work should address only this specific virus/group of viruses. The proposed work should aim to advance the development of novel or existing antiviral candidates targeting exclusively one of the following viruses/groups of viruses:\n• Junin mammarenavirus and/or Lassa mammarenavirus\n• Tick-borne encephalitis virus and/or Japanese encephalitis virus\n• Andes virus and/or Hantaan virus and/or Sin Nombre virus\n• Hendra virus\n• Enterovirus D68\n• Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus\nIdentifying a specific virus/group of viruses does not preclude the exploration of these antiviral candidates' effects on other viruses/groups of viruses. Proposals should thus aim to diversify and accelerate the global prophylactic and therapeutic research and development portfolio for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the leading role of the EU in prophylactic and therapeutic research and development.\nProposals should address some of the following research areas:\n• Discovery and selection of candidate antivirals with consideration for intra-family and/or variant-transcending potential.\n• Optimisation of selected candidates to improve potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and developability, using Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) studies or equivalent methodologies.\n• In-vitro characterisation of antiviral activity, mechanism of action, and, where appropriate, resistance potential across multiple viruses or strains.\n• In-vivo tests in at least one animal model or, if available in human organoid or organotypic models, to demonstrate the protective function of the antiviral candidates and deemed sufficient for moving to first clinical trials.\n• If requested by regulators as pre-requisite for clinical studies, in-vivo tests in a non-human primate model.\n• Production of batches of the most promising antiviral candidates according to the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [2] of the most promising therapeutics solution.\n• First in human clinical safety studies demonstrating a clear regulatory pathway for market authorisation. Attention should be paid to critical biological and social factors such as sex, age, ethnicity and disability.\nParticipation of third countries where viruses addressed in the proposal are endemic or where outbreaks have occurred or are ongoing is encouraged.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [3] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nAll projects funded under this topic are expected to engage with regulatory bodies in a timely manner to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view.\nProposals should advance research by leveraging already existing and emerging state-of-the-art research infrastructures [4] such as those having contributed to the services developed under the ISIDORe project [5] .\nThe projects funded under this topic should synergise with projects funded by the co-funded European Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness [6] .\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [7] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

          "scope": "The rapid rise of AMR presents a formidable threat to public health, challenging our ability to treat infections that were once easily managed with standard antimicrobials. As pathogens continually adapt and develop resistance to existing drugs, the efficacy of these treatments diminishes, leading to more severe and prolonged illnesses, increased healthcare costs and productivity losses, and higher mortality rates. This escalating crisis underscores an urgent need for viable therapeutic alternatives required to reduce the burden of diseases caused by antibiotic resistance. Innovative solutions are crucial to maintaining effective disease management and safeguarding public health.\nProposals should pursue the development of innovative and effective antibacterial and antifungal agents, including antibody-based therapies, which meet at least one of the four World Health Organization (WHO) innovation criteria [1] , namely: i) new chemical class, ii) new target, iii) new mode of action and iv) no evidence of cross-resistance.\nThis topic contributes to strengthening the Research and Innovation ecosystem within the EU and supports the implementation of the European Medical Countermeasures Strategy [2] and the forthcoming Critical Medicines Act [3] .\nProposals under this topic should not pursue the development of phage-therapies.\nApplicants should explicitly state in their proposal which of the following pathogens is targeted and the proposed work should address only this specific pathogen. The proposed work should pursue the development of existing therapeutic candidates targeting exclusively one of the following pathogens:\n• Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (CRAB)\n• Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (C3GRE)\n• Carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n• Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\n• (Drug)-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus\n• (Drug)-resistant Candida spp\nIdentifying a specific pathogen does not preclude the exploration of these candidates' effects on other bacteria or fungi. Proposals should thus aim to accelerate testing of novel candidates in human trials, diversify and accelerate the global prophylactic and therapeutic research and development portfolio for AMR bacterial and fungal infections, and to strengthen the leading role of the EU in prophylactic and therapeutic research and development.\nProposals should address all the following areas:\n• If necessary, finalisation of in-vivo tests in at least one animal model or, if available in humanised immune system animal models, to demonstrate the protective function of the therapeutics deemed sufficient for moving to first clinical trials.\n• If requested by regulators as pre-requisite for clinical studies, in-vivo tests in a non-human primate model.\n• Production of batches of the most promising antimicrobials candidates according to the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [4] .\n• In human clinical safety and efficacy studies, demonstrating a clear regulatory pathway for market authorisation. Attention should be paid to critical biological and social factors such as sex, age, ethnicity, disability and vulnerability.\nParticipation of third countries where AMR bacteria and fungi in the proposal are endemic or where outbreaks have occurred or are ongoing is encouraged.\nThe participation of start-ups, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [5] is encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation.\nAll projects funded under this topic are expected to engage with regulatory bodies in a timely manner to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view.\nProposals should advance research by leveraging already existing and emerging state-of-the-art research initiatives such as the co-funded European Partnership on One Health Anti-Microbial Resistance (EUP OHAMR) [6] .\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [7] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

          "expected_outcome": "This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:\n• Researchers, healthcare practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1] and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to improved insights and evidence on how to equitably promote the early prevention, risk reduction, and timely diagnosis of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in children and/or young people.\n• Policymakers, public health managers and authorities, parents and their children, and young adults have access to evidence and recommendations for national programmes and policies to improve quality of life in children and/or young people and extend healthy life expectancy.\n• Researchers, clinicians, policymakers, public health managers and authorities have an improved understanding how to effectively adapt and/or scale up interventions for prevention and management of chronic NCDs in children and/or young people at local, regional, and national levels.\n• Communities, parents and their children, young adults, local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions that tackle NCDs in children and/or young people.",
          "scope": "The Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) [2] . The GACD specifically addresses NCDs and supports implementation research [3] to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members (international funding agencies) and aligned with the 12 th GACD call.\nChronic NCDs that begin in childhood have an impact on both quality of life and life expectancy. Onset of many NCDs diseases occurs at younger ages in LMICs, and this is further accompanied by a longer duration of disease and a higher rate of complications, including multimorbidity. The conditions in which people are born, grow and live (the social determinants of health) including access to good nutrition, education, housing, and healthcare are major contributors to health and ill health [4] .\nUp to 70% of preventable adult deaths from NCDs are linked to risk factors originating in childhood and adolescence [5] , and interventions that can successfully control or prevent chronic disease in young people can dramatically improve health outcomes later in life. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods, when behaviours associated with NCD risk are adopted including tobacco use, alcohol use, substance abuse, unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles and children and young people are often targeted by commercial marketing of unhealthy products.\nThe aim of this topic is to fund implementation research, exploring strategies, evidence-based program and policy interventions across prevention, diagnosis, screening and management of chronic NCDs, centred on the critical life stages spanning early childhood to young adulthood (1-24 years of age) living in LMICs, and/or underserved populations in HICs.\nIn this regard, proposals focused on implementation research should explore implementation strategies on evidence-based interventions, adaptations of interventions and tailored interventions, or initiatives including (though not limited to) those focussed on one or more of the following:\n• Policy evaluation to tackle childhood- and/or youth-relevant social, economic, political, structural or commercial determinants of chronic NCD conditions.\n• Prevention of NCDs using children and/or young people targeted implementation strategies (e.g. educational strategies, vaccination strategies, promotion of behavioural and lifestyle changes).\n• Screening and diagnosis of NCDs (or risk factors) in children and/or young people (in particular use of digital tools).\n• Cost effective and patient-centred management of NCDs in children and/or young people (including access to medicines and equipment; integrated care pathways; continuity of care for adolescents with existing non-communicable diseases who \"age out\" of paediatrics, caregiver health and support, citizen science approaches).\nMultiple interventions focus on prevention of NCDs in children and young people, yet relatively few have focussed on strategies for management of chronic conditions in these critical life stages, and a limited number of studies have been carried out to study implementation of these in LMIC contexts or with underserved communities. In this instance it would be anticipated that proposals should explore implementation strategies using the appropriate hybrid design study incorporating effectiveness and implementation research outcomes. Therefore, it may be important to undertake formative research as a part of the proposal to support readiness for implementation.\nThe proposed implementation research should be focused on one or more evidence-based interventions (or complex interventions), providing existing evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, scalability and potential for long-term health and other impacts (and in what context this evidence has been generated).\nApplicants should provide rationale and explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) based in one or more LMICs, and/or underserved populations experiencing health disparities, including Indigenous populations, in HICs, considering the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place [6] . Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).\nProposals should address all the following implementation research activities [7] :\n• Clearly describe the implementation research methodology, including the statistical design.\n• Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators.\n• Specifically address issues of equitable implementation to ensure interventions reach the populations that need them the most.\n• Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy.\n• Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering the intervention and a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention (if proven effective) after the funding from the GACD grant ends.\n• Provide opportunities for NCD-focused implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities.\n• Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator.\nThe study population may include children and/or young people in the general population, with one or more existing NCDs, those currently without NCDs, or a combination of any of the above. Applicants may propose implementation research focused on interventions that are implemented at the individual, family, community (e.g. work or school), population, and/or structural level. With regard to NCDs, applicants are encouraged to explore any chronic non-communicable condition (or combination of conditions), including mental health disorders, autoimmune conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, neurological disorders and sleep disorders and/or any risk factor (or combination of risk factors). Additionally, whenever relevant, applicants are also encouraged to take a life course approach, adapting interventions for particular life stages with the goal of promoting life-long health.\nProposals should use an appropriate implementation research design and framework [8] , before and after studies, and additional implementation science classifications of study designs (e.g. hybrid designs [9] ), noting that applicants are not limited to any particular design.\nProposals would be expected to generate evidence that is of direct relevance to policymakers, communities and practitioners. Proposed work should identify and engage all key stakeholders necessary and relevant to the development, undertaking and knowledge translation phases of the project, including meaningful collaboration with young people themselves (and their families). Proposals should also consider using co-development and co-design approaches, involving policymakers, local authorities, community groups, educators, healthcare providers, and other individuals or organisations necessary to the delivery and sustainability of the study outcomes. Project partners should be engaged from the beginning to contribute to the sustainability of the intervention after the end of project. Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the strategy, beyond the lifespan of the project.\nPoverty, discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin [10] , religion or belief, disability, age, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider relevant determinants of health (e.g. social, structural, commercial, economic) and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g. gender, racial or ethnic origin [10] , etc.), then the reason for this should be justified.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nAll projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such activities and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.\nApplicants should provide details of their clinical studies [12] in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.\n[1] As defined by the World Bank, https://www.worldbank.org\n[2] https://www.gacd.org\n[3] https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/91758/9789241506212_eng.pdf\n[4] https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003306689-20/social-determinants-health-ncds-ruth-bell-jaime-miranda-jean-woo-michael-marmot\n[5] https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/noncommunicable-diseases/\n[6] Focus on populations facing extreme vulnerabilities, such as individuals or communities living in informal settlements, post-disaster settings, or in situations of homelessness is encouraged (though not required).\n[7] The following types of proposals are not in the scope of this topic: i) proposals with the primary aim of informing the development and/or selection of an intervention for a given context, where the implementation component will be explored in a future project (i.e. standalone feasibility projects); ii) epidemiological cohorts; iii) etiological work, mechanistic, or epidemiological research, unless an essential component of a focused study to develop implementation research approaches; iv) clinical trials, validation studies, or intervention efficacy studies for a new or established pharmacological agent or behavioural intervention.\n[8] Examples of frameworks include (this list is not exclusive): i) Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); ii) the context enhanced (RE-AIM) Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance); iii) Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) frameworks; iv) Framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions (MRC & NIHR).\n[9] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3731143 and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779135\n[10] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[11] The use of the term ‘racial or ethnic origin’ does not imply an acceptance of theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n[12] Please note that the definition of clinical studies (see introduction to this Work Programme part) is broad and it is recommended that you review it thoroughly before submitting your application.",
